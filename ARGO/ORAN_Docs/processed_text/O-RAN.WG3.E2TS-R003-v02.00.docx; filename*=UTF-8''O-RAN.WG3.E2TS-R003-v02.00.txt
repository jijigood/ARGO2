Conformance testing Near-RT RIC

General

Test configuration

The test configuration for E2 conformance testing of Near-RT RIC is illustrated in Figure 4.2.21 which shows a test setup that employs an E2 Node simulator, O-RU simulator, and UE simulator as a simplification.  A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of an O-RU with associated M-Plane support and also a real UE or test UE.

In as much as the conformance testing involves configuring the E2 Nodes and the Near- RT RIC, it shall be performed by means of the O1 interface. Configuration of the E2 Nodes and Near-RT RIC to operate in nominal state via the O1 interface and configuring for policy guidance and enrichment data to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface are outside

the scope of this test specification.

Figure 4.2.21 Illustration of Near-RT RIC E2 conformance test setup

Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrated Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node simulator may support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4.  Examples include:

-	Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and one or more standalone O-DU.   Each logical node is considered as an E2 Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

-	Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components

-	Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  The combined node may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN components.The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC are bundled with some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the specification.

Bundle the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

Bundle the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU

Device Under Test (Near-RT RIC)

For enabling conformance testing, the Near-RT RIC has implemented the E2 interface, and the procedures specified in “O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol” [2] that are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. It may also support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in “ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM” [5], “ORAN WG3: E2SM NI” [4] and “ORAN WG3: E2SM RC” [6] respectively.

The DUT, Near-RT RIC, may comply to only a subset of E2 procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to compliance claimed by a DUT are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 5.2.

Testing Tools

The E2 Node simulator simulates the E2 functionalities of the E2 Node side and have flexibility to generate, receive and validate messages for all the E2 global procedures and certain or all of the E2 service models. The test simulator logs all message content during the testing.

The test simulator has all the capabilities needed to operate the E2 test cases, including:

Generate E2 Node initiated procedures.

Receive Near-RT RIC initiated procedures.

Generate responses for either successful or unsuccessful operations with appropriate cause value in case of failure.

The test simulator should support all the RAN configurations discussed in clause 4.2.2, except those excluded in this version of the specification as described above.

The E2 Node simulator may also logically simulate the UE functions from the Near-RT RIC point of view, enabling meaningful cell and UE specific E2 services to run. Only the UE functions sufficient to facilitate the E2 interface focused conformance testing are simulated.

Conformance testing E2 Nodes

General

Test configuration

The test configuration for E2 conformance testing of different types of E2 Nodes are illustrated in Figure 4.3.21. The test setup employs a Near-RT RIC simulator, O-RU simulator, Core simulator and UE simulator as a simplification.  A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of real equipment. Configuring E2 Nodes to bring it to nominal operating state via the O1 is outside the scope of this test specification.

Figure 4.3.21  Illustration of  E2-Node conformance test setup

Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node may support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4.  Examples include:

-	Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and one or more standalone O-DU.   Each logical node is considered as an E2 Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

-	Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components

-	Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  The combined node may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC Simulator for each logical O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.

The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC is bundled with some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the specification.

Device Under Test (E2 Node)

The DUT could be of any E2 Node of the following type

O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP or O-DU

Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU

Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

O-DU

O-eNB

For conformance testing the E2 Node has E2AP interface and implements procedures specified in “O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol” [2] that are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. It may support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in “ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM” [5], “ORAN WG3: E2SM NI” [4] and “ORAN WG3: E2SM RC” [6] respectively.

The DUT (E2 Node ) may comply to only a subset of E2AP procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to compliance claimed by a DUT are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 6.2.

Testing Tools

The Near-RT RIC simulator simulates the E2 functionalities of Near-RT RIC and has flexibility to generate, receive and validate messages for all the E2AP procedures and certain or all of the E2 service models. The test simulator logs all message contents during the testing.

The test simulator has all the capabilities needed to operate the E2 test cases, including:

Generate Near-RT RIC initiated procedures.

Receive E2 Node initiated procedures.

Generate responses for either successful or unsuccessful operations with appropriate cause value in case of failure.

The Test simulator (Near-RT RIC)  should support all the RAN configurations discussed in clause 4.3.2, except those excluded in this version of the specification as described above.

The test setup has the DUT (E2 Node) connect to other test equipment. These can be real or simulated UEs, RAN elements and Core (EPC or 5GC) to support scenarios appropriate for the E2 functionality being tested. An SMO with O1 interface is also included optionally if the E2 Node or any of real or simulated elements need configuration or operation to function.

Interoperability Testing between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node

General

FFS

Test configuration

The test configuration for interoperability testing between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node(s) is illustrated in figure 4.4.2-1 which shows a test setup that employs a Non-RT RIC simulator, Core Simulator, O-RU simulator, and UE simulator as a simplification. A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of a real O-RU with associated M-Plane support and also a real UE or test UE.

In as much as the interoperability testing involves configuring the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node, it shall be performed by means of the O1 interface. Configuration of the Near-RT RIC and E2 Node to operate in nominal state via the O1 interface, and configuring for policy guidance and enrichment data to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface are outside the scope of this test specification.

Figure 4.4.2-1 Illustration of interoperability between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node test setup

Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node may support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4.  Examples include:

-	Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and one or more standalone O-DU.   Each logical node is considered as an E2 Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.

-	Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components

-	Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  The combined node may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components

In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.

The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC is bundled with some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the specification.

System Under Test (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node)

The System Under Test (SUT) consist of  Near-RT RIC and  E2 Node.
The E2 Node can be of any of the following type:

O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP or O-DU

Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU

Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

O-DU

O-eNB

For enabling interoperability testing, the Near-RT RIC and E2 Node have implemented the E2 interface, and the procedures specified in “O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol” [2] that are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. They may also support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in “ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM” [5], “ORAN WG3: E2SM NI” [4],  “ORAN WG3: E2SM RC” [6] and “ORAN WG3: E2SM CCC” [10] respectively.

Each element of the SUT, Near-RT RIC and E2 Node, may comply to only a subset of E2 procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to procedures supported by both Near-RT and E2 Node are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 7.

Testing Tools

The test setup has the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) connected to other test equipments. These can be real or simulated UEs, O-RU, RAN elements, Core (EPC or 5GC) and Non-RT RIC to support scenarios appropriate for the E2 functionality being tested. An SMO with O1 interface is also included optionally if the Near-RT RIC, E2 Node or any of real or simulated elements need configuration or operation to function.

In addition, a TAP interface can be used on E2 interface between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node to passively capture and analyze packets for test case validation. Alternatively, E2 logs from the SUT can be used for protocol analysis.

Step 6. Take appropriate action to initiate on the E2 Node one of the following E2 Node system configuration changes
-	Adding a new E2 Node Component Configuration
-	Updating an existing E2 Node Component Configuration
-	Removing an existing E2 Node Component Configuration

Step 7. E2 Node triggers E2 Node Configuration Update procedure by sending E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the Near-RT RIC.

Near-RT RIC sends E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the E2 Node.

Measurement Type IE in the RIC INDICATION messages is the same as that in RIC SUBSCRITPION REQUEST message

During the period covered by step 4, where the selected UE is matching the agreed condition, the UE ID IE of the selected UE in the Test Equipment is present in List of matched UE IDs IE of the RIC INDICATION messages sent by the E2 Node

 During the period covered by step 5, where the selected UE is not matching the agreed condition, the UE ID IE of the selected UE in the Test Equipment is absent from List of matched UE IDs IE of the RIC INDICATION messages sent by the E2 Node. List of matched UE IDs IE is omitted if no UE is matching the agreed condition during the reporting period

Measurements reported by E2 Node in RIC Indication messages are consistent with the traffic simulated by the Test Equipment for the specified UE Id

If an Error Indication procedure is triggered during the test, then the test result shall be determined as failed.

If the agreed RIC Action ID IE is present in the RIC Actions Not Admitted List IE of RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message, then the test result shall be determined as failed.

RIC Subscription Delete procedure with RIC Event Trigger Style 1

Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to test the interoperability of Near-RT RIC and E2 Node for RIC Subscription Delete as specified in [2] clause 8.2.2 for Service Model “O-RAN-E2SM-KPM” as specified in [5].
The expected outcome is successful RIC Subscription Delete procedure by the SUT.

This test case is mandatory if the SUT (Near-RT and E2 Node) claims to support any RAN function in “O-RAN-E2SM-KPM” Service Model using RIC Event Trigger Style 1.

Test Entrance Criteria

Each element of the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) supports a common RAN Function in “O-RAN-E2SM-KPM” Service Model using RIC Event Trigger Style 1

Each element of the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) supports RIC Subscription Delete procedure for the above RAN Function

A reporting period for the measurement is agreed and configured in the SUT. The test duration is then selected to allow to cover several reporting periods

The RAN Function to which RIC subscribes and the RAN Function definition are predefined and shared between the elements of the SUT (Near RT RIC and E2 Node).). A Measurement Type as specified in [5] clause 8.3.9 is agreed to be included in the RIC Subscription. An example of the agreed RAN Function Definition IE defined in [5] clause 8.2.2.1 is shown in table below

The SUT has functionality to trigger RIC Subscription Delete procedure

Test Methodology

Initial conditions

The elements of the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) are connected by E2 interface

E2 Setup procedure is successfully completed in the SUT with the agreed RAN Function Definition IE

RIC Subscription procedure is successfully completed in the SUT with the agreed RIC Request ID and RAN Function ID

Procedure

Step 1. Enable the protocol analyzer to capture, record and decode the E2 signalling between SUT elements via the TAP interface.

	Step 2. Perform the RIC Subscription Delete procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

Initiate appropriate action or configuration in the SUT to trigger the RIC Subscription Delete procedure

	Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUEST message to the E2 Node, with the agreed RIC Request ID and RAN Function ID

	E2 Node sends RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE to the Near-RT RIC with the agreed RIC Request ID and RAN Function ID

	Step 3. The test is ended after the test duration defined in test entrance criteria, allowing the E2 Node to cover several Reporting periods after the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE message is received

Expected results

The test is considered passed if

All messages are correctly decoded by the protocol analyser

E2 logs recorded in the protocol analyzer are aligned with successful operation message flows specified in [2] clause 8.2.2.

RIC Subscription Delete procedure is successful and it is validated in recorded E2 logs that
- RAN Function ID IE corresponds to the agreed RAN Function (during E2 Setup procedure and RIC Subscription procedure) in both RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUEST and RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE messages
- RIC REQUEST ID IE is the same as that in RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST, RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE and RIC INDICATION messages

- RIC REQUEST ID IE corresponds to the agreed RIC Request ID (during RIC Subscription procedure) in both the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUEST and RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE messages

No RIC Indication messages are sent for the agreed RAN Function ID and RIC Request ID after the E2 Node sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE message

If an Error Indication procedure is triggered during the test, then the test result shall be determined as failed.

If RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE FAILURE message is sent by E2 Node, then the test result shall be determined as failed.
