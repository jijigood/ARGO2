4	Objective

The present document delivers a specification of the information elements and attributes applicable to the ASD.

5	Conventions

The attributes of the ASD information elements are described in the tables provided in section 6.2. Each table has 5 columns, with the following significance:

The "Attribute" column provides the attribute name.

The "Qualifier" column indicates whether the support of the attribute is mandatory, optional or conditional from the SMO perspective.

The "Cardinality" column contains the minimum and maximum cardinality of this information element (e.g., 1, 0 … N, 1 … N). A cardinality range starting with 0 indicates that the attribute need not always be included and 1 indicates that the attribute needs to be always included.

The "Type" column provides information on the type of the attribute values. It can be the name of an Information Element. If a cell in the "Type" is marked as "Not specified", which indicates that the specification of the type is left to the data model.

The "Description" provides a brief explanatory description, additional constraints, and examples.

6	Application Service Descriptor information elements

6.1 	Overview

The Application Service Descriptor (ASD) contains data that describes an application and that is used by the SMO as input for the deployment of the application workload.

The ASD is a complementary descriptor to the cloud-native deployment artifacts. Hence, it contains design-time information provided by the application vendor that is not described/available in the cloud native artifacts. Such complementary information in the ASD can include specific infrastructure capabilities requirements for the deployment of the application software workload, constraints on the Kernel type needed, additional networking requirements needed beyond primary connectivity described in the cloud native artifacts, any special CNI (Container Network Interfaces), etc [i.1].

ASD can support an application workload deployment on OS container infrastructures, and it is applicable to O-RAN NF Deployments, xApps, and rApps.

Figure 6.1-1 illustrates the representation of O-RAN OAM Application Packaging Model as depicted in version 10.00 of [i.2] and shows how the Application Service Descriptor is positioned within the Application Package Model.

Description

trunkMode

M

0..1

Boolean

Specifies whether the interface is capable of carrying traffic for multiple VLANs.

If not present or set to false: this interface shall connect to single network.

If set to true: the network interface shall be a trunk interface (connects to multiple VLANs).

ipam

M

0..1

Enum

Specifies which mode is used for the IP address assignment.

Values:

"infraProvided": the CNI specifies how IPAM is done and assigns the IP address to the pod interface.

"orchestrated": the IP address to be assigned to the pod interface is expected from the orchestration function as input parameter to the deployment request.

"userManaged": the IP address is provided directly to the application via an external management entity.

Default value is "infraProvided".

interfaceType​

M

0..1

Enum

Specifies the type of network interface. Different types of interfaces are supported by different CNIs.

Values:

"kernel.netdev”: Linux kernel or vSwitch based. It is supported by CNIsTM like: OVS, MACVLAN, IPVLAN, BRIDGE, PTP, etc.

"direct.userspace": Provides direct access to network PCIe, typically an SR-IOV VF, but could also be a PF. Uses application specific driver contained in the image. The device is bound to a driver by the cloud provider which supports user space control by the application (e.g. vfio_pci, igb_uio). It is supported by the following CNIsTM: SRIOV, HOST-DEVICE.

"direct.kerneldriver": Similar to direct.userspace but device is bound to a kernel driver by the cloud provider and can be consumed in the same way as a kernel netdev. It is supported by the following CNIsTM: SRIOV, HOST-DEVICE.

"direct.bond": Based on the BOND CNITM. Requires the existence of a mated pair of direct kernel network attachments prior to the creation of the bond. Thus, when this interface type is indicated, three attachments definitions to the secondary container cluster network are expected: two providing the direct kerneldriver  functionality and one with the BOND CNITM

"userspace": Based on the userspace CNITM. requires infrastructure to support a DPDK-OVS or VPP based vSwitch.

Default value is "kernel.netdev".​

interfaceOption

M

0..N

Enum

vNIC configurations the network interface is verified to work with.

This attribute is applicable for interfaces of type "userspace".

Values:

"virtio"

"memif"

interfaceRedundancy

M

0..1

Enum

Method required from the infrastructure to provide redundancy for the interface.

Values:
"infraProvided", "left", "right", "activeActiveBond", "activePassiveBond",   "activePassivel3"

"infraProvided": The application sees one vNIC, but the infrastructure provides redundant access to the network via both switch planes. For interface of type kernel.netdev the redundancy is provided by the vSwitch or Linux bonding. For interfaces of type direct, it requires that the physical NIC is connected to both switch planes (a.k.a. smartNIC). Thus, it imposes hardware requirements on the infrastructure. For interface of type userspace redundancy handled by a DPDK-OVS or VPP vSwitch

"left" and "right": indicates a vNIC connected non-redundantly to the network via one specific (left or right) switchplane. Redundancy is implemented by having two external connection points, indicating different values (left/right) in the descriptor.

For the the following values, the infrastructure provides for a single external connection point  a mated vNIC pair in the Pod, one connecting to the network via left switchplane and the other connecting to the network via the right switchplane, and with the application using them together as a redundant network interface using a particular redundancy method that need to be accomodated in the node infrastructure:

"activeActiveBond": Requires a static multi-chassis LAG in active-active mode from the infrastructure. Typically corresponds to bonding mode-2 “balance-xor”

"activePassiveBond": The interfaces are bonded in active-passive mode in the application with move of bond MAC address. No specific requirements on DC fabric. Typically corresponds to bonding mode-1 “active-backup”

"activePassivel3": Application moves its IP address by attaching it to one of the two MACs by use of GARP messages.

6.6	ExtCpdParamMappings Information Element

The ExtCpdParamMappings IE describes required information on what parameters to be provided to the deployment tools for the ExtCpd instance.

Attribute

Qualifier

Cardinality

Content

Description

loadbalancerIP

M

0..1

String

When present, this attribute specifies the name of the deployment artifact input parameter through which the SMO can configure the loadbalancerIP parameter of the K8s service or ingress controller that the ExtCpd represents. See note 2.

externalIPs

M

0..1

String

When present, this attribute specifies the name of the deployment artifact input parameter through which the SMO can configure the externalIPs parameter of the K8s service or ingress controller, or the pod network interface annotation, that the ExtCpd represents. The param name and provided IP address(es) value will be passed to the deployment tool when deploying the DeploymentArtifacts. See note 2.

nadName

M

0..N

String

These attributes specify, for an ExtCpd representing a secondary network interface, the name(s) of the deployment artifact input parameter(s) through which the SMO can provide the names of the network attachment definitions (NADs) the SMO has created as base for the network interface the ExtCpd represents.
It is expected that the NADs themselves have been created prior to the deployment of the deployment artifacts. See notes 1, 2, and 3.

nadNamespace

M

0..1

String

Specifies, for an ExtCpd representing a secondary network interface, the name of the deployment artifact input parameter through which the SMO can provide the namespace where the NADs are located.
Attribute may be omitted if the namespace is same as the application namespace. See note 2.

NOTE 1: When the ExtCpd represent a networkRedundant/mated pair of sriov interfaces, there are references to 2 or 3 related NADs needed to be passed, while for other interface types only one NAD reference is needed to be passed.

NOTE 2: The format of the Content strings is specific for each different orchestration templating technology used (Helm, Teraform, etc.). Currently only a format for use with Helm charts is suggested: "<helmchartname>:[<subchartname>.] 0 ... N[<parentparamname>.] 0 … N<paramname>”. Whether the optional parts of the format are present depends on how the parameter is declared in the helm chart. An example is: "chartName:subChart1.subChart2.subChart3.Parent1.Parent2.Parent3.parameter".

NOTE 3:  A direct attached (passthrough) network interface, such as an sriov interface, attaches to a network via only one of the two switch planes in the infrastructure.

When using a direct attached network interface one therefore commonly in a pod uses a mated pair of sriov network attachments, where each interface attaches same network but via different switchplane.

The application uses the mated pair of network interfaces as a single logical “swith-path-redundant” network interface – and this is represented by a single ExtCpd.

Also, there is a case where a third “bond” attachment interface is used in the pod, bonding the two direct interfaces so that the application does not need to handle the redundancy issues – application just uses the bond interface.

In this case all three attachments are together making up a logical “switch-path-redundant” network interface represented by a single ExtCpd. When three NADs are used in the ExtCpd the NAD implementing the bond attachment interface is provided through the parameter indicated in the third place in the nadNames attribute.

6.7	EnhancedClusterCapabilities Information Element
