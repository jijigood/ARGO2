Table 5-1: Relationship between E2SM services and E2AP Information elements
All of these RAN Function specific IEs are defined in E2AP [3] as “OCTET STRING”.
The purpose of this specification is to define the contents of these fields for the specific RAN Function “KPM Monitor”.
6	RAN Function Service Model Description
6.1	RAN Function Overview
E2 Service Model KPM (E2SM-KPM) supports O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU as part of NG-RAN connected to 5GC or as part of E-UTRAN connected to EPC.
The E2 Node shall host the RAN Function “KPM Monitor” which performs the following functionalities:
-	Exposure of available measurements from O-DU, O-CU-CP, and/or O-CU-UP via the RAN Function Definition IE.
-	Periodic reporting of measurements subscribed from Near-RT RIC.
This E2SM specification also exposes a set of services described in clause 6.2.
6.2	Supported RIC Services
6.2.1	REPORT
The “KPM Monitor” RAN Function provides the following REPORT services:
-	E2 Node Measurement
-	E2 Node Measurement for a single UE
-	Condition-based, UE-level E2 Node Measurement
-	Common Condition-based, UE-level E2 Node Measurement
-	E2 Node Measurements for multiple UEs
These services may be initiated according to:
-	Periodical event.
7	RAN Function Description
7.1	Description
The E2AP [3] procedures, E2 SETUP and RIC SERVICE UPDATE, are used to transport the RAN Function Definition IE.
In this E2SM-KPM, the RAN Function Definition IE shall provide the following information:
-	RAN Function name along with associated information on E2SM definition
-	Event trigger styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.
-	RIC REPORT Service styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.
7.2	RAN Function Name
RAN Function Short Name “ORAN-E2SM-KPM”
RAN Function Description “KPM Monitor”
RAN Function Instance, required when and if an E2 Node exposes more than one instance of a RAN Function based on this E2SM.
7.3	Supported RIC Event Trigger Styles
7.3.1	Event Trigger Style Types
7.3.2	Event Trigger Style 1: Periodic Report
This Event Trigger style 1 is to set the KPM report period and uses the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE Format 1 (8.2.1.1.1)
7.4	Supported RIC REPORT Service Styles
7.4.1	REPORT Service Style Type
7.4.2	REPORT Service Style 1: E2 Node Measurement
7.4.2.1	REPORT Service Style description
The REPORT Service style 1 provides the performance measurement information collection from an E2 Node.
7.4.2.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents
This REPORT Service style aims to subscribe to the measurements defined in TS 28.552 [4] and TS 32.425 [8], and uses the RIC Action Definition IE Format 1 (8.2.1.2.1).
The REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contains measurement types that Near-RT RIC is requesting to subscribe followed by a list of subcounters to be measured for each measurement type, and a granularity period indicating collection interval of those measurements. For a certain measurement type to be subscribed, the Matching Condition for Reporting IE may also be included to give conditions for the E2 Node in reporting measurements, to report a measured value corresponding to that measurement type only when the value satisfies the given conditions.
For the measurement types that belong to a measurement object class confined in a single cell (e.g. "EUtranCellFDD" in TS 32.425 [8] or "NRCellDU" in TS 28.552 [4]), the Cell Global ID IE shall be included in the IE to point to a specific cell for collecting measurements within the E2 Node. The Cell Global ID IE may not be included if all the subscribed measurement types are cell agnostic, i.e. belonging to measurement object classes not confined in a single cell (e.g. "GNBCUUPFunction" in TS 28.552 [4]). In case that both single-cell-confined and cell agnostic measurement types are subscribed together, the Cell Global ID IE shall be included in the IE and the E2 Node shall ignore the included Cell Global ID IE for those cell agnostic measurement types.
A measurement ID can be used for subscription instead of a measurement type if an identifier of a certain measurement type was exposed by an E2 Node via the RAN Function Definition IE.
7.4.2.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (8.2.1.3.1), which contains a measurement collection start time as UTC format.
The REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE may carry file format version, sender name, sender type, and vendor name as printable strings.
7.4.2.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Message IE Format 1 (8.2.1.4.1).
The REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE carries a set of measurement data reported from an E2 Node. The reported data contains a set of measurement records, each collected at every granularity period during the reporting period. In case that the Matching Condition for Reporting IE has been configured in the RIC Action Definition IE for a measurement type and a measured value corresponding to that measurement type in a granularity period did not satisfy the configured reporting condition, the E2 Node shall indicate “Not Satisfied” instead of reporting the actual measured value within the measurement record corresponding to that granularity period. In case the configured reporting condition(s) are not satisfied entirely for a reporting period for all the subscribed measurement types, the E2 Node may omit sending the report for this reporting period. In case the E2 Node is not able to provide reliable data for a granularity period during the reporting period, it may include the optional Incomplete Flag IE, which indicates that the corresponding measurements record in the reported data is not reliable.
The REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE optionally carry subscription information, i.e. Measurement Information List IE that indicates the order of measured values for each measurement record in the reported data, or their granularity period. If not present, the original subscription information shall apply.
7.4.3	REPORT Service Style 2: E2 Node Measurement for a single UE
7.4.3.1	REPORT Service Style description
The REPORT Service style 2 provides the performance measurement information collection for a single UE of interest from an E2 Node.
7.4.3.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Action Definition IE Format 2 (8.2.1.2.2), where the included UE ID indicates a specific UE of interest for measurement collection.
The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.2.
7.4.3.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.
7.4.3.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Message IE Format 1 (8.2.1.4.1) as described in 7.4.2.4, where the measurement data reported is associated only to a specific UE that was subscribed.
7.4.4	REPORT Service Style 3: Condition-based, UE-level E2 Node Measurement
7.4.4.1	REPORT Service Style description
The REPORT Service style 3 provides the UE-level performance measurement information collection for a group of UEs per measurement type matching subscribed conditions from an E2 Node.
7.4.4.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Action Definition IE Format 3 (8.2.1.2.3), where, for each requested measurement within the Measurement Information Condition List IE, the Matching Condition IE serves as a condition to include the matched UEs’ measurement values into the reporting. The Matching Condition IE can be expressed by a list of subcounters to be measured (i.e. as a list of labels), or by a list of test conditions that need to be passed, or by a combination of both.
The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.2.
7.4.4.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.
7.4.4.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Message IE Format 2 (8.2.1.4.2).
The REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE carries a set of UE-level measurement data matching subscribed conditions. The included Measurement Information Condition UE List IE indicates the order of measured values for each measurement record in the reported data – a list of all the UE ID(s) satisfying the subscribed Matching Condition IE for each requested measurement within a Reporting Period.
In every granularity period during which a UE matching a subscribed condition stays in the E2 Node and maintains the  RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state, the E2 Node collects the related data and reports it at the end of the reporting period.
The List of matched UE IDs IE for a certain measurement type in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE indicates all the UE ID(s) that satisfied the subscribed Matching Condition IE for that measurement type and maintained the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state at least for one granularity period during the reporting period. The List of matched UE IDs IE can be omitted for a certain subscribed measurement type if none of the UEs were matched during the reporting period. If the List of matched UE IDs IE is used for a measurement type, then the same IE shall be used for all the measurement types in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE.
If the List of matched UE IDs IE is used, in the granularity periods where the UE does not appear in the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state (e.g. transitioned to RRC_IDLE or UE identity track is lost), the E2 Node does not collect the related data and NULL is reported for those granularity periods until the end of the Reporting Period. In this case, the E2 Node stops reporting measurements related to this UE in the subsequent reporting periods. If the List of matched UE IDs IE is used and a UE whose ID is included in the IE appeared in the middle of the reporting period, then NULL should be reported for the granularity periods priori to the UE appearing in the E2 Node.
On the other hand, the Sequence of Matched UE IDs for Granularity Periods IE for a certain measurement type in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE can be used to indicate the UE ID(s) that satisfied the subscribed Matching Condition IE for the corresponding measurement type and maintained the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state, separately for each and every granularity period in chronological order. If the Sequence of Matched UE IDs for Granularity Periods IE is used for a measurement type, then the same IE shall be used for all the measurement types in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE, and the List of matched UE IDs IE, if included for any measurement type, shall be ignored.
The rest of the information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.4.
7.4.5	REPORT Service Style 4: Common condition-based, UE-level Measurement
7.4.5.1	REPORT Service Style description
The REPORT Service style 4 provides the UE-level performance measurement information collection for a group of UEs across a set of measurement types matching common subscribed conditions from an E2 Node.
7.4.5.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Action Definition IE Format 4 (8.2.1.2.4), where a Matching Condition IE serves as a condition to include the matched UEs’ measurement values into the reporting, common for each requested measurement within the Measurement Information List IE. The Matching Condition IE is expressed by a list of test conditions to filter matching UEs.
The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.2.
7.4.5.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.
7.4.5.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents
This REPORT Service style uses the RIC Indication Message IE Format 3 (8.2.1.4.3).
The REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE Format 3 carries a list of measurement data for UE(s) matching subscribed conditions.
In every granularity period during which a UE matching a subscribed condition stays in the E2 Node and maintains the  RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state, the E2 Node collects the related data and reports it at the end of the reporting period. In the granularity periods where the UE does not appear in the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state (e.g. transitioned to RRC_IDLE or UE identity track is lost), the E2 Node does not collect the related data and NULL is reported for those granularity periods until the end of the Reporting Period. In this case, the E2 Node stops reporting measurements related to this UE in the subsequent reporting periods.
If none of the UEs were matched during the reporting period, then E2 Node does not report measurements for that reporting period.
The rest of the information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.4.
7.4.6	REPORT Service Style 5: E2 Node Measurement for Multiple UEs
7.4.6.1	REPORT Service Style description

8.3	Information Element definitions
8.3.1	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.
8.3.2	RAN Function Name

8.4	Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
8.4.1	General
E2SM-KPM ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [5] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [6].
Sub clause 8.4.2 presents the Abstract Syntax of the E2SM information elements to be carried within the E2AP [3] protocol messages with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 8.2 and 8.3, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
If an E2SM information element carried as an OCTET STRING in an E2AP [3] message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 9.

Annex A (normative or informative):
Further information on RAN Function Network KPM Monitor
A.1	Background Information
The RAN function “Key Performance Measurement” is used to provide RIC Service exposure of the performance measurement logical function of the E2 Nodes. Based on the O-RAN deployment architecture, available measurements could be different. Figure A.1-1 shows the target deployment architecture for E2SM-KPM.
Figure A.1-1 E2SM-KPM Architecture
For each logical function the E2 Node shall use the RAN Function Definition IE to declare the list of available measurements and a set of supported RIC Services (REPORT).
