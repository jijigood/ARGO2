Open Fronthaul Interface
C-plane
Introduction
The O-DU sends UL C-plane messages and DL C-plane messages to O-RU to trigger transmission and reception of RF signals. The DL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive DL I/Q data in U-plane messages from O-DU. Likewise, the UL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive RF signal and send UL I/Q data in U-plane messages to O-DU. Any delay of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard U-plane traffic from O-DU and the UE [31].
An adversary can inject its own DL C-plane or UL C-plane messages by spoofing the associated O-DU. As a result, it would block the O-RU from processing the corresponding U-Plane packets received from the O-DU and O-RU respectively, leading to temporary DoS and, limited cell performance on cells served by the O-RU [4]
Requirements
[REQ-SEC-OFCP-1] The C-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange C-plane messages with O-RUs.
Security Controls
Authentication and Authorization of network elements supporting the C-Plane
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-1 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of an O-DU and other network elements supporting the C-Plane within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.
U-plane
Requirements
Open Fronthaul U-plane transports 5G System Control Plane and User Plane messages between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.  The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [32] provides confidentiality and integrity protection of 5G System Control Plane and User Plane between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.
Security Controls
S-plane
Introduction
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks within a PTP network. Within a PTP domain [27], the grandmaster clock is the source of time to which all other PTP clocks in the domain are synchronized.
The IEEE 1588 standard specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the best clock from PTP Network and Local PTP Clock. The BMCA runs on PTP instances in the network continuously and is adjusting to changes in that network. PTP ANNOUNCE messages are used to build a timing distribution hierarchy with grandmaster at the top. There can be many grandmasters in PTP Network, but PTP Domain can have only one. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for providing timing to the PTP slave nodes.
Following the selection of the new grandmaster, the grandmaster begins transmitting the current time within the SYNC message and FOLLOW_UP messages if applicable. This allows the other clocks to synchronize their time to the grandmaster.
S-Plane attacks include an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization. Details are covered in Clause 5.4.1.2 of [4].
The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:
O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.
O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RU’s at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).
Requirements
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-1] The S-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.
NOTE: This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane where authenticated and authorized PTP nodes communicate over the Open Fronthaul network.
NOTE: There is no specific requirement for authentication and authorization mechanism of S-plane PTP messages.
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-2] The S-Plane should provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-3] For the O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model the S-Plane should protect against MITM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [28].
Security Controls
Synchronization Architecture Redundancy
This clause addresses requirement REQ-SEC-OFSP-3 by providing an architectural recommendation to S-plane security based on redundancy in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into to the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-1: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support simultaneous Grandmasters.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-2: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.
O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [30] Clause 8.2.3 Timing/Synchronization Redundancy & Resiliency provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
Authentication and Authorization of PTP nodes
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFSP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFSP-2 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

Open Fronthaul Point-to-Point LAN Segment
The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. These are also known as point-to-point LAN segments [12]. Each end of the Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segment comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, as described in [13] and [14].
EXAMPLE: Physical O-RAN network elements includes O-DU, O-RU
An Open Fronthaul network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Xhaul Transport Network Elements that share a point-to-point LAN segment with Open Fronthaul network elements are also Open Fronthaul network elements. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, TNE and PRTC-T/GM [13][14][15][26].

Security Control
Solution #1: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1x Port based Network Access Control
IEEE 802.1X-2020 is optional to support.
NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.
IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network. Port-based network access control in the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprises supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12]  and as further described in this clause. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification and are determined by vendor implementation in agreement with operator-specific requirements.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-1: Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.
Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-2: Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 supplicant functionality [12] for each port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.
Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-3: Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-4: An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based network access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-5: Port-based network access control between a supplicant and authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall use EAP TLS authentication as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
O-DU as an Authenticator
Configuration LLS-C1 [13] and Cascade Mode in the Shared Cell Concept [12] are cases where an O-DU and O-RU are Open Fronthaul network elements in a point-to-point LAN segment.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-6: In the case of Configuration LLS-C1, the O-DU must support the authenticator functionality as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
Authenticator interface to an Authentication Server in the Open Fronthaul Network
IEEE 802.1x describes an EAP-TLS exchange which includes an interface between an authenticator and authentication server. [12]
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-7: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server shall support IETF RADIUS standards, IETF RFC 2865[22], IETF RFC 2866[23], IETF RFC 3579[24], and successor standards.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-8: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server should support IETF Diameter standards, IETF RFC 4072 [25] and successor standards.
NOTE: Mechanisms to secure the interface between the authenticator and authentication server are out of scope of the O-RAN Alliance.
Authentication and authorization procedure for 802.1x Port based Network Access Control
.
General requirements
Only those Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant that have mutually authenticated with an authenticator are authorized to participate in the Open Fronthaul network. If an authenticator port is to be activated in the Open Fronthaul, then the authenticator places the port into an unauthorized state that allows EAP over LAN (EAPOL) packets for EAP authentication and blocks all other traffic. If the mutual authentication has been successful and the operator authorizes operation for the network element port, then the port is switched to the authorized state whereby non-EAPOL packets can be sent and received.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-9: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator shall place each of its unauthorized ports into a state that allows EAPOL traffic and block all other Ethernet traffic.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-10: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator should be able to implement authorization policies that apply to its authorized ports. Authorization policies may include tagging authorized traffic with a particular VLAN-ID as it egresses the Open Fronthaul network element and/or enforcing access control policies that restrict the type of traffic able to be forwarded by the Open Fronthaul network element.
Manufacturer Install Certificates
This clause applies to the Extensible Authentication Protocol as defined in IEEE 802.1X [12].  where such an approachis used. A supplicant implements an EAP method according to its supported credentials. Prior to a supplicant enrolling in an operator’s PKI, a manufacturer installed certificate shall be used together with an EAP-TLS dialogue to enable certificate-based mutual authentication to be performed between an authenticator and a supplicant.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-11: The O-RU shall have installed a Manufacturer Installed X.509 Certificate.
Security Procedure
The following procedure describes the authentication and authorization, based on IEEE 802.1 Port based Network Access Control, of point-to-point LAN segments between a supplicant and another Open Fronthaul network element acting as an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-12: The normal operation procedure defined in IEEE 802.1x [12]  shown in Figure 5-2shall be performed to authenticate and authorize an O-RU within an Open Fronthaul network.

SBOM Guidelines for O-RAN
SBOM Overview
This clause provides guidance for generation, delivery, and use of a software bill of materials (SBOM).
SBOM is a fundamental component of a mature Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SBOM is an industry best practice part of secure software development that enhances the understanding of the upstream software supply chain so that vulnerability notifications and updates can be properly and safely handled across the installed customer base.   The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) define SBOM as “a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.” The DoC, in coordination with NTIA, published a report “The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)” [17] that provides guidance on the data fields, automation, and processes to be used by suppliers and customers.  The SBOM documents proprietary and third-party software, including commercial and free and open-source software (FOSS), used in software products.  The SBOM is maintained and used by the software supplier and stored and viewed by the network operator.

SBOM Requirements for O-RAN
The SBOM delivery should be made under contractual agreement with specific terms that include the following   requirements and controls.
Requirements
REQ-SBOM-001: The O-RAN vendor shall provide the SBOM with every O-RAN software delivery package, including patches.
REQ-SBOM-002: The minimum set of data fields shall include: Supplier Name, Component Name, Version of the Component, Other Unique Identifiers as available, Dependency Relationship, Author of the SBOM data, and Timestamp [17].
REQ-SBOM-003: Vulnerabilities shall not be included as an additional data field because it would represent a static view from a specific point in time, while vulnerabilities are constantly evolving.
NOTE: The SBOM should be used by vendors and operators to periodically check against known vulnerability databases to identify potential risk.
NOTE: The level of risk for a vulnerability should be determined by the software vendor and operator with consideration of the software product, use case, and network environment.
NOTE: The SBOM provides visibility into the use of open-source and third-party provided software having known vulnerabilities or contributions from individuals or companies in adversarial nations, but it does not protect against zero-day vulnerabilities that were unintentionally or maliciously inserted, exploited, or discovered and not reported.
REQ-SBOM-004: SBOM Depth shall be provided at top-level.
REQ-SBOM-005: SBOM depth shall be provided to a second-level for O-RAN Software Community (OSC) sourced software to indicate which OSC modules are used and which individual and/or company contributed the software for that module.
REQ-SBOM-006: SBOM depth shall be provided to second-level for any used open source software.
REQ-SBOM-007: SBOM shall be authenticity and integrity protected when in transit and at rest.
REQ-SBOM-008:  Commercial software vendors using software from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) shall provide an SBOM that includes the components used from the OSC.
REQ-SBOM-009:  SBOM for commercial software shall be access controlled.
REQ-SBOM-010:  The consumer of an SBOM shall maintain confidentiality protection on the SBOM delivered from the SBOM producer.
NOTE: As stated in the DoC/NTIA report [17], “…some have raised concerns that adversaries could take advantage and target those critical components for novel attacks. Further research is necessary to understand the optimal structure and incentives for sharing, protecting, and using SBOM data."
REQ-SBOM-011: The SBOM shall be provided in Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [18], CycloneDX [19], or Software Identification (SWID) [20] format.
NOTE: ISO/IEC 5962:2021[21] - Information technology — SPDX® Specification V2.2.1, published August 2021, specifies SPDX as a standard data format for communicating the component and metadata information associated with SBOM.
Security Controls
SEC-CTL-SBOM-001: For integrity, a hash shall be generated for the SBOM, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specification [3], clause 5.
SEC-CTL-SBOM-002: For authenticity, a digital signature shall be provided for the SBOM, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specification [3], clause 5.

Guidance on Security Requirements & Controls
C.1 O-Cloud
Controls given in this clause are designed as a guidance and non-normative. The implementation of those non-normative controls depends on the security policies within the O-Cloud Service Provider, O-RAN  Application Provider  and Service Provider.
C.1.1 Secure storage of cryptographic keys and sensitive data
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-1
The following potential implementation options for encrypting cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the O-Cloud platform could be used. The appropriate option to be used depends on the sensitivity of the data to be protected and needs to be assessed/determined by the Service provider.
Software based:
Software-based KMS vaults supporting management of keys, including creation, rotation, and revocation, as well as encrypting and decrypting sensitive data with managed keys [51].
Use a vTPM: A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) is a software-based representation of a physical Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip to provide secure storage of credentials or keys [54]. A vTPM acts as any other virtual device. It performs the same functions as a TPM, but it performs cryptographic coprocessor capabilities in software. It should comply with the TPM 2.0 specification [53].
Hardware based
Hardware-based key vaults: The use of Key Management Service (KMS) based on an HSM [i.5], [i.6], [52]. The data is encrypted using a data encryption key (DEK); a new DEK is generated for each encryption. The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) that is stored and managed in the HSM of the KMS provider.
A hardware TPM [i.8], [53]. For data encryption, an encryption key is stored on disk but encrypted with the TPM master key (the storage root key (SRK)). This encryption key can only be used after it was decrypted by an authenticated TPM. The actual data encryption/decryption is then done by the main CPU, only decryption/encryption of the encryption key is done inside the TPM.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-2
Overwriting with zero (e.g., /dev/zero) or simple patterns.
Overwriting with random data using:
True random data source (e.g., /dev/random). This solution takes too long to wait for the entropy generation.
Pseudorandom data source (e.g., /dev/urandom) can be used as a reasonable source of pseudorandom data.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-3
Each data center adheres to a strict disposal policy and uses the techniques described to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 “Guidelines for Media Sanitization” [75] and DoD 5220.22-M “National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.” [50].
C.1.2 Chain of Trust
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1
There are many ways to measure platform integrity. In many cases, a hardware security module is used to store measurement data such as a HSM and TPM. Various platform integrity technologies build their own CoTs [i.7] and listed here below:
UEFI Secure Boot (SB)
Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)
Intel Boot Guard
Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR)
Intel Technology Example Summary
AMD Platform Secure Boot (AMD PSB)
Arm TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for Armv8-A
Arm Secure Boot and the Chain of Trust (CoT)
Cisco Platform Roots of Trust
IBM Chain of Trust (CoT)
For more details, see [i.7], clause 3.2.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2
A vTPM can be considered a software-based implementation of a root of trust. It emulates the behavior and functionalities of a physical TPM through software mechanisms and cryptographic libraries [53], [54]. A vTPM operates within a virtual machine or as a software module within an operating system, leveraging the underlying hardware and security features provided by the host system. It can perform key generation, storage, and cryptographic operations similar to a physical TPM. However, since it is implemented in software, its security relies on the host system's security measures and may be more vulnerable to compromise if the host system is compromised. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the overall security of the O-Cloud where the vTPM is deployed and to consider additional security measures to protect the software root of trust.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-3
Please refer to the following technology examples in [i.7], clause 6.1 for more information:
Intel Security Libraries for the Data Center (ISecL-DC)
Remote AS - Project Veraison (VERificAtIon of atteStatiON)
IBM Platform Attestation Tooling
Relevant information on the AS is provided in [i.7], clause 6.1 and [44], clause 6.6.
The following figure shows an example of remote AS:
The AS from the hardware layer to the O-RAN Application includes the following steps (see figure):
Attestation of the O-Cloud platform
RoT measures and verifies hardware resources (server platform) including firmware/BIOS. It then launches the hardware resources.
The server act as the attester of the OS/virtualization layer. It measures, verifies and launches the OS/virtualization layer.
The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by the management platform (e.g. Kubernetes) acting as the trust agent.
Attestation of Application
The attestation process is initiated by the management platform requesting to instantiate a new Application:
The virtualization layer verifies the virtual instance.
Virtualized RoT (vRoT) measures the Application. The vRoT is a virtual instance associated to the hardware protected RoT. The virtualization layer provides this virtual resource to the virtual instance.
Corresponding measurements are reported to the trust agent. The trust agent exposes the attestation results to authorized attestation server (could be within the SMO) so that it verifies collected measurements against trust policies already defined by administrators.
C.2 Common Application Lifecycle Management
C.2.1 Software Package Protection
Potential controls on REQ-SEC-ALM-PKG-1 and REQ-SEC-ALM-PKG-4
Application packages need to be frequently tested throughout the lifecycle of the Application:
Tools used for static code and dynamic security analysis, analysis of code being released, and penetration test results must be shared with the Service Provider.
