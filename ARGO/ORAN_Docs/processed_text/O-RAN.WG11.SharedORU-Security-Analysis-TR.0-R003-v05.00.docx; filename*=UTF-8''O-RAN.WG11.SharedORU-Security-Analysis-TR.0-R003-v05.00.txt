Scope

This technical report provides the threat model and risk assessment for the Shared O-RU.  The report identifies threats and risks and recommends potential security controls to protect against those threats through safeguards or mitigation.

The steps of the threat modelling process are as follows:

Identify assets: Identify the assets of the Shared O-RU that must be protected.

Identify threats: Identify the threats that could adversely impact the Shared O-RU and threats that can use the Shared O-RU to adversely impact other components of the O-RAN system.

Identify the attack surface and attack vectors: Identify the points in the Shared O-RU where an attacker could

gain entry to a O-RU Host or O-RU Tenant (SRO) of a Shared O-RU

gain entry to another O-RAN component through the Shared O-RU

exploit a vulnerability or misconfiguration at the Shared O-RU

compromise the Shared O-RU to degrade performance or impact availability

expose data at rest / data in use at the Shared O-RU

expose data in motion between the Shared O-RU and other O-RAN network functions

Measure risk: The extent to which confidentiality, integrity, or availability is threatened, based upon a risk-based analysis considering the impact level resulting from an attack and the likelihood of occurrence.

Recommend controls: The management, operational, and technical controls for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Shared O-RU and its information.

The sections in this Shared O-RU Security Analysis Technical Report (TR) follow the process described above.

This Technical Report makes the following considerations:

The attack surface of the Shared O-RU includes assets that are interfaces, functions, and data.

Data-at-rest, Data-in-motion, and Data-in-use must be considered.

O-RAN Alliance WG4 is in the process of defining optional architectures for Shared O-RU.  This will influence the set of assets to be protected.

The O-RAN Alliance is pursuing a zero-trust architecture (ZTA) for its specifications based upon NIST SP 800-207 [8].  This will affect the risk scoring as external and internal threats are considered.

Security controls will be recommended for specifications of the Shared O-RU.  The recommended controls provided in this report will be shared with the responsible O-RAN Alliance working group, such as WG1 and WG4, so that the appropriate specification relevant to the recommendation can be updated.

Some of the identified Shared O-RU assets may already be in scope for of other ongoing WG11 security work items.  The Shared O-RU Security Analysis Technical Report work item may inform those work items.

Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions apply:

Terms

This document uses the verbal forms for the expression of provisions as defined in O-RAN Document Drafting Rules (ODR)[1].

This document uses the term Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as defined by US NIST in [8] and applied to 5G cloud deployments by US CISA in [9].  A ZTA provides protection from external and internal threats, assuming the following:

there is no implicit trust granted to an asset based upon ownership, physical location, or network location [8].

the adversary is already inside the network. Perimeter defenses are no longer sufficient to secure a network, and there should always be an assumption that a threat actor has established a foothold in the network [9].

This document uses the term “attack surface” defined by US NIST as

The set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from, that system, system element, or environment. [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/attack_surface]

This document refers to “sensitive information” defined by US NIST as

information whose loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or modification could adversely affect security. [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/sensitive]

Shared O-RU Assets

Architecture

The potential benefits of Shared O-RU are RAN Sharing, Neutral Host, high RAN reliability (redundancy) and RAN processing pooling.  Shared O-RU involves cooperation with the SMO, O-CU, O-DU, and O-RU network.  Securing the Shared O-RU is imperative to protect the O-RAN deployment and each of its tenants.  Five optional configurations are being considered for Shared O-RU [3] and while there are common security risks, each configuration may also introduce unique security risks.  The Attack Surface of the Shared O-RU includes assets groups Functions, Interfaces, and Information, which each have assets that should be protected. The assets that should be protected are listed in the following sections.

Figure 4.1-1 shows the Shared O-RU building blocks and protocol stack.

Figure 4.1-1: Shared O-RU Tenant/Host Split

The following points are considered:

The Shared O-RU can be receiving data via a single/shared physical port. This connectivity is used to transfer tenant and host-specific controller functionality.

The tenant/host-split point is the earliest point in the protocol stack when host and tenants are going to be separated/isolated.

Each of the tenants can obtain access (i.e., read/write) to its own resources, and a tenant has no means to access neighbor resources.

The host can obtain access (i.e., read/write) to common M-plane resources.

The user will be authenticated by using username and password/certificate and in case of netconf/ssh by using public/private key. In successful case the user is obtaining authorization on Module Level. Access control management (ACM) functionality required on that protocol level.

Every tenant who is requesting access to ‘own’= tenant specific resources, needs to be identified using its unique SRO-Id, and after successful authentication, the tenant will be authorized to access its own resources.

Functions

The following functions should be considered in the Shared O-RU risk analysis:

ASSET-C-31: Shared O-RU

ASSET-C-32: O-RU Host

ASSET-C-33: O-RU Tenant (Shared Resource Operator)

ASSET-C-34: O-DU Host

ASSET-C-35: O-DU Tenant (Shared Resource Operator)

ASSET-C-36: O-CU Host, includes O-CU-CP and O-CU-CP software

ASSET-C-37: O-CU Tenant (Shared Resource Operator), includes O-CU-CP and O-CU-CP software

ASSET-C-38: SMO Host (Shared Operator Host)

ASSET-C-39: SMO Tenant (Shared Resource Operator)

Neutral Host Controller (NHC)

NOTE:  NHC is not an agreed upon function in the O-RAN architecture

Figures 4.2-1, 4.2-2, and 4.2-3 below show these assets in Shared O-RU architecture.

ASSET-C-22: O1

ASSET-C-24: OFH M-Plane: OAM Config and Carrier Config

New interfaces for Shared O-RU currently in specifications development will be considered in a later phase of the security analysis.  This includes Fast Dynamic Scheduling between Host and Tenant O-DUs and Slow Dynamic Scheduling between Host and Tenant SMOs.

Threats

Threat Model

The STRIDE model is used to classify threats:

S - Spoofing identity. An application or program can masquerade as another to gain advantages not typically allowed for that program.

T - Tampering with data. This involves the malicious modification of data, including making unauthorized changes to a database and alteration of data as it flows between computers.

R - Repudiation. A user or program refuses the authenticity of a good or reasonable command or action.

I - Information disclosure. This involves the exposure of information to individuals with unauthorized access to it. For example, users gain the ability to read a file that they normally would not have been granted access to, or an intruder can read data in transit between computers.

D - Denial of service. These attacks deny service to valid users, such as making a website unavailable or unusable by flooding it with illegitimate requests to keep legitimate users without access.

E - Elevation of privileges. An unauthorized user gains privileged rights to access previously no granted to compromise or destroy the system, such as a change in membership.

Shared O-RU Threats

The security risks associated with the Shared O-RU are due to:

1. resource sharing in a multi-tenant environment

2. interworking between host and tenant network functions

3. interfaces between Shared O-RU and other O-RAN functions

The Shared O-RU threat analysis considers the threats listed in clause 5.3 that are relevant to O-RAN and Shared O-RU.  The following threats to Shared O-RU have been identified and will be analyzed in clause 6 – Threat Analysis.

Threats due to Multi-Tenancy

O-DU Host access to O-DU Tenant through Shared O-RU

O-DU Tenant access to O-DU Host through Shared O-RU

SMO Host access to SMO Tenant

SMO Tenant access to SMO Host

Threats at Shared O-RU functions

Parameter conflicts at Shared O-RU

Privilege levels for authorization to data and processes in O-RU, O-DU, and SMO

Escalation of privilege at NHC

Threats to Shared O-RU interfaces

Untrusted peering between Shared O-RU and O-DU

Insecure APIs

Message flooding

Threat Analysis

Threat Analysis tables are provided for each of the identified Shared O-RU threats in the subsections below. The Shared O-RU Threats are classified into the following 7 threat groups:

Lateral Movement Between Network Functions

User Access Threats

Data Access Threats

Availability Threats

Configuration Threats

Neutral Host Controller Threats

Resiliency

Table 6-1 summarizes the identified threats for each of the Shared O-RU threat groups.  The threat analysis considers a zero trust architecture (ZTA) for which (i) micro-perimeters are established for each asset and (ii) there is no implicit trust granted to assets or users [8].  Shared O-RU assets, as discussed in the Functions, Interfaces, and Information asset groups in clause 4- Assets, are considered for the threat analysis. The threat analysis was performed on the five architectural options being considered for deployment of Shared O-RU [3], which allow use of M-Plane Hybrid or Hierarchical mode and optional use of a Neutral Host Controller (NHC).

Table 6-1 summarizes the identified threats for each of the Shared O-RU threat groups.  This may not be an exhaustive list and may be expanded in future versions of this Technical Report.

Use of the term “MNO Tenant” or “Tenant” refers to a “Shared Resource Operator (SRO)” as defined in O-RAN ALLIANCE TS: "Management Plane Specification.[20].

Risk Assessment

This section provides risk assessment tables for each of the identified assets.  These tables list the assets, threats, impacts, and possible security controls.

A malicious actor may be a nation-state adversary, cybercriminal, or employee.  In a ZTA, perimeter defenses alone are insufficient.  O-RAN deployments, including Shared O-RU, must be protected from untrusted external sources attempting to have access, while also assuming internal threat actors are inside the network with access to its functions and data.  Security controls for a ZTA, protecting against external and internal threats, should be implemented through a risk-based approach.  A risk analysis calculates risk levels by assessing the threat’s Likelihood of attack and the Impact from the attack.  External and internal threats are from the perspective of the O-RAN architecture.  External Threats are external to the O-RAN and Internal Threats are internal to O-RAN.

Impact scores can be lowered with consideration of existing security controls.  Impact scoring is based upon current security controls.  Impact scoring does not consider security controls that may be potentially specified in the future.

Likelihood scores may be higher when the goal is a ZTA, because external and internal threats must be considered.  When likelihood scoring during a risk analysis, it is necessary to consider internal threats performing reconnaissance attacks impacting confidentiality and privacy and attacks causing damage or degrading performance impacting availability.  Internal threat actors are less likely to perform damaging attacks that are quickly and easily detected and blocked, but more likely to attempt reconnaissance attacks to collect information.  As a result, reconnaissance type attacks can be scored Likelihood = High while damaging/availability attacks can be scored Likelihood = Medium or Low.

A risk analysis of the Shared O-RU threats is provided in the tables below.  A security best practice is to periodically repeat the risk analysis to consider evolving threats and security controls, which may produce an adjusted risk score based upon Impact and Likelihood.

Primary Security Issues

The security analysis described in the document has identified the following issues:

New interfaces currently in specifications development process are out of scope in WG11 until further progress is made on the specifications in WG4.  These interfaces are Fast Dynamic Scheduling between Host and Tenant O-DUs and Slow Dynamic Scheduling between Host and Tenant SMOs.

At this time, Neutral Host Controller (NHC) is not included in the O-RAN architecture, as specified in [2].  Security analysis of the NHC may need to be performed again depending upon decisions made by WG1 and WG4. This work item will form normative requirements for the NHC only when WG1 has officially added the NHC to the O-RAN architecture.  Until that time there will be no update via CR to add NHC to the following documents:

O-RAN Security Requirements Specification [5]

O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and Remediation Analysis [6]

O-RAN Security Test Specification [7]

Recommendations

The security analysis described in the document has produced the following recommendations:

ZTA requires confidentiality, integrity, and availability protection for network functions and internal interfaces used in the Shared O-RU architecture.  Critical security controls for Shared O-RU to comply with a ZTA are:

mTLS for authentication

OAuth 2.0 for authorization

TLS for data in transit

Encrypt data at rest

MFA for human user login

Logging with tenant-awareness

Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) for human users to access data

Open Fronthaul specification currently allows password-based authentication [20].  PKI-based X.509 certificates is recommended for machine-to-machine authentication in a Shared O-RU multi-tenant environment.  If SSH is used then asymmetric keys should be used instead of password.

In a multi-tenant environment, 802.1X will enforce port-based network access control on all Shared O-RU ethernet-based management interfaces and ethernet-based network interfaces.  WG11 should address 802.1X requirements for Shared O-RU with relevant working groups, including WG1, WG4, WG5, and WG6.

Shared O-RU is at risk of conflicting parameters from Host and Tenant (SRO).  Conflict mitigation should be implemented.  The mechanism for handling conflicting parameters is specified in clause 19.11 “Partitioning of shared O-RU carrier resources” of the O-RAN Open Fronthaul M-Plane specification [20]. This clause identifies common Shared O-RU resources shared across tenants, also called SROs, and defines the expectation that logic for resolving conflicting configuration logic resides outside of Shared O-RU. This was based on WG4 technical evaluation of proposals that concluded the O-RU is not the preferred place for resolving conflicting configuration.

Tenant isolation should be implemented for Host and Tenants having co-located resources and/or sharing resources. Tenant isolation for Shared O-RU is addressed in clauses 19.3.1, 19.3.3, and 19.6.1 of the O-RAN Open Fronthaul M-Plane specification [20]. These clauses introduce new access privilege groups for NETCONF clients that share the O-RU and define how the ‘carrier’ access privilege is used in the context of carrier management on the Open Fronthaul. Each tenant, also called SRO, user account is associated with a sro-id and ‘carrier’ access privilege.

Annex A:	Shared O-RU All-in-One Architecture

This section describes the concept of a Shared O-RU architecture as shown in Figure A.1-1.  The “All-in-One” architecture represents a single deployment scenario. The Shared O-RU is connected to one or more tenants, while one tenant takes over the host role.

Figure A.11  Shared O-RU ’All-in-One’ Architecture (overview)

The following points are considered for the All-in-One architecture:

The separation of Host and Tenant refers to the multi-MNO deployment scenario, while a merging of both network functions is referring to the single-MNO deployment.

The Neutral Host Controller is interfaced via a ‘common M-plane’ to O-RU Netconf Server, and the O-DU (host/tenant) is interfaced via a ‘Carrier Configuration’ to the O-RU Netconf Server.

The common Netconf client functionality can be embedded either inside O-DU network function or can be placed in an external entity namely neutral host controller (NHC). Anyway, for both deployments the common Netconf client is interfaced to the server via a common M-plane, while the Netconf client is interfaced to the Netconf server for carrier configuration purposes.

The neutral host controller (NHC) is assumed to be inside an ‘untrusted ORAN’, while the O-RAN specific entities are residing inside the ‘trusted ORAN’. The separation of ‘trusted’ and ‘untrusted’ O-RAN is creating additional threat vectors.

Figure A.1-2 shows a simplified view of the ‘All-in-One’ architecture.  The following points about “host” and “tenant” is considered:

The shared O-RU is at the same time interfaces to a host and to a tenant. The term ‘host’ refers to all entities which include host specific functionalities, e.g., Neutral Host Controller or SMO host etc. The term ‘tenant’ refers to all entities which include tenant specific functionalities.

Both, the host, and the tenant, support a CUS-plane interface, and both support the carrier configuration function via the O-FH M-plane interface. These can be regarded as basic functions of a tenant.

The host is supporting the common M-plane which is transferred over the O-FH M-plane interface. This is a specific function provided by the host.

For the shared O-RU the concurrent support of a ‘host’ and ‘tenant’ is required, and therefore needs to be considered for security.
