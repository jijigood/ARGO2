4	General aspects

4.1	D2 interface general principles

The general principles for the specification of the D2 interface are as follows:

the D2 interface is open;

the D2 interface supports the exchange of signalling information between the endpoints. In addition the interface supports data transmission to the respective endpoints;

the D2 is a point-to-point interface between the endpoints on two O-DUs. A point-to-point logical interface should be feasible even in the absence of a physical direct connection between the two O-DUs.

the D2 interface supports control plane(D2-c)  and user plane (D2-u) separation;

the D2 interface enables exchange of UE associated information and non-UE associated information;

the D2 interface is designed in a future proof way to fulfil new requirements, and services;

the D2 interface supports NR carrier aggregation of carriers configured in different O-DU nodes. The schedulers in the O-DUs operate independently of each other.

4.2	D2 interface within O-RAN architecture

O-DUs can be interconnected by the D2 interface. Figure 4.21 shows the D2 interface in the O-RAN WG1.OAD Figure 5.1-2 [1]. In the present document, O-DUs interconnected by the D2 interface are connected to a single O-CU-CP as shown in Figure 4.21.

NOTE:	O-DUs interconnected by the D2 interface can be connected to different O-CU-UP. Figure 4.21 shows the connection between O-DUs connected to a single O-CU-CP.

Figure 4.21: D2 Interface for Intra CU inter DU carrier aggregation

The D2 interface is a logical interface connecting two O-DUs for supporting inter O-DU carrier aggregation. A pair of O-DUs can be connected with each other by the D2 interface.

F1 (F1-c, F1-u) and E1 are logical 3GPP interfaces, whose protocols, termination points and cardinalities are specified in 3GPP TS 38.401 [6]. Open FH is O-RAN defined interface as specified in O-RAN WG4.CUS [3].

Using D2 interface, the O-DUs are able to exchange user data and control information to support inter O-DU carrier aggregation. Configuration for establishment and functioning of D2 interface ( for example  peer O-DU IP address, C-RNTI etc) is provided to O-DU by SMO over O1 interface, or by other means such as local node configuration.

4.3	Functional split for PCell O-DU and SCell O-DU

The functional split in the PCell and SCell O-DU for supporting inter O-DU CA is as follows:

The user data and control information message exchange take place at MAC level.

Single RLC per UE resides in the PCell O-DU as shown in Figure 4.31.

For supporting DL CA using D2 interface PUCCH allocation and reception of PUCCH data from UE is performed by the PCell O-DU for both PCell and SCells. The PCell O-DU shares the received information with the SCell O-DU as shown in Figure 4.31

Figure 4.31:User Data exchange for inter O-DU DL CA (PUSCH not shown)

4.4	D2 interface specification objectives

The D2 interface specifications facilitate the following:

inter connection between two O-DUs.

inter O-DU carrier aggregation by exchanging user and control information between O-DUs.

4.5	D2 interface capabilities

The D2 interface supports:

procedures to establish, maintain and release D2 connection between two O-DUs.

procedures to establish, maintain and release D2 context for storing the UE information across O-DUs for supporting inter O-DU CA.

procedures to exchange user data and control data across O-DUs to support the inter O-DU CA.

5	Functions of the D2 interface

5.1 	General

The D2 interface provides connectivity between O-DUs to facilitate inter O-DU carrier aggregation. Its functionality is divided into two parts: control plane (D2-c) and user plane(D2-u). The following clauses describe the functions supported over D2-c and D2-u.

5.2	D2-c function

5.2.1	Interface management function

The D2 setup function allows for the initial setup of a D2 connection between two O-DUs, including exchange of the cell-level data. Configuration of the D2 interface endpoints can be managed by the SMO to O-DU via the O1 interface. D2 configuration can also be provided through node specific O&M systems. The D2 setup can be initiated by any O-DU that successfully completes the cell setup procedure. During this process, both the originating and destined O-DUs share cell capabilities, for example sub-carrier spacing, duplexing methods, and TDD DL-UL configurations etc.

Once the D2 connection is established, any changes in the cells supported by an O-DU such as a cell being locked, cell unlocked, overloaded or any other change will be communicated to its peer O-DU using the D2 Configuration Update procedure. This procedure allows the two O-DUs to notify each other about changes in their cell status. If cell status is locked or disabled, context for all the UEs in that SCell will be released.

D2 release functions is used to remove the D2 connection between the two O-DUs. All the related resources between the two O-DUs will be cleared in controlled manner.

The error indication function is used by the O-DU to indicate to the peer O-DU that an error has occurred. For example, if parsing of D2 Configuration Update Acknowledge or D2 Setup Response fails, O-DU can inform the peer O-DU about the same using error indication function.

 Figure 5.2.11 shows the interface management functions.

Figure 5.2.11: Interface Management Function

5.2.2	UE management function

The UE management function supports the establishment and modification of D2 context for SCells for a UE. These functions include establishment, modification and release of the SCells in PCell and SCell O-DUs. The procedures include addition, deletion, modification of a SCell for a UE in the O-DUs.

The establishment of UE Addition is initiated by the PCell O-DU. It is accepted or rejected by the SCell O-DU based on the admission control criteria for example resource availability, loading etc. After reception of successful addition response for the UE from the SCell O-DU, the PCell O-DU sends UE Context Setup/Modification response to O-CU-CP. RRC Reconfiguration procedure is triggered towards UE for SCell addition. On reception of RRC Reconfiguration Complete from UE, the PCell O-DU sends the UE Reconfiguration Completion message to the SCell O-DU.

The modification of SCell configuration for a UE is initiated by the	 PCell O-DU. If an SCell for a UE already configured in the SCell O-DU, PCell O-DU can use modification procedure to add another SCell. The modification procedure is also used by the PCell O-DU to update any of the configuration parameters for example change of security key, UL configuration, DRX cycle, change of measurement gap, PDU session add/rel/mod (QoS flow add/rel, 5QI Change), DRB etc in the SCell O-DU. If multiple SCells are added between the two O-DUs for a UE, this procedure can also be used to release some of the SCells.

The UE deletion procedure for a UE is initiated by the PCell O-DU. This procedure can be used if UE is released in the PCell O-DU or all the SCells are deleted for a UE between the two O-DUs. The UE information for the SCell is cleared in the SCell O-DU.

The modification required procedure is initiated by the SCell O-DU to request the release of SCell(s) for a UE. This can be triggered due to any scenario taking place in SCell O-DU for example overloading, or cell lock or cell down. The PCell O-DU removes the SCell reference for the UE for which the message is received. The PCell O-DU responds back with confirm message after successful deletion of SCells. The SCell O-DU will clear the SCell(s) for the UE after completion of this procedure.

Figure 5.2.21 captures the UE management functions.

5.3	D2-u function

5.3.1	D2-u General Principles

The following principles apply to D2-u for inter O-DU DL carrier aggregation.

The PCell O-DU requests the SCell O-DU to schedule data for the UE indicating a range of time slots, where data can be scheduled by the SCell O-DU. The range is configurable.

HARQ retransmission is executed in the same node where the first transmission was executed. The decision for when retransmission is to be executed is FFS.

CSI-RS transmission for a UE that is added by D2 interface is triggered when an SCell is added for the UE.

5.3.2	Transfer of User Data

These functions allow the exchange of user data, scheduling related information (range of slots) and associated control information between PCell O-DU and SCell O-DU for supporting inter O-DU carrier aggregation.

To facilitate inter O-DU CA, PCell O-DU shares data size that can be scheduled in SCell O-DU. It also indicates the range of slots where UE can be scheduled in SCell O-DU. Pcell O-DU can also provide the CSI information to the SCell O-DU. SCell O-DU, if it can schedule the UE, responds back with the scheduled data size and PDCCH slot timing to obtain the user data and PUCCH resources from PCell O-DU. PCell O-DU, based on the PDCCH timing information, sends the allocated PUCCH resources such as K1 ( PDSCH to Ack/Nack timing) and DAI to SCell O-DU. In case of PUCCH resource allocation failure or unavailability of data, PCell O-DU sends the failure to SCell O-DU.

The data transfer function allows the transfer of user data between O-DU to support Inter O-DU carrier aggregation. For DL CA, PCell O-DU sends the user data to SCell O-DU.

The UCI transfer function enables the O-DU to share relevant UCI (examples include CSI, HARQ result) to the peer O-DU.  For example, in DL CA scenario, PUCCH information from UE for all the SCells is received by PCell O-DU which then shares it with SCell O-DUs.

Figure 5.3.21 captures the flow control of user data exchange over D2 connection.

7	D2 application protocol structure

7.1	D2 Control plane protocol (D2-c)

Figure 7.11 shows the protocol structure of D2-c. The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as D2CP

Figure 7.11: Interface Protocol structure for D2-c

The Transport Network Layer is based on IP transport, comprising the SCTP on top of IP. SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 [9] ) shall be supported as the transport layer of D2-c control bearer (D2CP). SCTP refers to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol developed by the Sigtran working group of the IETF for the purpose of transporting various signalling protocols over IP network There shall be only one SCTP association established between two O-DUs. No SCTP Destination Port number value was assigned by IANA for the D2CP protocol and so networks shall rely on O-DU configuration to select a suitable port number.

The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as D2CP (D2 Control Protocol). The Payload Protocol Identifier assigned by IANA to be used by SCTP for the application layer protocol D2CP is 71. This value is to be used for all deployment configurations described in the present document. The byte order of the Payload Protocol Identifier shall be big-endian. The O-DUs shall support a configuration with a single SCTP association per O-DU pair.

The support of any suitable Data Link Layer protocol, e.g. PPP, Ethernet, etc., shall not be prevented.

The O-DUs shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 [10]) and/or IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [11]). The IP layer of D2-c only supports point-to-point transmission for delivering D2CP message.

Between two O-DUs connected by D2 interface:

A single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved over the SCTP association for the sole use of D2CP elementary procedures for D2 interface management.

At least one pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved for the sole use of D2CP elementary procedures are utilized for D2 UE management signalling. However, a few pairs (i.e. more than one) should be reserved.

For a single UE-associated signalling, the O-DU shall use one SCTP association and one SCTP stream, and the association/stream should not be changed during the communication of the UE-associated signalling.

7.2	D2 User plane protocol (D2-u)

 Figure 7.21 shows the protocol stack for D2-u.

Figure 7.21:Protocol stack for D2-u

The D2UP (D2 user plane protocol) messages are transported by UDP over IP. Between a pair of O-DU nodes, one or more UDP ports may be used for D2-u.

8	D2 interface transport requirements

The D2 interface is specified to accommodate the latency class High75, High100 & High200 as described in O-RAN WG9.XTRP [2], section 7.2. D2 interface can also function when using High500 latency but it may have impact on performance.

9	D2 interface management and configuration aspects

The configuration for establishing and functioning of D2 interface is provided by SMO via O1 interface or manualy or via node specific OAM to O-DUs. Parameters such as IP addresses of peer O-DUs, C-RNTIs configured in O-DUs, support of CA (UL, DL, both or None) for each cell in O-DU are needed for functioning of D2 interface.

NOTE:	Detailed definition of configuration parameters will be in O1 specification.

10	D2 interface security requirements

Authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange control or data information over D2 interface shall be supported. Existing security algorithm for example IPSec can be used to protect the D2 interface. User data exchanged over D2 interface is protected by PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol)[8].

NOTE:	Security requirement for protecting the D2 interface will be defined in security specifications.

Annex A (informative): Deployment options

A.1	General deployment considerations

A.2	Deployment model A: Co-located deployments

This model considers the deployment scenarios where relevant O-RAN NFs for carrier aggregation are co-located at a cell site. O-RAN NFs may be supporting the same or different band/duplexing capability.

In this deployment scenario, depicted in Figure A.21and Figure A.22, the MNO may deploy a new O-RU and O-DU to add a new frequency band to the existing infrastructure. The O-DUs will be connected to the single O-CU-CP. The O-DUs can be connected to the multiple O-CU-UPs as shown in Figure A.22. O-DUs are connected by D2 interface to support the inter O-DU carrier aggregation.

Figure A.21: Addition of co-located O-RU and O-DU

Figure A.22:Addition of co-located O-RU and O-DU connected with different O-CU-UPs

A.3	Deployment model B: Non-co-located deployments

This model considers the deployment scenarios where aggregated frequencies are served by equipment that are not co-located at a cell site. O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP might be residing at a centralized location while O-DUs may be located at cell site or at a centralized location.

In this deployment scenario, depicted in Figure A.31 and Figure A.32, the MNO may deploy a new O-RU and O-DU to add a new frequency band, that is not co-located with other O-RUs and O-DUs serving the same geographic area. The O-DUs will be connected to the single O-CU-CP. The O-DUs can be connected to the multiple O-CU-UPs as shown in Figure A.32. O-DUs are connected by D2 interface to support the inter O-DU carrier aggregation.

Annex B (informative): D2 interface Implications

B.1	O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP

O-CU-CP will be able to add, delete or modify the SCells from peer O-DUs, connected by D2 interface and to same O-CU-CP, in UE Context Request/Modification procedures.

No impact on O-CU-UP is expected.

B.2		Synchronization Requirements

Existing synchronization requirement specified in O-RAN WG9.XTRP  [4] section 6.3.3 is sufficient to meet the carrier aggregation requirement as mentioned in 3GPP 38.133 [7].
