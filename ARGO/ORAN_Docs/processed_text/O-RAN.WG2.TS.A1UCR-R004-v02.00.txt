Annex A (normative):
Authorization of service access requests
A.1	Pre-conditions
The preconditions of the A1 use cases in clauses 6 to 8 are that the actors are authorized for using the A1 service and the authorization procedures are defined in SPS [9], clause 4.7. The registration process for the entity acting as service producer is described in SPS [9], clause 4.7.2.2, and the access token request process for the entity acting as service consumer is described in SPS [9], clause 4.7.2.3.
A.2	A1 service access based on token verification use cases
A.2.1	Background and goal of the use cases
The service access request based on token verification is described generically in SPS [9], clause 4.7.2.4.
The A1 service access use cases define how the access token is transferred and verified. This description applies to all solutions specified in clauses 6 to 8 although they do not explicitly refer to token transfer or verification.
A.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use cases
1)	SMO/Non-RT RIC framework:
a)	either makes service access requests containing access token; or
b)	verifies received access token before sending service access responses.
2)	Near-RT RIC:
a)	either verifies received access token before sending service access responses; or
b)	makes service access requests containing access token.
A.2.3	Solutions
A.2.3.1	General
The notation A1 Consumer refers to either A1-P Consumer, A1-EI Consumer, or A1-ML Consumer while the notation A1 Producer refers to either A1-P Producer, A1-EI Producer, or A1-ML Producer. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework acts as A1 Consumer for A1-P and/or A1-ML when Near-RT RIC acts as A1 Producer for A1-P and/or A1-ML, and SMO/Non-RT RIC framework acts as A1 Producer for A1-EI and/or A1-ML when Near-RT RIC acts as A1 Consumer for A1-EI and/or A1-ML.
The notation “service access” for the use case, the procedure, and the request/response messages in this clause refers to the use case, procedure and request/response message names used in the solutions in clauses 6 to 8.
A.2.3.2	Service access request
Table A.2.3.2-1	Service access use case
Figure A.2.3.2-1	Service access
A.2.4	Required data
In addition to the data required in the solutions in clauses 6 to 8, the access token is included in the service access request message.
In case service access is rejected due to that access is forbidden, the service access response message may include information on the token scope necessary to access the service.
