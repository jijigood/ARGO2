4	Background

4.1 	Introduction

This section describes the Common Application Life Cycle Management of applications that are developed by a Solution Provider and delivered to a Service Provider or Network Operator for deployment in an O-Cloud. Once the Solution Provider delivers the NF deployment, it is validated in a test environment prior to giving to operations to deploy.  The description of the delivery of the NF deployments to the Service Provider as part of LCM is detailed in the OAM architecture document. The framework for Lifecycle Management is defined in the OAM Architecture document [1]. The O-RAN Cloudification & Orchestration aspects described here complements the concepts in the OAM Architecture specification. The following diagram in Figure 1 - Common Application Life Cycle Management for ASD is an example that applies to the ASD solution for didactic purposes.

Figure 1 - Common Application Life Cycle Management for ASD

The above diagram depicts some of the key steps in basic application package orchestration:

Step 1, DELIVER: a solution provider (vendor) delivers an application package (app package) which may include a variety of artifacts. These artifacts may include application descriptors, model descriptors, informational artifacts, cloud native artifacts, metadata, and dictionaries.

Step 2, ONBOARDING: Onboarding involves the ingestion, verification, and unpacking of the package and storage into a catalog. The SMO performs these onboarding activities and may usea cloud-native onboarding tools for that purpose. During this process, an AI/ML model can be trained.

Security Package Validation – During onboarding, the security validation of the package or package artifact(s) is performed. See the OAM Architecture document [1] clause 4.1.3, and clause 4.1.4.

Step 3, CERTIFICATION PROCESS: After onboarding, the package undergoes a certification process from the catalog in the SMO. Afterwards, it is published to an artifact repository (aka the run-time library). Certification of the package may include the following: security validation of artifacts, metadata verification, artifact verification against indicated metadata locations. See the OAM Architecture document [1].

Note: The package cannot be certified until training is finished. If the AI/ML training cannot complete, the package is not certified.

Note: The package cannot be certified until security validation of the package is completed.

Note: For some operators, the package may go through part of the certification process before onboarding (Step 1 and Step 2).

Step 4, DEPLOY: In deployment, The deployment tool is given a reference to the image repository entry from which the image can be pulled. Inventory is updated.

4.2	App Package

4.2.1	App Package Concepts

The package concepts are motivated from the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 [2] standards which describe the directory structure and required files for a package.

The Application Package contains:

Manifest file – The manifest file describes the location and types of files in the package.

Metadata – The metadata contains reference information related to the package itself. It is information about the information in the package, hence it is called metadata.

Other artifacts – The package can also contain other artifacts as well such as informational artifacts.

Note: The OAM Architecture specification [1] does not cover details about the application package.

4.2.2 	App Package Security

An important aspect of managing an application package as it relates to O-RAN Cloudification & Orchestration are the security aspects.

There are standards which relate to package security. These include ETSI GS NFV-IFA011 [3] (stage 2) and ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 [2] Clause 5.1 (stage 3) which describes two options for package security:

Option 1 Per Artifact: The VNF package shall contain a Digest (a.k.a. hash) for each of the components of the VNF package. The table of hashes is included in the manifest file, which is signed with the VNF provider private key. In addition, the VNF provider shall include a signing certificate that includes the VNF provider public key, following a pre-defined naming convention and located either at the root of the archive or in a predefined location (e.g., directory). The certificate may also be included in the signature container if the signature format allows that. For example, the CMS format allows to include the certificate in the same container as the signature.

Option 2 Per CSAR Package: The complete CSAR file shall be digitally signed with the VNF provider private key. The VNF provider delivers one zip file consisting of the CSAR file, a signature file and a certificate file that includes the VNF provider public key. Only one signature of the CSAR file shall be present. The certificate may also be included in the signature container if the signature format allows that. The manifest shall be signed in both option 1 and option 2. Only one signature of the manifest shall be present.

Figure 2 - Package Security Approaches

4.2.3 	App Package DeploymentDescriptor

This section describes the Application Package (App Package) as it relates to O-RAN Cloudification & Orchestration. The OAM Architecture document (see reference [1]) details the Application Package model which details the high-level composition of the Application Package (AppPackage). This is shown in figure 2. The part of that model that is pertinent to O-RAN cloudification & orchestration that is within scope of the [Work Item Technical Report] is demarcated with a blue box in figure 2.

This section also describes the Application Service Descriptor (ASD) and the VNF Descriptor (VNFD) in the application package. These two things serve the same function in their respective profiles, and these terms are used interchangeably through the rest of the document. The ASD is a simplified deployment descriptor compared to the VNFD for CNFs, xApps and rApps to leverage enhancements in orchestrators.

Figure 3 - Deployment Descriptor Model

In figure 2, the part of the model highlighted with the blue box, shows that the DeploymentDescriptor is contained within an AppPackage. The DeploymentDescriptor has a composition relationship to Deployment Item(s). The Deployment Item(s) has a composition (containment) relationship to one cloud native descriptor files. The DeploymentItem has an association relationship with the ExecutableImage(s) which has a cardinality of zero to many.

In figure 2, the part of the model highlighted with the blue box, ties back to the application package model management descriptor which is described in more detail in this TR. Note: future versions of this document will further describe this part of the model (in the blue box).

This TR suggests that the DeploymentDescriptor and DeploymentItem(s) be contained within one artifact in the package as an Application Service Descriptor (ASD) or VNF Descriptor (VNFD). The DeploymentItem is part of the ASD. However, it is possible that the DeploymentDescriptor and DeploymentItem(s) could be in separate artifact.

There will be metadata pertaining to the cloud native descriptor file. The metadata will include the checksum/hash, and type of file (helm, K8s manifest, SOL doc). From a workflow perspective, it uses the metadata to determine the appropriate action to take. The ASD allows the SMO to determine the resource requirements based on variables of the cloud native descriptor file. The deployment requirements can be derived for the executable image from the deployment item and the cloud native descriptor file.

The OAM architecture document and Information Model specification in reference [1] in the Lifecycle Management section describes the full model and the components show in more detail.

Use Case Title

Deployment Flow using ASD and Cloud Native Artifacts Use Case

Goal

The SMO uses the data available in the respective Deployment Descriptor to extract the specific xNF constraints (e.g., additional connectivity requirements, specific infrastructure capabilities needed, the specific input values provided in the lifecycle Parameters, etc.).

The SMO makes the homing decision (choses a Kubernetes cluster) that matches the xNFs deployment requirements and parameterizes the cloud artifacts according to the received input (such as K8s resource descriptions, ASD, and other relevant data available for respective deployment).

Actors and Roles

Cloud Operator – An operator of the Cloud.

SMO: Orchestrator – One of the components in the SMO that coordinates orchestration.

SMO: Deployment Tool – One of the components in the SMO that manages the cloud native deployment.

O-Cloud DMS – The O-Cloud Deployment Management Services.

Assumptions

Deployment tool – It is assumed that the SMO has the proper deployment tool that corresponds to the artifactType in the DeploymentItem. For example, helm.

Deployment descriptors – This consists of a DeploymentDescriptor and one to many CloudNativeDescriptorFiles.

Preconditions

Onboarded & Cataloged – The App Package for NF Deployment is onboarded and cataloged.

Connectivity – SMO has connectivity to O-Cloud.

O-Cloud Operational – O-Cloud has registered its DMS with the SMO.

Begins when

This use case begins when the Cloud Operator initiates the creation of a NF Deployment.

Step 1 (M)

The Cloud operator initiates a deployment operation which consists of a set of a DeploymentItem, which supports complex applications that require multiple artifacts (like Helm charts) to be installed in a particular order.

Each deploymentOrder is from a list of DeploymentItem constructs. Each DeploymentItem has lifeCycleParameters that show how the input parameters for that deployment are mapped into their respective CloudNativeDescriptorFiles.

Step 2 (M)

EXTRACTS xNF CONSTRAINTS

The orchestrator extracts xNF constraints from the NF deployment descriptor, in this case the ASD.

Step 3 (ALT, OPT)

COLLECT INPUT & PARAMETERIZATIONS(Optional)

The purpose of the collect input & parameterizations step is to use input received from the Cloud operator for this deployment and map it into the CloudNativeDescriptorFiles according to mapping provided by the lifeCycleParameters and determine a K8s Resource Descriptor.

The deployment tool receives and processes the cloud artifacts and lifeCycleParameters native to the cloud artifact. The artifactType defines the type of artifacts within the DeploymentItem and what will be native to those artifacts.

The lifeCycleParameters are the list of parameters that can be overridden at deployment time (e.g., the list of parameters in the values.yaml).

Step 4 (ALT, OPT)

OUTPUT K8s MANIFEST FILES

The deployment tool returns the K8s manifest files and collects the resources requirements.

Step 5 (ALT, OPT)

PROCESS K8s MANIFEST FILE

K8s Manifest is processed to update the xNF constraints.

Step 6 (M)

CALCULATE RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

The orchestrator calculates the resource requirements.

Step 7 (ALT)

HOMING DECISION (CLUSTER ID IS NOT PROVIDED)

The orchestrator performs the homing step.

The homing decision uses the aggregated resource requirements, constraints fetched from the DeploymentDescriptor (e.g., ASD) and data available locally for the SMO to process the decision. Note: data may be anything that the SMO knows out of the scope of the ASD and K8s resource descriptor.

The orchestrator makes a homing decision that matches the NF deployment requirements. It identifies a K8s cluster type or instance to deploy upon. The Homing operation selects the DMS that will be used. If an operator has multiple clouds (each one with multiple DMSes), the orchestrator will identify which cloud and DMS that are used.

Step 8 (ALT)

HOMING DECISION (CLUSTER ID IS AVAILABLE)

The orchestrator checks that the inventory has the referred cluster with free resources for placement based on the aggregated resource requirements. Also, it checks that the cluster fulfils the constraints from the DeploymentDescriptor.

Step 9 (ALT)

POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE FLOW: HOMING DECISION (CLUSTER ID PROVIDED BUT NO FREE RESOURCES OR CONSTRAINTS NOT FULFILED)

The cluster designated by the Cluster ID doesn’t have the free resources needed for the application deployment.

A failure notification is sent.

The orchestrator continues to seek a suitable cluster, going back to step 5.

Note: The repetition, defaults for retries of the homing decision are implementation specific.

Step 10 (ALT)

ALT FLOW: ADDITIONAL CLUSTER PROVISIONING IS NEEDED

This alt flow is used if additional cluster provisioning is required.

For example, it might be the case that the deployment requires an inter-cluster network. The deployment may span more than one cluster. In this case, the orchestrator may have to go back to FOCOM/IMS because the cluster networks would need to be provisioned in the IMS.

Step 11 (ALT)

ALT FLOW: CONFIGURE THE CLUSTER

The orchestrator will instruct FOCOM/IMS to configure the cluster.

Step 12 (M)

DEPLOYMENT REQUEST

The deployment is performed with the cluster ID, and the required cloud artifacts (e.g., K8s manifest).

Step 13 (M)

DEPLOYMENT REQUEST

The orchestrator (SMO) requests for the deployment tools (SMO) for the deployment operation with the Cluster ID, lifeCycle Parameters and Cloud Artifacts.

Step 14 (M)

DEPLOYMENT

The deployment tool requests for the deployment operation towards O2 DMS over the O2dms Interface.

The Inventory is updated within the SMO for the deployment.

Ends When

The application has been deployed to the appropriate cluster. This use case ends when the containerized workload is up and running in a suitable Kubernetes cluster.

Exceptions

Exceptions – A failed deployment occurs; thus, the application could not be deployed. A cluster that matches the requirements was not available for this deployment.

Post-conditions

Success – In a successful post-condition, the containerized workload is up and running in the chosen Kubernetes cluster with a given cluster ID.  O1 registration occurs with the PNF/xNF registering with O1.

Failure – The post-condition upon a failure the deployment did not occur. It is expected that the O-Cloud & O-Cloud infrastructure resources are in the same state.

5.2 Deployment flow for VNFD use case

5.2.1	Introduction

Clause 5.2 describes a use case and flow to deploy an application, such as an NF Deployment into the O-Cloud, using the ETSI NFV defined Virtualised Network Function (VNF) Descriptor (VNFD) specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [3].

NOTE 1:	It is assumed in the use case flow that the SMO interacts with an O-Cloud DMS based on the O2-D demarcation #1 documented in the O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-ETSI-NFV-PROFILE [4]. The use case flow could be revisited, or new ones be derived, in future versions of the present document based on further updates performed to the referenced document.

NOTE 2:	The use case flow illustrates interactions among entities within the SMO and between the SMO and the O-Cloud. Clause 2.3.2 of O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-ETSI-NFV-PROFILE [4] provides the mapping and correspondence of management functions and functional blocks between the O-RAN and ETSI NFV architectural frameworks.

Goal

Application deployment (NF Deployment) into the O-Cloud using VNFD.

Actors and Roles

Cloud operator: an operator of the O-RAN NF and O-Cloud.

SMO logical functions: NFO, FOCOM

Package repository within SMO (see note 1)

O-Cloud DMS: the O-Cloud Deployment Management Services.

NOTE 1:	It is out of scope of the present document to specify whether the SMO supports package repository functions and/or services.

Assumptions

O-Cloud DMS offers NF Deployment management functionality according to the O2-D demarcation #1 documented in O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-ETSI-NFV-PROFILE [4].

Pre-conditions

1) The Cloud operator has required privileges to instantiate the NF

2) The Application Package for NF Deployment, which includes the VNFD and other artifacts, is onboarded and catalogued, and it is valid as per VNF Package and VNFD specification (reference is provided to ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [3] as "VNF Package and VNFD specification").

3) SMO has connectivity to O-Cloud

4) O-Cloud has registered its DMS with the SMO.

Begins when

Cloud operator requests the instantiation of an NF Deployment.

Step 1 (M)

Cloud operator requests to instantiate an NF Deployment based on a VNFD, which is identified in the request. The VNFD contains one or more DeploymentItems describing the requirements for the NF Deployment.

Step 2 (M)

NFO queries the Package repository to get the VNFD from the Application Package corresponding to the NF Deployment requested to be instantiated.

Step 3 (M)

NFO checks the NF Deployment metadata, resource requirements (types and amount), deployment lifecycle parameters and deployment items information from the VNFD.

Step 4 (M)

NFO coordinates with FOCOM to check O-Cloud inventory, capacity and resources availability of the O-Cloud. The request could include a list of identified O-Cloud Sites, if a pre-selection or requirements about specific NF Deployment location are available to the NFO (e.g., provided by the Cloud operator), so that O-Cloud DMS instance that matches the application requirements is selected

Step 5 (M)

NFO performs an NF Deployment homing, which determines the O-Cloud (see note 2) and the respective O-Cloud DMS responsible for the NF Deployment instantiation.

NOTE 2:	It is assumed that the NF Deployment instantiation is confided to a single O-Cloud.

Step 6 (M)

In case of successful homing, the NFO updates inventory information in the SMO based on the homing decision. The NFVO also prepares necessary input data for the NF Deployment instantiation request.

Step 7 (M)

In case of unsuccessful homing, the NFO informs the Cloud operator of unsuccessful NF Deployment instantiation.

Step 8 (M)

NFO requests the O-Cloud DMS to instantiate the NF Deployment. The instantiation request(s) can provide necessary input lifecycle and configuration data for the instantiation. Information about granted resources, target O-Cloud and placement constraints for the NF Deployment can also be provided.

Step 9 (M)

In case the O-Cloud DMS does not have the VNFD and/or other information needed for the instantiation of the NF Deployment (e.g., certain artifacts), the DMS fetches from the Package repository the necessary content of the Application Package.

O-Cloud DMS proceeds with NF Deployment instantiation as described in clause 2.4.2.1 of O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-ETSI-NFV-PROFILE. The O-Cloud DMS uses the information provided at runtime on the request, information from the VNFD and contents from the Application Package to perform the allocation of necessary O-Cloud resources for the NF Deployment.

Clause 2.4.2.1 of O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-ETSI-NFV-PROFILE

Step 10 (M)

In case of successful instantiation of the NF Deployment, the O-Cloud DMS updates the runtime information of the NF Deployment and informs to the NFO of the successful instantiation.

Step 11 (M)

NFO updates the inventory information according to the successful NF Deployment instantiation.

Step 12 (M)

In case of unsuccessful instantiation of the NF Deployment, the O-Cloud DMS informs to the NFO about the failures/errors. The O-Cloud DMS proceed with the rollback of the instantiation.

Step 13 (M)

NFO proceeds with necessary rollback handling, freeing any of the granted/reserved resources for the NF Deployment and updating the inventory information considering the unsuccessful instantiation.

Step 14 (M)

NFO informs the Cloud operator about the result (either successful or not successful) of the instantiation of the NF Deployment.

Ends when

The Cloud operator is informed about the NF Deployment instantiation result.

Exceptions

- NF Deployment homing fails: O-Cloud does not have enough or required resources for the NF Deployment.

- NF Deployment instantiation fails: O-Cloud DMS notifies SMO and SMO informs Cloud operator, and granted/reserved resources are freed, and inventory data is updated accordingly.

Post-conditions

The NF Deployment is instantiated on the O-Cloud.

6 	Information Requirements for K8s-Aware Solution

6.1 	DeploymentDescriptor with Application Service Descriptor

Application Service Descriptor (ASD) describes application metadata for the orchestrator to be used as input for deployment of an application workload that is described by the ASD.

6.1.1 Conventions

The attributes of the ASD information elements are described in the tables provided in section 6.1. Each table has 5 columns, with the following significance:

The "Attribute" column provides the attribute name.

The "Qualifier" column indicates whether the support of the attribute is mandatory, optional or conditional from the SMO perspective.

The "Cardinality" column contains the minimum and maximum cardinality of this information element (e.g., 1, 0 … N, 1 … N). A cardinality range starting with 0 indicates that the attribute need not always be included and 1 indicates that the attribute needs to be always included.

The "Type" column provides information on the type of the attribute values. It can be the name of an Information Element. If a cell in the "Type" is marked as "Not specified", which indicates that the specification of the type is left to the data model.

The "Description" provides a brief explanatory description, additional constraints, and examples.

The ASD is a complementary descriptor to the cloud-native deployment artifacts hence it contains design-time information provided by the application vendor that is not described/available in the cloud native artifacts. Such complementary information in the ASD can include specific infrastructure capabilities requirements for the deployment of the application software workload, constraints on the Kernel type needed, additional networking requirements needed beyond primary connectivity described in the cloud native artifacts, any special CNI (Container Network Interfaces), etc.

ASD can support an application workload deployment on OS container infrastructures, and it is applicable to O-RAN NFs, xApps, and rApps.

The following figure illustrates the representation of O-RAN OAM Application Packaging Model [WG10. Common Package] and shows how the Application Service Descriptor is positioned within the Application Package Model.

"activeActiveBond",
"activePassiveBond",   "activePassivel3",

”infraProvided” The application sees one vNIC, but the infrastructure provides redundant access to the network via both switch planes. For interface of type kernel.netdev the redundancy is provided by the vSwitch or Linux bonding. For interfaces of type direct, it requires that the physical NIC is connected to both switch planes (a.k.a. smartNIC). Thus, it imposes hardware requirements on the infrastructure. For interface of type userspace redundancy handled by a DPDK-OVS or VPP vSwitch

”left” and ”right” indicates a vNIC connected non-redundantly to the network via one specific (left or right) switchplane.

All other attributes indicate a mated vNIC pair in the Pod, one connecting to the network via left switchplane and the other connecting to the network via the right switchplane, and with application using them together as a redundant network interface using a particular redundancy method that need to be accomodated in the node infrastructure.
"activeActiveBond": Requires a static multi-chassis LAG in active-active mode from the infrastructure. Typically corresponds to bonding mode-2 “balance-xor”
"activePassiveBond": The interfaces are bonded in active-passive mode in the application with move of bond MAC address. No specific requirements on DC fabric. Typically corresponds to bonding mode-1 “active-backup”
"activePassivel3": Application moves its IP address by attaching it to one of the two MACs by use of GARP messages.

Description

loadbalancerIP

M

0..1

String

When present, this attribute specifies the name of the deployment artifact input parameter through which the orchestrator can configure the loadbalancerIP parameter of the K8s service or ingress controller that the ExtCpd represents.

Note 2

externalIPs

M

0..N

String

When present, this attribute specifies the name of the deployment artifact input parameter through which the orchestrator can configure the extermalIPs parameter of the K8s service or ingress controller, or the pod network interface annotation, that the ExtCpd represents. The param name and provided IP address(es) value will be passed to the deployment tool when deploying the DeploymentArtifacts.

Note 2

nadNames

M

0..N

String

These attributes specify, for an ExtCpd representing a secondary network interface, the name(s) of the deployment artifact input parameter(s) through which the orchestrator can provide the names of the network attachment definitions (NADs) the orchestrator has created as base for the network interface the ExtCpd represents.
It is expected that the NADs themselves have been created prior to the deployment of the deployment artifacts.

Note 1,2,3

nadNamespace

M

0..1

String

Specifies, for an ExtCpd representing a secondary network interface, the name of the deployment artifact input parameter through which the orchestrator can provide the namespace where the NADs are located.
Attribute may be omitted if the namespace is same as the application namespace.

Note 2

Table 6.6 ExtCpdParamMappings IE

Note 1: When the ExtCpd represent a networkRedundant/mated pair of sriov interfaces, there are references to 2 or 3 related NADs needed to be passed, while for other interface types only one NAD reference is needed to be passed.

Note 2: The format of the Content strings is specific for each different orchestration templating technology used (Helm, Teraform, etc.). Currently only a format for use with Helm charts is suggested: "<helmchartname>:[<subchartname>.] 0 ... N[<parentparamname>.] 0 … N<paramname>”. Whether the optional parts of the format are present depends on how the parameter is declared in the helm chart. An example is: "chartName:subChart1.subChart2.subChart3.Parent1.Parent2.Parent3.parameter".

Note 3:  A direct attached (passthrough) network interface, such as an sriov interface, attaches to a network via only one of the two switch planes in the infrastructure.
When using a direct attached network interface one therefore commonly in a pod uses a mated pair of sriov network attachments, where each interface attaches same network but via different switchplane.
The application uses the mated pair of network interfaces as a single logical “swith-path-redundant” network interface – and this is represented by a single ExtCpd.
Also, there is a case where a third “bond” attachment interface is used in the pod, bonding the two direct interfaces so that the application does not need to handle the redundancy issues – application just uses the bond interface.
In this case all three attachments are together making up a logical “switch-path-redundant” network interface represented by a single ExtCpd. When three NADs are used in the ExtCpd the NAD implementing the bond attachment interface is provided through the parameter indicated in the third place in the nadNames attribute.

9 Recommendations

9.1 Introduction

This TR is structured in a modular fashion organized by major topics and the following sections provide relevant recommendations by topic.

9.2 Recommendation for Deploy flow use case & requirements

The deployment flow use case for ASD is recommended to be incorporated into the Cloudification & Orchestration Use Case and Requirements document.

9.3 Recommendation for DeploymentDescriptor based on ASD

This is described in Clause 6.1 and Clause 6.2

The team producing this TR has considered four options for where that content might be placed:

O2 DMS Interface Spec (new) WG6 Stage 2 –

The O2 DMS Interface Specification would be a sister document in WG6 to the existing O2 IMS Interface Specification. It would be a new document which would also be the home for other O2 DMS topics, such as O2 DMS fault and O2 DMS performance management. So, it could be created for DeploymentDescription as well as the other O2 DMS topic areas.

WG10 App Pkg Spec [out of place wrong WG]

Another possibility is to put into the WG10 App Package Specification; however, it is not proper working group.

O2 DMS LCM - O2 DeploymentDesc for ASD (new WG6 document)

A new separate dedicated for ASD modelling could be an option.

O2 DMS K8s Profile [this is a Stage 2 material being put into Stage 3 document]

Incorporating the material into the Stage 3 O2 DMS K8s Profile document. The problem with that is that it is stage 2 material going into a stage 3 document.
