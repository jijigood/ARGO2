4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed.
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed.
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Service	when referring to a Service in the specification the SERVICE NAME is written with upper case characters and in bold followed by the word "service", e.g. REPORT service.
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
4.3	Identifiers
For the purposes of the present document, the following identifiers are defined:
Style Type	The identifier used to nominate a specific approach or Style used to exposing a given RIC Service (REPORT, INSERT, CONTROL and POLICY).  The same E2SM may support more than one Style for each RIC Service.
Format Type	The identifier used to nominate a specific formatting approach used to encode one of the E2AP IEs defined in this E2SM.  The same E2SM may support more than one encoding Formats for each E2AP IE and each E2AP IE message encoding Format may be used by one or more RIC Service Styles.
5	E2SM services
As defined in E2 General Aspects and Principles [2], a given RAN Function offers a set of services to be exposed over the E2 (REPORT, INSERT, CONTROL, POLICY and/or QUERY) using E2AP [3] defined procedures.  Each of the E2AP Procedures listed in table 5-1 contains specific E2 Node RAN Function dependent Information Elements (IEs).
Table 5-1: Relationship RAN Function specific E2AP Information elements and E2AP Procedures
All of these RAN Function specific E2AP IEs are defined in E2AP [3] as “OCTET STRING”.
The purpose of the E2SM series of specifications is to define the recommended approach that a given RAN Function specific E2 Service Model would use to define the contents of these fields.
In the current version of the specifications, the following O-RAN specified E2 Service Models are supported:
Table 5-2: O-RAN specified E2 Service Models and related OIDs
6	Common Elements for E2SM Service Models
6.1	General
Sub clause 6.2 presents the individual information elements that may be adopted by any specific E2SM including the specifications listed in table 5-1. Sub clause 6.3 provides the corresponding ASN.1 definition of each information element, this module may be associated with the ASN.1 definitions in a specific E2SM specification using the ASN.1 "Import" instruction.
The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the messages and information elements:
NOTE:	The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in 3GPP TR 25.921 [13].
6.2	Information Element definitions
6.2.1	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.
