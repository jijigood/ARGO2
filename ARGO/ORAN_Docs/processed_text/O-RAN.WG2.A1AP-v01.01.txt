A1 application protocol
This document contains a REST method realization of the interface architecture and policy procedures defined in [3]. It is based on HTTP transport as defined in [4].
This definition of the A1 Application Protocol (A1AP) is based on the 3GPP service framework for network functions [5]. It corresponds to a REST-based Solution Set and is based on the structure in the 3GPP specification 29.501 [6] and the related template [7]. The design patterns for HTTP procedures are based on [8] and the design patterns for JSON objects are based on [9].
A1 Services
3.1	Introduction
The A1AP contains APIs for the services defined in [3]:
A1-P – Policy Management Service
A1-ML – ML Model Management Service
A1-EI – Enrichment Information Service
The A1AP is based on signaling between an A1 service consumer and an A1 service producer residing in the non-RT RIC or in the near-RT RIC.
Figure 3.1-1 Service framework for the A1 services.
The interactions between Service Consumer and Service Producer is based on the service framework used for 3GPP Network Functions [5] section 7.1.2 where requests are sent from the Consumer and responses and notifications are sent from the from the Producer. It is the Producer that handles the resources on which the Consumer performs operations. The terms consumer and producer does, thus, not refer to the direction of the data transfer over the A1 interface.
3.2	Policy Management Service
Definitions of A1 policy, policy statements, policy procedures and A1 policy life cycle aspects are found in [3]. This document defines a REST based solution set for how to realize A1 policies and perform operations on them over the A1 interface [4].
3.2.1	Service Description
3.2.1.1	Functional elements
The A1AP is based on signaling between the A1-P Consumer residing in the non-RT RIC and the A1-P Producer residing in the near-RT RIC. Both the A1-P Consumer and the A1-P Producer contains a HTTP Client and a HTTP Server.
Figure 3.2-1 HTTP roles in service framework.
The A1AP realizes the A1 policy procedures defined in [3] using HTTP [4] operations where a policy is represented as a JSON object [10].
3.2.1.2	Policy representation
The following principles are used for A1 policies when JSON is used as resource representation format:
A policy corresponds to a resource (in the REST sense);
A policy is represented as a JSON object referred to as a policy object;
A policy object contains a scope identifier and at least one policy statement (e.g. one or more policy objective statements and/or one or more policy resource statements);
A policy is identified by a policyId that is included in the URI when operation is for a single policy;
The policyId is assigned by the A1-P Consumer when the policy is created;
The A1-P Producer cannot modify or delete a policy;
Policy feedback for a specifc policy is subscribed to when the policy is created by providing a callback URI in the create policy operation;
A policy object does not contain any information related to which internal function in the near-RIC that is to evaluate the policy.
3.2.1.3	Representation objects
The following JSON objects are used within the service operations of the A1-P service:
PolicyObject
The policy object is the JSON representation of a complete A1 policy.
PolicyStatusObject
The policy status object is the JSON representation of the enforcement status of an A1 policy.
ProblemDetails
The problem details object is the JSON representation of the content in a response message with other HTTP error response codes (4xx/5xx).
3.2.1.4	Resource identifiers
The main URI for A1 policies is:
…/policies
A single policy can be operated upon by adding the value of the policy identifier to the URI:
…/policies/{policyId}
The main URI for status of a single policy is:
…/policies/{policyId}/status
The URI for policy notification is referred to as the notificationDestination and is based on a callback URI provided when creating a policy.
3.2.2	Service Operations
The following table describes the mapping between the A1 policy procedures and the HTTP methods used to realise them.
Table 3.2-1 A1 procedures to HTTP methods mapping.
3.2.2.1	Introduction
The following sections describe the policy operations. For details on the policy objects (in JSON format) transferred in the HTTP message bodies, see Annex B.
The policy scope in a policy object contains a scope identifier that can be e.g. a ueId, a groupId or a cellId. The A1-P Consumer needs to map policyIds to scope identifiers in order to manage e.g. all policies applicable to a specific individual ueId. If there are several polices related to a single scope identifier, then several policy requests need to be made to manage that specific individualin a sequence of single policy operations.
3.2.2.2	Create policy
3.2.2.2.1	General
An A1 policy is created using a HTTP PUT request containing a policy object in the payload. The format of the policy object is checked, and the request is either accepted or rejected. If accepted, the policy is to be enforced.
3.2.2.2.2	Create single policy
The operation to create a single policy is based on HTTP PUT and a policyId created by the the A1-P Consumer.
Figure 3.2.2.2-1 Create single policy procedure.
The procedure is as follows:
The A1-P Consumer generates the policyId and sends a HTTP PUT request to the A1-P Producer. The target URI identifies the resource (policyId) under which the new policy shall be created. The message body carries a complete policy object.
The A1-P Producer returns the HTTP PUT response. On success, “201” is returned. The location header is present and carries the URI of the new policy and the message body the complete policy object. On failure, the appropriate error code is returned and the message body may contain additional error information.
3.2.2.2.3	Create multiple policies
The operation to create multiple policies is a sequence of operations to create a single policy.
3.2.2.3	Query policy
3.2.2.3.1	General
A1-P Consumer can use the query policy procedure to read a single policy or to check which policies that exist.
3.2.2.3.2	Query single policy
The operation to query a single policy is based on HTTP GET. The policy to be read is identified with a URI that includes the policyId while the message body is empty and the response returns the complete policy object.
Figure 3.2.2.3-1 Query single policy procedure.
The procedure is as follows:
The A1-P Consumer sends a HTTP GET request to the A1-P Producer. The target URI identifies the policy to be read based on the policyId under the parent resource “/policies”. The message body is empty.
The A1-P Producer returns the HTTP GET response. On success, “200 OK” is returned. The message body carries a complete policy object representing the read policy. On failure, the appropriate error code is returned and the message response body may contain additional error information.
3.2.2.3.3	Query multiple policies
The operation to query multiple policies is a sequence of operations to query a single policy.
NOTE: to query all policies applicable to e.g. a dynamically defined group of UEs, a slice or a cell, the A1-P Consumer need to map the scope identifier to the applicable policyId(s) and make a sequence of requests.
3.2.2.3.4	Query all policies
See operation for query multiple policies.
3.2.2.3.5	Query all policy identities
The operation to query all policy identities is based on HTTP GET. The collection of policy identities to be read is identified within the URI while the message body is empty and the response returns an array of identities representing all policies in the collection.
Figure 3.2.2.3-3 Query all policy identities procedure.
3.2.2.3.6	Query policy status
The operation to query status for a single policy is based on HTTP GET. The policy for which status is to be read is identified with a URI that includes the policyId while the message body is empty and the response returns a policy status object.
Figure 3.2.2.3-4 Query policy status procedure.
3.2.2.4	Update policy
3.2.2.4.1	General
A1-P Consumer can use the update policy procedure to completely replace one policy.
3.2.2.4.2	Update single policy
The operation to completely update a single policy is based on HTTP PUT. The policy to be updated is identified with a URI that includes the policyId and the message body contains the complete policy object for the updated policy.
Figure 3.2.2.4-1 Update completely single policy procedure.
The procedure is as follows:
The A1-P Consumer sends a HTTP PUT request to the A1-P Producer. The target URI identifies the policy to be updated based on the policyId under the parent resource “/policies”. The message body contains a complete policy object.
The A1-P Producer returns the HTTP PUT response. On success, “200 OK” is returned. The message body carries a complete policy object representing the updated policy. On failure, the appropriate error code is returned and the message response body may contain additional error information.
NOTE:	In case the policy does not exist, the PUT request is handled as a create policy request and “201 Created” is returned.
3.2.2.4.3	Update multiple policies
The operation to update multiple policies is a sequence of operations to update a single policy.
3.2.2.4.4	(Void)
3.2.2.4.5	(Void)
3.2.2.5	Delete policy
3.2.2.5.1	General
A1-P Consumer can use the delete policy procedure to delete a single policy or to delete multiple policies.
3.2.2.5.2	Delete single policy
The operation to delete a single policy is based on HTTP DELETE. The policy to be deleted is identified with a URI that includes the PolicyId. Neither request nor response contain any policy object in the message body.
Figure 3.2.2.5-1 Delete single policy procedure.
The procedure is as follows:
The A1-P Consumer sends a HTTP DELETE request to the A1-P Producer. The target URI identifies the policy to be deleted based on the PolicyId under the parent resource “/policies”. The message body is empty.
The A1-P Producer returns the HTTP DELETE response. On success, “204 No Content” is returned. The message body is empty. On failure, the appropriate error code is returned and the message response body may contain additional error information.
3.2.2.5.3	Delete multiple policies
The operation to delete multiple policies is a sequence of operations to delete a single policy.
3.2.2.6	Policy feedback
3.2.2.6.1	General
Policy feedback is an operation that requires the A1-P Producer to have a reduced feature HTTP Client for sending HTTP POST requests and receiving HTTP POST responses. Correspondingly, the A1-P Consumer is required to have a reduced feature HTTP Server for receiving HTTP POST requests and sending HTTP POST responses.
The A1-P Producer uses the policy feedback operation to notify the A1-P Consumer about:
Changes in the policy enforcement status for an A1 policy;
All notifications are sent to the URI for notification handling and the PolicyStatusObject contains the information about changes and causes.
3.2.2.6.2	Policy status update
The operation to provide policy feedback is based on HTTP POST. The URI contains the target resource for policy notification handling. The notification content is represented in a policy status object that is included in the message body and can contain one notification.
The procedure is used to notify about an enforcement status change of a policy between ‘enforced’ and ‘not enforced’.
Figure 3.2.2.6-1 Policy enforcement feedback procedure.
The procedure is as follows:
The A1-P Producer sends a HTTP POST request to the A1-P Consumer. The target URI (notificationDestination) identifies the sink for policy notifications. The message body contains a policy status object.
The A1-P Consumer returns the HTTP POST response with “204 No Content”. The message body is empty.
3.3	ML Model Management Service
No explicit ML Model service operations are defined in this version of the specification.
3.4	Enrichment Information Service
No explicit Enrichment Information service operations are defined in this version of the specification.

Note 2: In this version of the specification, the QoE target is applicable to video streaming services.
Application server will measure the QoE related attributes (e.g. MOS, initial buffering, reBuffFreq, stallRatio) for a specific service based on application info. However, it’s too late for network to optimize the radio resource when the application server find the QoE is too bad. Near-RT RIC could predict the QoE related attributes based on the network side info (e.g. QoS parameters, radio conditions, Packet measure report etc.) e.g. by performing model inference for a specific ML model received from non-RT RIC. The predict value is approximately the QoE related attribute which will be measured at application server later, but it’s estimated at Near-RT RIC in real time. So Near-RT RIC could decide to optimize the radio resource based on the predict value and the QoE target contained in the A1 policy.
4.2.6.2.4	Traffic steering preference
The TspResources statement contains the following attributes:
Table 4.2.6.2.4-1: Definition of statement type TspResources
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the attribute shall be included when this statement is used while "O" means that it is optional to include.
When the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER or AVOID, the cellIdList contains cells in descending order of importance for how they should be preferred or avoided, e.g. the first entry is most preferred or most avoided.  When the preference value is set to SHALL or FORBID, the cellIdList contains cells that are of equal importance.
When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the value of the preference attribute is set to SHALL, then only a cell in the cellIdList is to be used as primary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER, then a cell in the cellIdList may be used as primary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the preference value is set to AVOID or FORBID, then no cell in the cellIdList is to be used as primary cell.
When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the value of the preference attribute is set to SHALL, then only one or more cells in the cellIdList are to be used as secondary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER, then one or more cells in the cellIdList may be used as secondary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the preference value is set to AVOID or FORBID, then no cell in the cellIdList is to be used as secondary cell.
When the primary attribute is not included, the statement shall be handled in the same way as when the primary attribute is set to false.

4.2.6.4	Policy representations objects
This section contains the formal representation definitions of the policy representation object types defined in 3.2.1.4.
4.2.6.4.1	Policy object
4.2.6.4.1.1	General
A policy object is based on IETF RFC 8259 [10] (JSON) and it always contains one set of:
one scope identifier;
and
one or more policy statements.
The scope identifier can be either:
an identifier for a single UE (ueId);
an identifier for a group of UEs (groupId);
an identifier for a slice (sliceId);
an identifier for QoS (qosId);
an identifier for a cell (cellId).
Table 4.2.6.4.1.1-1: General definition of PolicyObject
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the data type shall be included in a policy object. Allowed combinations are listed in table 4.2.6.4.1.2-1. Presence condition "C" means that at least one statement (objectives and/or resources) shall be included.
4.2.6.4.1.2	Allowed combinations
A policy statement can be applied together with scope identifiers containing different combinations of identifiers. Not all combinations are relevant. The following table indicates combinations that are allowed.
Table 4.2.6.4.1.2-1: Allowed combinations of scope identifiers and policy statements
Note: on each row is listed a combination of identifiers that is allowed for the indicated statement. Notation is the same as for caridinality: "0" means the identifier shall not occur, "0..1" means the identifier may occur and "1" means the identifier shall occur. Only at most one occurance of an identifier is allowed in the present version.
4.2.6.4.4.1	General
A policy status object is based on IETF RFC 8259 [10] (JSON) and always contains:
one enforcement status statement.
4.2.6.4.2	(Void)
4.2.6.4.3	(Void)
4.2.6.4.4	Policy status object
4.2.6.4.4.2	Policy status object
Table 4.2.6.4.4.2-1: General definition of PolicyStatusObject
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the data type shall be included in a policy status object. Presence condition "C" means that the enforceReason shall be included when the policy status object is used in the Policy Status Update procedure.
4.2.6.4.5	(Void)
4.2.6.5	Binary data
Binary data is not applicable in this version of the specification.
4.2.7	Error Handling
4.2.7.1	General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [20] and according to the principles in 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].
4.2.7.2	Protocol Errors
No protocol errors are described in this version of the specification.
4.2.7.3	Application Errors
The application errors defined for the A1-P service are listed in Table 4.2.7.3-1.

Annex Z
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O-RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O-RAN Alliance and the entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”).
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification.
SECTION 1:  DEFINITIONS
1.1		“Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity, so long as such control exists.  For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity.
1.2		“Compliant Portion” means only those specific portions of products (hardware, software or combinations thereof) that implement any O-RAN Specification.
1.3	 	“Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications.
1.4		“Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O-RAN Specification.  The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates.
1.5		“Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable by a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment of consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by implementation of a Final Specification (without considering any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O-RAN Alliance or the date the patent claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate an implementation which complies with a Final Specification without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent claims shall be considered Necessary Claims.
1.6		“Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates.
SECTION 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE
2.1		Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in furtherance of implementations of an O-RAN Specification.
2.2		Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written agreement with O-RAN Alliance.
SECTION 3: FRAND LICENSE
3.1		Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable,  worldwide license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Portions; provided, however, that such license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Portion is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Portion; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal grant to Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors, as set forth in Section 3.3.  For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing license includes the distribution by the Adopter’s distributors and the use by the Adopter’s customers of such licensed Compliant Portions.
3.2 	Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees.
3.3		Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates under FRAND terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable,  worldwide license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Portions; provided, however, that such license will not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Portion is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Portion; or (b) to any Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates that is not making a reciprocal grant to Adopter, as set forth in Section 3.1.

4.3		Sections 1, 3, 5 - 11 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  Under surviving Section 3, after termination of this Agreement, Adopter will continue to grant licenses (a) to entities who become Adopters after the date of termination; and (b) for future versions of O-RAN Specifications that are backwards compatible with the version that was current as of the date of termination.
