Security protocols specifications for O-RAN compliant implementation

SSH

General requirements

O-RAN interfaces that implement authentication, confidentiality and integrity using SSH shall:

support SSHv2 [2] and [70];

disable by default cryptographically insecure ciphers as specified in clauses 4.1.2.1, 4.1.2.3, and 4.1.2.4;

enable an O-RAN deployer to configure SSH to offer less secure ciphers using standard SSH configurations to enable backward compatibility with older SSH implementations;

enable remote shell access only if required by the interface. If remote shell access is enabled, disable remote login as root or equivalent highest privileged user. Such access shall be limited to the local system console only. Root user shall not be allowed to login to the system remotely.

Entities providing O-RAN components that support SSH for authentication, confidentiality or integrity shall:

stay current with SSH [5];

provide an upgrade path for changes to the SSH protocol and ciphers [5].

Required ciphers

O-RAN requires the following ciphers when using SSH. For more information see [2], [5], [11], [12], [13], [14] and [15]. See Security clause 5.4 of the O-RAN Working Group 4 Management Plane Specification [6] for the M-plane mandated SSH ciphers.

TLS

General Requirements

O-RAN interfaces that implement one-way authentication, mutual authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection using Transport Layer Security (TLS) shall be compliant with [18], allow negotiation of both TLS 1.2 [18] and TLS 1.3 [18], and not allow negotiation to any version of SSL or any version of TLS below 1.2. Further, O-RAN interfaces using TLS may allow TLS 1.2 to be disabled by configuration ([i.4], section 3.1).

NOTE: In one-way TLS the server sends a Certificate message, a CertificateVerify message, and a Finished message to the client so that the client can authenticate the server by validating the server’s certificate and possession of the private key associated with the certificate. In mutual TLS (mTLS) the server sends a CertificateRequest message indicating that the client must authenticate itself with a certificate. The server then sends a Certificate message, a CertificateVerify message, and a Finished message to the client. Upon receiving the server's messages, the client responds with its Authentication messages, namely Certificate and CertificateVerify, and Finished. For full details of the authentication steps in TLS see [18].

See clause 5.4 of the O-RAN Working Group 4 Management Plane Specification for the Open Fronthaul M-plane mandated TLS requirements [6].

Void

Void

TLS Protocol Profile

TLS 1.2 used on all interfaces except the Open Fronthaul interfaces shall support the TLS 1.2 profiles as defined by 3GPP TS 33.210 [20] clause 6.2.3.

TLS 1.3 used on all interfaces except the Open Fronthaul interfaces shall support the TLS 1.3 profiles as defined by 3GPP TS 33.210 [20] clause 6.2.2.

Use of a cipher suite in TLS shall be configurable.

Additional cipher suites recommended by IANA [52] may be supported.

TLS Certificate Profile

The present clause addresses the certificate profile requirements for the TLS entities that may behave either as client, server, or both. The structure of the TLS certificate profile described in this clause under Table 4.2.31 provides requirements based on the 3GPP – TS 33.310 [26], CA-Browser Forum [56] and NIST Special Publication 800-52.2 [i.4]. The TLS entity certificate profile shall be applied to all nodes and interfaces that use the TLS protocol for secured communication in the O-RAN network except the Open Fronthaul interfaces.

The TLS entity certificates shall adhere to the certificate profile outlined in the Table 4.2.31, based on their respective roles.

The CA responsible for handling the certificate signing request shall ensure compliance in accordance with the certificate profile specified in clause 4.2.3.

The common rules for all certificates defined in 3GPP- TS 33.310 [26], clause 6.1.1 and 6.1.3a shall apply.

The CA-Browser Forum [56] has the following requirement for the certificate operational and key usage periods. Certificates issued on or after 1 September 2020 shall not have a Validity Period greater than 397 days.

Subject: The subject field follows the X.501 type Name as defined in clause 4.1.2.6 of IETF RFC 5280 [64].

Certificate Policies: Certificate policies shall be crafted using the guidelines defined in IETF RFC 3647 [63].

subjectAltName shall (for TLS server certificates) contain at least one FQDN(Hostname) and shall not contain only IP Address as described in IETF RFC 6066 [22]. As per IETF RFC 6125 [54], an application service shall be identified by a name or names carried in the subject field (i.e., a CN-ID) and/or in one of the following identifier types within subjectAltName entries (DNS-ID, SRV-ID. URI-ID).

Optional and non-critical TLS Feature Extension: IETF RFC 7633 [55] defines a certificate extension that indicates that clients expect stapled OCSP responses with a value of “status_request (5)” for the certificate and aborts the handshake ("hard-fail") if such a response is not available. As per IETF RFC 9325 [71] TLS servers should support the following as a best practice: OCSP IETF RFC 6960 [62] and OCSP stapling using the status_request extension defined in IETF RFC 6066 [22]. The exact mechanism for embedding the status_request extension differs between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. As a matter of local policy, server operators may request that CAs issue must-staple IETF RFC 7633 [55] certificates for the server and/or for client authentication.

Extensions: Mandatory Critical Key Usage

digitalSignature for both TLS client and Server certificates. This applies for RSA signature certificate, ECDSA signature certificate, or DSA signature certificate.

When using RSA IETF RFC 3279 [72] with TLS 1.2, the keyEncipherment shall be set.

When using DH [72] or ECDH [72] with TLS 1.2, the keyAgreement shall be set.

As per the certificate profile requirements described in clause 4.2.3 and guidelines outlined in IETF RFC 5280 [64], the following table captures the certificate profile for the TLS entity that may behave as a client, server or both.

Support NETCONF over secure Transport

TLS requirements for use with NETCONF on the O1 interface [10] are specified in clause 4.2.

TLS requirements for use with NETCONF on the Open Fronthaul M-plane are specified in clause 5.4 of the O-RAN WG4 Management Plane Specification [6].

DTLS

General requirements

O-RAN interfaces that implement mutual authentication, integrity protection, replay protection and confidentiality protection using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) shall:

support DTLS 1.2 [76];

support DTLS for Stream Control Transmission Protocol [24];

and should support DTLS 1.3 [76].

DTLS 1.0 shall not be supported.

NOTE 1: IETF RFC 6083 [24] specifies a user message limit of approximately 16k bytes, which shall be compared to the unlimited user message size that exists when SCTP is used without DTLS. There could be applications messages exceeding the limit, preventing the use of DTLS over SCTP, so enforcing unsecured SCTP.

DTLS Protocol Profile

For DTLS 1.2, all TLS 1.2 related provisions in clause 4.2.2 shall apply.

For DTLS 1.3, all TLS 1.3 related provisions in clause 4.2.2 shall apply.

Certificate Profile

Certificate profile defined in clause 4.2.3 shall apply.

IPSec

Overview

O-RAN and 3GPP interfaces that implement authentication, confidentiality and integrity using IPsec shall support IPsec according to [27]. The supported IPsec capabilities in this clause follow [20] for interworking purposes and further apply requirements given in [26], [28], and [29].

Supported IPsec capabilities

Services that SHALL be supported (see also [29], section 9.8.2):

Confidentiality, can be enabled/disabled (via ENCR_NULL)

integrity protection, always enabled

data origin authentication, always enabled

anti-replay protection, can be enabled/disabled

extended sequence numbers, can be enabled/disabled

Protocol that SHALL be supported: ESP ([31], as profiled by [20])

IPsec mode: Tunnel mode

Copying the DSCP value from the inner IP-header to the outer IP-header for encrypted packets

for encrypted packets the DSCP value of the inner packet will be copied to the outer packet

NAT traversal

ESP encryption transforms that SHALL be supported (including authenticated encryption transforms, see also [20], section 5.3.3). ESP authentication transforms that SHALL be supported according to [20], subsection 5.3.4.

IKE endpoint Identification that SHALL be supported, according to [26], subsection 6.2.1b: IP address

 Fully Qualified domain name (FQDN) (if DNS is supported

Authentication that SHALL be supported:

X.509v3 digital certificates provided by a Certificate Authority solution

Authentication that MAY be supported:

Pre-shared Keys

NOTE: Pre-shared keys should not be used.

Key exchange that SHALL be supported:

IKEv2 [33] profile as described in [26]

certificate-based authentication according to [26]

certificates according to the profile described by [26]

DH group 19

(Optional) DH group 20

Security Association multiplicity that SHALL be supported:

multiple IKE SAs (multiple IPsec tunnels)

multiple IPsec SAs

multiple IPsec SAs per IPsec tunnel

IKE SA(s) and IPSEC SA(s) SHALL be regularly re-established.

When the full sequence number space of an IPSEC SA(s) is used, the transmission for that SA SHALL stop.

4.5.1.1.10 Dead-Peer-Detection (DPD) SHALL be supported as defined in [34].Each node SHALL support a traffic narrowing function for the traffic selector ([34]): If the traffic selector notified from the peer (e.g. Security GW or neighbouring node) is wider than the Local/Remote Address range in the SPD information set on the node side, the peers set the traffic selector values to the narrower range.

Parallel usage of IPsec and other secure transport protocols

Implementations SHALL support IPSec configuration with one or more dedicated connections in parallel with other secure transport protocols.

EXAMPLE: It should be possible to run SSH or TLS connections within an IPsec tunnel or in parallel to IPsec tunnel(s).

Responder mode and Initiator/Responder mode support

Implementations SHALL support a configurable option per IKE Security Association to use "Responder mode" instead of "Responder/Initiator mode".

 Responder mode is applied to IKE SA establishment only. The introduction of "Responder mode" does not change the IKE SA rekeying behavior: Each node shall be able to operate as initiator and responder in IKE_SA rekeying.

CMPv2

Certificate Management Protocol version 2 (CMPv2) is based on Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) specified in IETF RFC 4210 [38] and 4211 [39].

3GPP TS 33.310 [26] specifies the use of CMPv2 used by base stations to obtain an operator-signed certificate using a secured communication based on the vendor-signed certificate in the base station and a vendor root certificate pre-installed in the CA/RA server.

Certificates may be installed at initial system initialization or obtained through certificate enrolment with the operator’s PKI. Certificate enrolment may be supported with the CMPv2 protocol between the Network Element (NE) and the operator’s CA as defined in 3GPP TS 33.310 [26]. A PNF that supports CMPv2 shall use the CMPv2 profile defined in 3GPP TS 33.310 [26], clause 9.5. The CA/RA server may include the trust anchor for the operator issued certificate and the appropriate certificate chains in the initialization response message.

OAuth 2.0

Overview

The authorization framework described in clause 4.7 of the present document uses the OAuth 2.0 framework as specified in IETF RFC 6749 [35]. It allows the service producers to authorize the requests from service consumers, and the service consumers to obtain authorization credentials (“token endpoint”).

Interfaces requiring the use of OAuth 2.0 for authorization purposes shall support the functionality according to clause 4.7 of the present document.

Following options have been introduced to guarantee interoperability and align with the existing OAuth 2.0 authorization framework in 3GPP [29] (i.e., Service Based Architecture).

Basic Parametrization

General

Client access token authorization grants shall be supported with type Client Credentials Grant, as described in 4.4 of IETF RFC 6749 [35]. Mutual TLS authentication, as specified in the present document (clause 4.2.1), is the mechanism selected by O-RAN for this security procedure.

In addition, still aligned with Client Credential Grant as described in section 4.4. of IETF RFC 6749 [35], Client Id and Client Secret may be supported for client authentication. In this case, one-way TLS may be used (certificate on server side).

Access tokens shall be JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as described in IETF RFC 7519 [36] and shall be secured with digital signatures based on JSON Web Signature (JWS) as described in IETF RFC 7515 [37].

The ‘scope’ attribute as described in clause 3.3 of IETF RFC 6749 [35] shall be used to specify the allowed services per type of service producer. A more granular level of authorization may be defined by adding additional scope information with the token (e.g., to authorize specific operations, or access to particular resources or datasets), which requires to be verified by the service producer.

OAuth 2.0 roles, as defined in clause 1.1 of IETF RFC 6749 [35], are as follows:

OAuth 2.0 Authorization server: new security function in O-RAN architecture; or provided by existing OAuth 2.0 infrastructure in the network.

OAuth 2.0 client: every API service consumer in O-RAN system (e.g., rApp, xApps)

OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server: every API service producer in O-RAN system (e.g., Near-RT RIC platform)

Registration process

OAuth 2.0 resource servers (API service producers) shall be registered with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization server. Service producers may include additional scope information related to specific allowed service operations and resources per client type.

Before initiating the authorization protocol, OAuth 2.0 clients shall be registered with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization server. To achieve that, information about the service consumer instance and its type shall be made available in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization server. The registration process is subject to implementation procedures of the operator, with the following consideration on authentication procedure:

OAuth 2.0 clients shall be capable to authenticate securely with the authorization server and client type shall be “confidential” as specified in clause 2.1 of IETF RFC 6749 [35].

Strong authentication mechanisms based on digital certificates shall be supported.

In addition, client authentication mechanism based on client Id and Client Secret may be supported.

Access Token request process

Introduction

	After TLS mutual authentication procedure between the OAuth 2.0 client and OAuth 2.0 Authorization server, or one-way TLS authentication with server certificate and client authentication based on Client Id and Client Secret has been executed, the Authorization server exposes a ‘Token Endpoint’ where the Access Token request service can be requested by OAuth 2.0 client.

	The following procedure depicts the procedure of the OAuth 2.0 client to obtain an access token from the OAuth 2.0 authorization server.

Figure 4.7.2.31: Access Token request process

	The OAuth 2.0 Client shall request an access token from the OAuth 2.0 Authorization server. For this operation the client shall send a HTTP POST request to the authorization server (‘Token endpoint’), as described in IETF RFC 6749 [35], clause 3.2. The message, i.e., the body of the HTTP POST request, shall include the identifier of the client instance making the request, the ‘scope’ parameter indicating the expected services, and optionally additional scope information with more granular information about resources and operations on the resources, and optionally the type of client (‘confidential’) and the expected OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server. The message may include as well information referring to instance(s) of specific resource owner(s)/server(s) if required.

Server requirements

	The OAuth 2.0 Authorization server shall verify that the input parameters in the access token (e.g., client type) match with the corresponding ones in the public certificate of the client, or those in the client profile previously registered.

	If the client is authorized, the Authorization server shall generate an access token with appropriate scope as defined in clause 3.3 of IETF RFC6749[35] included.

	The Authorization server shall digitally sign the generated access token based on a private key as described in IETF RFC 7515 [37]. If the client is not authorized, the Authorization server shall not issue an access token to that client. If the authorization is successful, the Authorization server shall send the access token to the client (‘200 OK’), otherwise it shall reply based on OAuth 2.0 error response defined in IETF RFC 6749 [35].

	The success response should include in addition the expiration time for the token as indicated in IETF RFC 6749 [35].

	The response shall include information to identify the resource owner(s)/server(s) if they differ from the related information included in the token request.

Service access request based on token verification

	Once the client is in possession of a valid access token, it may proceed with the request of service access towards the service producer (OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server).

Figure 4.7.2.41: Service access request based on token verification

The OAuth 2.0 client requests service from the OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server. The OAuth 2.0 client shall include the access token in the request. The OAuth 2.0 client and OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server shall authenticate each other via mutual TLS, as defined in the present document (clause 4.2.1) In addition, one-way TLS authentication with certificate only on server side may be supported, as defined in the clause 4.2.1.

The OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server shall verify the token:

It ensures the integrity of the token by verifying the signature using the OAuth 2.0 Authorization server’s public key.

If the integrity check is successful, the OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server shall verify the claims.

If the verification is successful, the OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server shall execute the requested service and respond back to the OAuth 2.0 client. Otherwise, it shall send a proper error response. If the HTTP protocol is used, that error response shall be based on the OAuth 2.0 error response defined in IETF RFC 6749 [35].

OAuth2.0 Access token API for O-RAN Elements and interfaces

Introduction

This API allows the API Consumer to request an access token based on the procedures for "Access Token request process" as defined in clause 4.7.2.3.

The API version number format shall follow the definitions in clause 4.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [77]. The MAJOR version field shall be 1, the MINOR version field shall be 0 and the PATCH version field shall be 0. Consequently, the <apiVersion> URI path segment shall be set to "v1".

The API is under development and consequently the API version shall include the pre-release version "alpha.1".

For the general token endpoint for O-RAN RESTful service APIs, the URI structure should follow the provisions specified below, with the <apiName> resource URI variable set to "oauth2".

The resources and methods overview of the access token API are addressed in Table 4.7.3.11 and shown in Figure 4.7.3.11.

Figure 4.7.3.21: Access Token Request and Response

The API Consumer sends an HTTP POST request to Authorization Server to request the access token from the Token Endpoint.

The Authorization Server authenticates the client as specified in clause 4.4.2 of IETF RFC 6749 [35] and validates the request as implied in clause 4.4.3 of IETF RFC 6749 [35].

On success, the Authorization Server returns a “200 OK” HTTP response along with an access token response structure.

On failure, the Authorization Server returns a “400 Bad Request” HTTP response and the message content contains additional error information.

Resource Standard Methods

The POST method and its request and response parameters are specified in IETF RFC 6749 [35].

This information is reproduced using the O-RAN scheme for RESTful API definitions below, with the request data structure represented in Table 4.7.3.2.1-1, the response data structures and response codes represented in Table 4.7.3.2.1-2 and the HTTP headers represented in Table 4.7.3.2.1-3.

Figure 4.7.3.31: Service request using access token

The API Consumer shall access the protected resources by using access token for the service API being invoked as shown in Figure 4.7.3.2-1. The access token shall be included in the request as an HTTP header field as specified in clause 2.1 of IETF RFC 6750 [78].

The API Producer shall validate the access token and ensure that it has not expired and that its scope covers the requested resource.

If the token validation is successful, the API Producer shall allow access for the actual resource with the actual request and its parameters. The API Producer shall return the HTTP response as defined for the service API being invoked.

If the token validation fails due to invalid token or expired token, the API Producer shall return "401 Unauthorized" in line with the provisions in clause 3 of IETF RFC 6750 [78].

If the token validation is failed due to insufficient access rights to access the resource, the API Producer shall return “403 Forbidden" in line with the provisions in clause 3 of IETF RFC 6750 [78].

In case of any other error, the API Producer shall return the appropriate error as defined by the service API.

LDAP

General requirements

LDAP, or the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is a widely adopted, unbiased standardized communication protocol that enables the interaction and management of distributed directory data via an IP network. This protocol plays a crucial part in the creation of both intranet and internet applications, as it facilitates the sharing of detailed information about various resources, such as users, systems, networks, services, and applications, across the entire network.

O-RAN interfaces that implement Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) shall:

support LDAP version 3 as specified in [74] and LDAP with StartTLS as specified in[75].

not support previous versions of LDAP.

StartTLS operation shall be initiated prior to any other LDAP operation and all LDAP data shall be sent only after successful establishment of TLS connection. Requirements for TLS in clause 4.2 shall apply.

MACsec

General requirements

The O-RAN interfaces that implement authentication, confidentiality and integrity using MACsec shall support MACsec capabilities according to IEEE Std 802.1AE-2018 [79].

MACsec Profile

The O-RAN interfaces using MACsec shall support the mandatory cipher suites as specified in IEEE Std 802.1AE-2018 [79] clause 14, Table 14-1—MACsec Cipher Suites.

Cryptographic operations

The following table outlines the main cryptographic operations involved in the protection of (1) App/VNF/CNF packages for ensuring their integrity, authenticity and confidentiality (for sensitive artifacts) during delivery, onboarding, and instantiation phases, (2) the communication channel over O-RAN interfaces in terms of authenticity, confidentiality and integrity, and (3) the stored assets within O-RAN system. It contains the allowed list of algorithms, key sizes and standards according to BSI [i.6] and NIST [40], [48], [i.9] cryptographic guidelines.

For ensuring the integrity

of Apps/VNF/CNF packages

The signature operation shall involve X.509-based PKI certificates [74].

The following recommendations should be considered:

For the protection of cryptographic keys, Hardware Security Modules, or HSMs, should be used.

Along with HSMs, the principle of least privilege should be used with keys, to ensure only users who need the key have access to it.

In case a legacy system doesn't support ECDSA, RSA signing algorithms should be used instead. Otherwise, the use of the Elliptic curve signing algorithms is recommended.

If libraries or frameworks are in use that don't support PSS padding scheme, one of the RSA PKCS1 algorithms should be used instead. Otherwise, the use of one of the RSA PSS algorithms is recommended.

In general, the largest key size available for an algorithm family should be used:

For RSA, the largest supported key size is 4096 bits.

For ECDSA, the largest supported key size is 512 bits.

For AES, the largest supported key size is 256 bits.

Secure File Transfer protocols

General

File Transfer management is required in several O-RAN use cases, e.g. for export of log files.

An O-RAN architectural element that implements file management shall support at least one of these secure file transfer protocols: SFTP, FTPES, HTTPS. This is aligned with, for example, how 3GPP specifies File Management in [67] and [68]

SFTP is authenticated with username/password, SSH keys or X.509 certificates.  FTPES is authenticated with X.509 certificates. HTTPS is mutually authenticated with X.509 certificates.

SFTP
