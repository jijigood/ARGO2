      1) typographical corrections in descriptions.
      2) Updates to transmission window control.
      3) Introduces to existing grouping 'endpoint-section-capacity' two new leaf nodes 'max-uplane-section-header-per-symbol' and
          'max-uplane-section-header-per-slot' to limit U-Plane data section header addition/parsing.
      4) deprecated parameter 'max-remasks-per-section-id' since it is duplicate of leaf node 'max-control-sections-per-data-section'.
      5) introduces new leaf nodes 'max-beams-updates-per-slot' and ''max-beams-updates-per-symbol'
           to grouping 'endpoint-beam-capacity'
      6) added new SRS features:

         Specifically, if endpoint is set for delay managed operation (non-time-managed-delay-enabled = FALSE)

         transmission-window-offset, symbol-specific offset from transmission-window-schedules and

         If endpoint is set for non-delay managed operation (non-time-managed-delay-enabled = TRUE)

         Additional restrictions on values (and presence) of transmission-window-schedule, transmission-window-offset

         If INDEPENDENT-TRANSMISSION-WINDOW-CONTROL feature is not supported then all endpoints with

         must be shared (start at the same time and end at the same time) by all the endpoints handling
         same carrier type and SCS. This restriction applies only to endpoints that have transmission
         control enabled.

         If INDEPENDENT-TRANSMISSION-WINDOW-CONTROL feature is supported then restriction described
