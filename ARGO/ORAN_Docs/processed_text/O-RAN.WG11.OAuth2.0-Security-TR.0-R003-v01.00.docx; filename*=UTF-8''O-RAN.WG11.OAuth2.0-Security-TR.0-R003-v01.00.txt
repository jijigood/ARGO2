Foreword

 This Technical Report (TR) has been produced by O-RAN Alliance.

Modal verbs terminology

In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions).

"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.

1	Scope

The technical report defines the authorization framework for O-RAN elements using O-Auth2.0 and applies to the HTTP-based APIs used in the R1, O2, A1 and Y1 interfaces.

For this objective, the present document

Defines the procedure flow for token registration process, token request process, token verification process and token authorization process. It will specify the token scope metadata for O-RAN.

Analyses the existing specifications related to O-Auth2.0 such as O-RAN Security protocol specification, IETF RFC 8705[i.6], IETF RFC 6749[i.5], 3GPP TS29.501[3], 3GPP TS 33.122[i.4] and ETSI NFV SEC-022[i.7]. This is used as input to the present document.

Analyses the security threat arising from the misuse of the access token and defines the security requirements associated to access token.

Provides the study and recommendation of an authorization server architecture to overlay on the O-RAN architecture.

1.1 	Consideration

This Technical Report makes the following considerations:

O-RAN Alliance WG1 has identified the key functions and interface [i.9] adopted in O-RAN and this will influence the set assets to be protected for OAuth2.0 framework.

This TR will perform detail study of OAuth2.0 Authorization server for O-RAN Architecture Elements and interface.

Clause 4.7 in O-RAN Security Protocol Security specification [i.1] will be considered as the baseline text for the OAuth2.0 framework.

The recommended security requirements and controls provided in this report will be shared with the impacted O-RAN Alliance working group, such as WG1, WG2, WG3, WG6 and WG10 prior publishing them as normative.

3	Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

3.1	Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms apply:

A1: Interface between non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC to enable policy-driven guidance of Near-RT RIC applications/functions, and support AI/ML workflow.

Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller: An O-RAN Network Function (NF) that enables near-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained data collection and actions over E2 interface. It may include AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning) workflow including model training, inference and updates.

Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller: A functionality within SMO that drives the content carried across the A1 interface.  It is comprised of the Non-RT RIC Framework and the Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps) whose services are defined below.

Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps): Modular applications that leverage the functionality exposed via the Non-RT RIC Framework’s R1 interface to provide added value services relative to RAN operation, such as driving the A1 interface, recommending values and actions that may be subsequently applied over the O1/O2 interface and generating “enrichment information” for the use of other rApps.  The rApp functionality within the Non-RT RIC enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources and policy-based guidance to the applications/features in Near-RT RIC.

O2: Interface between SMO framework as specified in Clause 5.3.1 and the O-Cloud for supporting O-RAN virtual network functions. Please refer to [13] for more information.

R1 Interface: Interface between rApps and Non-RT RIC Framework via which R1 Services can be produced and consumed.

SMO: A Service Management and Orchestration framework.

xApp: An application designed to run on the Near-RT RIC. Such an application is likely to consist of one or more microservices and at the point of on-boarding will identify which data it consumes and which data it provides. The application is independent of the Near-RT RIC and may be provided by any third party. The E2 enables a direct association between the xApp and the RAN functionality.

Y1: An interface over which RAN analytics services are exposed by the Near-RT RIC to be consumed by Y1 consumers.
