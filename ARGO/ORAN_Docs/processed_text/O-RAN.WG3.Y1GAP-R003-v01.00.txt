RAI	RAN Analytics Information
4	General Aspects
4.1	Reference Model for Y1 interface
As depicted in Figure 4.1-1, the O-RAN architecture [1] allows authorized consumers, which may be O-RAN or 3GPP NFs, to request RAN analytics information from Near-RT RIC via Y1 interface.
Figure 4.1-1: Reference Model for Y1 interface
4.2	Y1 interface general principles
The general principles for the specification of the Y1 interface are as follows:
-	The Y1 interface is an open logical interface that enables services to be accessed by authorized consumers;
-	The Y1 interface enables a multi-vendor environment and is independent of specific implementations of the Near-RT RIC;
-	The Y1 interface is defined in an extensible way that enables new services and data types to be added without needing to change the protocols or the procedures.
4.3	Y1 interface specification objectives
The Y1 interface specifications facilitate the following:
-	inter-connection of Near-RT RIC and Y1 consumers.
5	Y1 services and operations

-	Target entity: Information that identifies the entity to which the RAI is related, such as specific UE(s), slice(s), etc.;
-	Notification target address: the endpoint for receiving the notification(s) associated with the subscription;
-	Notification criteria: indicates the timing or the conditions when the RAI notifications are triggered.

6.2.1	General
Table 6.2.1-1 shows the RAI types provided by Near-RT RIC.
Table 6.2.1-1: RAI types provided by Near-RT RIC
6.2.2	RAN performance analytics
With RAN performance analytics, Near-RT RIC provides statistics or predictions on the RAN performance [2].
In particular, the following parameter values are applicable to a request for this RAI type:

-	Optionally, subset(s) of analytics defined in this RAI type;
7	Y1 interface protocol structure
7.1	General
One or more solutions in terms of network protocol and data interchange format may be supported by Y1 interface. The use of a specific solution by the Near-RT RIC and the Y1 consumer may be pre-configured or negotiated via a proper mechanism.
The solution sets defined for Y1 interface are listed in Table 7.1-1.
Table 7.1-1: Solution sets for Y1 interface
7.2	Solution 1: HTTP REST with JSON
7.2.1	Introduction
The protocol stack of this solution is shown on Figure 7.2.1-1:
-	TCP [3] provides the communication service at the transport layer;
-	TLS [4][5] is used to provide secure HTTP [6] connections;
-	HTTP [6] is used as application-level protocol;
-	The data interchange layer constitutes the transport of documents in the JSON format [7].

7.2.2	Network layer
IPv6 [8] and/or IPv4 [9] may be used as the network layer.
7.2.3	Transport layer
TCP [3] shall be used as transport protocol.
NOTE:		When using TCP as the transport protocol, an HTTP connection is mapped to a TCP connection.
7.2.4	Security
The detailed requirements and protocols for security protection are defined in [12], clauses 5.2.7 and 5.1.3.2.
7.2.5	Application
As application layer, HTTP/1.1 [10] shall be supported, and HTTP/2 [11] should be supported. The HTTP semantics as defined in [6] shall be supported.
HTTP over TLS [6] shall be supported.
HTTP details such as use of standard headers, custom headers, error codes, methods, URIs etc. will be specified in Application Protocols for Y1 interface.
The default TCP port numbers should be used for HTTP operation.
7.2.6	Data interchange
As a data interchange format, JSON [7] shall be supported.
