Deployment Scenarios and White Box Base Station Architecture
This chapter consists of two parts: the deployment scenario and the white box architecture. The deployment scenarios outline more specific functional requirements of the base station. All the reference designs shall meet these requirements in order to comply with O-RAN white box standard. In the white box hardware architecture section, it describes the overall gNB hardware architecture and function partition that meet the design requirements. The details on each of these topics are described in the following sections.
Deployment Scenarios
The indoor picocell is the targeted deployment scenario of this specification. The requirements of the indoor picocell base station are listed in the white box Deployment Scenarios and Base Station Classes document [1]. Some of the key requirements described in that document are highlighted here.
Cell type: Indoor
Carrier Frequency Band: FR1
Frequency Bandwidth: Up to 100 MHz
Inter site distance: 20 meters
Antennas: 2Tx2Rx; 4Tx4Rx
Fronthaul Type: O-RAN FH (WG4), 3GPP Option 6 and 3GPP Option 8
White Box Base Station Architecture
In general, the base station hardware architecture can be classified by using different criteria. The physical partition method is adopted by O-RAN; hence, the base station architecture is divided into three categories namely split, integrated, and all-in-one. In split architecture, the fronthaul interface determines the gNB functions location. Here we refer to the two partitions as O-DUx and O-RUx; where the “x” is split option number. In case the O-RAN WG4 defined fronthaul interface is used, these two partitions are called O-DU7-2 and O-RU7-2. For a more complete description of the terminology used, refer to the Deployment Scenarios and Base Station Classes Document [1].
The split architecture is shown in Figure 2-1. A Fronthaul Gateway (FHGW) is an optional device between the O-DUx and O-RUx to aggregate multiple radio units together. Within this specification, a Back End fronthaul interface is defined as the connection between the FHGWx and the O-DUx, while the Font End fronthaul interface is defined as the connection between the FHGWx and the O-RUx. With split architectures, one may choose to have O-CU and O-DUx as either co-located or shared configuration with respect to hardware.
Figure 2-1: Indoor Split Architecture
For integrated base station architecture, the O-DU is integrated with the O-RU into one box. Figure 2-2 shows the integrated architecture.
Figure 2-2: Indoor Integrated Architecture
The all-in-one architecture is shown in Figure 2-3. This architecture is defined as where O-CU, O-DUx and O-RUx are physically located in one hardware box.
Figure 2-3: Indoor All-In-One Architecture
Split RAN Architecture
For medium and large coverage indoor deployment scenarios, the base station with split RAN architecture is more cost effective. This type of architecture is widely deployed in 4G networks. The main idea of this architecture is “shared cell”. By using the fronthaul gateway, a large number of radio units can then share the same radio spectrum resource in one cell. This configuration is very useful in both low and high capacity scenarios.  Therefore, when an O-DUx and FHGWx are capable of handling cell splits, multiple O-RUx(s) can be grouped together to share the radio resources. Accordingly, the choice of fronthaul split option changes the architecture of the base station. WG7 has recognized the following four split option architectures per service providers’ deployment needs which are shown in Figure 2-4 through Figure 2-7.
Option 6 to option 6 split architecture
In split option 6, the L1 functions are within O-RU6 while the O-DU6 contains functions of MAC and above. Figure 2-4 shows the block diagram of base station having an option 6 split architecture.
Figure 2-4: Option 6 to Option 6 Split Architecture
Option 7-2 to option 7-2 split architecture:
In split option 7-2, low PHY functions reside in the O-RU7-2, while the high PHY functions reside in the O-DU7-2. O-RAN WG4 CUS-plane spec [4] outlines the details of this split option under different usage scenarios.
Figure 2-5: Option 7-2 to Option 7-2 Split Architecture
Option 7-2 to option 8 split:
This configuration is selected when a deployment scenario requires a radio unit which only supports split option 8 architecture.  Since this is currently not part of overall O-RAN architecture, CPRI based option 8 fronthaul and FHGW7-28 will be included in the reference design specification.  Figure 2-6 depicts the option 7-2 to option 8 based split architecture. There is no change for the definition of O-DU7-2, However, O-RU8 supports option 8 fronthaul interface while the FHGW7-28 translates the fronthaul protocol between option 7-2 and CPRI.
Figure 2-6: Option 7-2 to Option 8 Split Architecture
Option 8 to option 8 split architecture:
Currently, Option 8 is a non-O-RAN defined split option where the CPRI fronthaul interface is needed in order to make the interoperability work with O-DU8 and O-RU8 from different vendors. The option 8 fronthaul interface definition and the requirements shall be part of the white box reference design, if adopted. In this case, the O-DU8 consists of L1 and L2 processing functions. Figure 2-7 shows an option 8 based split architecture. Note that O-CU and O-DU8 hardware may be integrated into one Whitebox this is also shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7: Option 8 to Option 8 Split Architecture
Integrated gNB-DU Architecture
For integrated gNB-DU, the complete L1/L2 and radio functions are integrated into a single box which includes all logical functions of O-DU and O-RU.  Figure 2-8 shows the block diagram of integrated gNB-DU. The gNB-DU connects with the O-CU through an F1 interface as defined by 3GPP.
Figure 2-8: Integrated gNB-DU Architecture
All-In-One Base Station Architecture
For all-in-one base station, the functions of O-CU, O-DUx and O-RUx are included in one box which is composed of baseband unit and RF processing unit, as such no FH interface and F1 interface are required to connect them.
Figure 2-9: All-In-One Base Station Architecture
White Box Hardware Architecture
Based on the gNB physical implementation architectures discussed earlier, this chapter provides the architecture, major building blocks and all external/internal interfaces for each Whitebox.
O-CU Hardware Architecture
In 3GPP system architecture, the gNB Central Unit (CU) communicates to the Distribution Unit (DU) via an F1 interface.  This interface has been adopted by O-RAN Alliance as well.  F1 is an IP based protocol interface, which offers more flexibility on O-CU platform design.
O-CU Architecture Diagram
The O-CU can be implemented with any General-Purpose Processor (GPP) based platform having an optional accelerator block. The O-CU functions can be implemented in either a separated hardware platform or share the same hardware platform with O-DUx functions (Integrated).  In both cases, the O-CU should be able to leverage the O-DUx reference design with relaxed requirements on I/O and network bandwidth capacity. Figure 3-1 shows the hardware blocks and interfaces within the O-CU white box. Refers to the O-DUx section for the details of O-CU components and interfaces.
Figure 3-1: O-CU White Box Hardware Block Diagram
O-CU Functional Module Description
The O-CU functional module description is the same as for the O-DU7-2 and it is described in Section 3.2.2.
O-CU Interfaces
The O-CU interfaces are the same as for the O-DU7-2 and it is described in Section 3.2.3.
O-DU7-2 Hardware Architecture
For split RAN architecture, the functional blocks of RAN physical layer are divided into two parts – high PHY and low PHY.  The O-RAN lower layer split is defined in O-RAN WG4 fronthaul interface specification [4]. It also provides the details of the interface protocol as well as function partitions.
O-DU7-2 Architecture Diagram
Depending on the 3GPP standards and category of the radio unit, the split function blocks within O-DU7-2 and O-RU7-2 may vary accordingly. The O-RAN fronthaul C/U/S-plane specification [4] offers comprehensive information on this topic. The hardware functional partition architecture is shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: O-DU7-2 with Split Physical Function
O-DU7-2 Functional Module Description
O-DU7-2 or O-CU hardware components selection is a product design specific task. Figure 3-3 shows the required components of O-DU7-2. Their descriptions and requirements are as follows:
Digital Processing Unit
The processing unit can be any GPP or digital signal processor (DSP), with I/O chipset. It may also be in the form of System-On-Chip (SOC), or Multi-Chip Package (MCP).
Memory
DDR memory devices are used to store the runtime data and software for the processing unit.
Flash Memory

O-DU6 Hardware Architecture
Hardware architecture for base stations deploying architecture with split option 6 are described in the following sections.
O-DU6 Architecture Diagram
O-DU6 and O-RU6 are connected via Ethernet based nFAPI interface[6]. O-RU6 includes complete physical layer processing functions, thus the O-DU6 handles L2 and L3 processing functions. The O-DU6 hardware architecture is shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: O-DU6 Architecture Diagram
O-DU6 Functional Module Description
O-DU6 hardware functional blocks are the same as the modules used by O-DU7-2.  A detailed description of O-DU7-2 modules is given in Section 3.2.2. However, note that O-DU6, does not require an accelerator module since all physical layer functions are handled by O-RU6.
O-DU6 Interfaces
The O-DU6 interfaces are the same as O-DU7-2 interfaces which are described in section 3.2.3.
O-DU8 Hardware Architecture
Base stations deploying split architecture option 8 have their baseband processing and radio processing units physically separated from one another.  For this type of functional partition, CPRI must be used as fronthaul interface between O-DU8 and O-RU8.  The architecture for O-DU8 is described in the following sections
O-DU8 Architecture Diagram
O-DU8 shall contain complete physical layer processing operation. The details of CPRI interface will be provided as part of the reference design if this option is selected by the system designer. The hardware functional partition architecture is shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5: O-DU8 Architecture Diagram
O-DU8 Functional Module Description
Most of hardware modules in O-DU8 are the same as the modules used by O-DU7-2. Section 3.2.2 has the detailed description of those components. The differences between O-DU8 and O-DU7-2 are the fronthaul interface and the physical layer functions that are performed within O-DU8 (i.e., O-DU8 performs all PHY functions vs O-DU7-2 only performs High PHY functions). In O-DU8, CPRI interface is used for fronthaul. Figure 3-6 shows the various components used in O-DU8, and additional functional modules are elaborated in the following:
CPRI Interface Device
This device provides the CPRI protocol used for the fronthaul interface.
