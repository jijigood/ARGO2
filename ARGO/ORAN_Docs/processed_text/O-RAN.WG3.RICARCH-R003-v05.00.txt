6	Near-RT RIC Functional Description
6.1	General
A Near-RT RIC is composed of a Near-RT RIC platform and one or more xApps. An overview in shown in Figure 6.1-1.
Figure 6.1-1 also shows the functionalities of the Near-RT RIC platform. Those functionalities are further described in clause 6.2.
Figure 6.1-1: Near-RT RIC Architecture Overview
6.2	Functionalities of the Near-RT RIC platform
6.2.1	Database and SDL
6.2.1.0	Overview
The database and SDL functionalities enable the Near-RT RIC platform to maintain and expose RAN/UE information and other information required to support specific use cases.
6.2.1.1	UE-NIB
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform to maintain UE related information:
-	Maintaining a list of UEs and associated data;
-	Tracking and correlation of the UE identities associated with the connected E2 Nodes.
Such information may be generated and accessed by the Near-RT RIC platform or authorized xApps.
6.2.1.2	R-NIB
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform to maintain RAN related information:
-	Maintaining the configurations and near real-time information relating to connected E2 Nodes and the mappings between them.
Such information may be generated and accessed by the Near-RT RIC platform or authorized xApps.
6.2.1.3	SDL
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform to provide SDL services for xApps, which can be used to subscribe to database notifications and to read, write and modify information stored on the database. UE-NIB, R-NIB and other use case specific information may be exposed using the SDL services.
6.2.2	xApp Subscription Management
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform to handle subscription requests from different xApps for E2 related data, and provide unified data distribution to xApps for those data:
-	Managing subscriptions from xApps to E2 Nodes;
-	Enforcing authorization of policies controlling xApp access to messages;
-	Enabling merging of identical subscriptions from different xApps into a single subscription toward an E2 Node.
6.2.3	Conflict Mitigation
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform to detect and resolve potentially overlapping or conflicting requests from multiple xApps.
In the context of Near-RT RIC, Conflict Mitigation is about addressing conflicting interactions between different xApps. An application will typically change one or more parameters with the objective of optimizing a specific metric. Conflict Mitigation is necessary because xApps objectives may be chosen/configured such that they result in conflicting actions.
6.2.4	Messaging Infrastructure
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform with low-latency message delivery between Near-RT RIC internal endpoints.
-	It supports registration/discovery/deletion of endpoints:
-	Registration: Endpoints register themselves to the messaging infrastructure;
-	Discovery: Endpoints are discovered by the messaging infrastructure initially and registered to the messaging infrastructure;
-	Deletion: Endpoints are deleted once they are not used anymore.
-	It provides the following APIs:
-	An API for sending messages to the messaging infrastructure;
-	An API for receiving messages from the messaging infrastructure.
-	It supports multiple messaging modes, e.g., point-to-point mode (e.g., message exchange among endpoints), publish/subscribe mode (e.g., real-time data dispatching from E2 termination to multiple subscriber xApps);
-	It provides message routing, namely according to the message routing information, messages can be dispatched to different endpoints;
-	It supports message robustness to avoid data loss during a messaging infrastructure outage/restart or to release resources from the messaging infrastructure once a message is outdated.
6.2.5	Security
The security functionality given in this clause only applies to Near-RT RIC. One of the targets is to prevent malicious xApps from abusing radio network information (e.g., exporting to unauthorized external systems) and/or control capabilities over RAN functions. The security requirements for the 3GPP LTE eNB is defined in [6] and for the 5G NR gNB in [7].
NOTE: 	The description of security functionalities is not included in the release.
6.2.6	Management
6.2.6.1	Void
6.2.6.2	OAM Management of Near-RT RIC
OAM management consists of fault, configuration, accounting, performance, file, security and other management plane services. OAM management follows O1 related management aspects defined in [4].
To support OAM management services, Near-RT RIC platform provides the following capabilities:
-	Fault Management: The Near-RT platform RIC provides Near-RT RIC Fault Supervision MnS over the O1 interface as defined in [4];
-	Configuration management: The Near-RT RIC platform provides Near-RT RIC Provisioning MnS over the O1 interface as defined in [4];
-	Logging: logging is to capture information needed to operate, troubleshoot and report on the performance of the Near-RT RIC platform and its constituent components. Log records may be viewed and consumed directly by users and systems, indexed and loaded into a data storage, and used to compute metrics and generate reports. Near-RT RIC components log events according to a common logging format. Different logs can be generated (e.g., audit log, metrics log, error log and debug log).
-	Tracing: tracing mechanisms are needed to monitor the transactions or a workflow. An example subscription workflow can be broken into two traces namely, a subscription request trace followed by a response trace. Individual traces can be analysed to understand timing latencies as the workflow traverses a particular Near-RT RIC component.
-	Metrics collection: metrics for performance and fault management specific to each xApp logic and other internal functionalities are collected and published for authorized consumer (e.g., SMO). A metrics collection mechanism is needed to collect and report metrics.
6.2.7	Interface Termination
6.2.7.1	E2 Termination
This functionality enables termination of E2 interface with the following:
-	Terminating SCTP connection from each E2 Node;
-	Routing messages from xApps through the SCTP connection to an E2 Node;
-	Decoding the payload of an incoming ASN.1 message enough to determine message type;
-	Handling incoming E2 messages related to E2 connectivity;
-	Receiving and responding to the E2 Setup Request from an E2 Node;
-	Notifying xApps of the list of RAN functions supported by an E2 Node based on information derived from the E2 Setup and RIC Service Update procedures [3];
-	Notifying the newly connected E2 Node of the list of accepted functions.
6.2.7.2	A1 Termination
This functionality enables termination of A1 interface with the following:
-	Providing a generic API by means of which Near-RT RIC can receive and send messages via A1 interface [8]. These include, e.g., A1 policies and enrichment information received from Non-RT RIC, or A1 policy feedback sent towards Non-RT RIC.
-	Sending A1 policy that is set or updated by the Non-RT RIC to suitable xApp(s) based on a list of candidate xApp provided by xApp Repository functionality.
6.2.7.3	O1 Termination
This functionality enables termination of O1 interface.
An implementation of O1 Termination at Near-RT RIC depends on the deployment options described in [4], i.e., when Near-RT RIC is modelled as a stand-alone Managed Element.
Near-RT RIC platform communicates with SMO via O1 interface and exposes O1-related management services [5] from Near-RT RIC. For the O1 management services (MnS) shown below, Near-RT RIC platform is the MnS producer and SMO is the MnS consumer:
-	Exposing provisioning management services from Near-RT RIC to O1 provisioning management service consumer;
-	Translating O1 management services to Near-RT RIC internal APIs;
-	Exposing FM services to report faults and events from Near-RT RIC to O1 FM service consumer;
-	Exposing PM services to report bulk and real-time PM data from Near-RT RIC to O1 PM service consumer;
-	Exposing file management services to download ML files, software files, etc. and upload log/trace files to/from file MnS consumer;
-	Exposing communication surveillance services to O1 communication surveillance service consumer.
6.2.7.4	Y1 Termination
This functionality enables termination of Y1 interface.
It provides support for exposing RAN analytics information from Near-RT RIC to Y1 consumers.
6.2.8	API Enablement
In the context of Near-RT RIC, the Near-RT RIC APIs can be categorized based on the interaction with the Near-RT RIC platform and can be related to E2-related services, A1-related services, Management related services, and SDL services.
This functionality provides support for registration, discovery and consumption of Near-RT RIC APIs within the Near-RT RIC scope. In particular, the API enablement services include:
-	Repository / Registry services for the Near-RT RIC APIs;
-	Services that allow discovery of the registered Near-RT RIC APIs;
-	Services to authenticate xApps for use of the Near-RT RIC APIs;
-	Services that enable generic subscription and event notification;
-	Means to avoid compatibility clashes between xApps and the services they access.
The API enablement services can be accessed by the xApps via one or more enablement APIs.
NOTE: 	The provided enablement APIs may need to consider the level of trust related to the xApp (e.g., 3rd party xApp, RIC-owned xApp, etc.).
6.2.9	AI/ML Support
6.2.9.0	Introduction
The AI/ML support functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform with data pipelining, model management, training and inference, which constitute complete AI/ML workflow support for xApps to implement AI/ML algorithms. xApps may use none, part, or all of this functionality, depending on its design.
6.2.9.1	Data Pipelining
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform with data ingestion and preparation for xApps.
The input may include E2 node data collected over E2 interface, enrichment information over A1 interface, information from xApps, and data retrieved from the Near-RT RIC database through the messaging infrastructure.
The output is data sets that are ready to be consumed by AI/ML Model. The output may be stored in an xApp specific space (e.g., a dedicated space in database) or used as input for inference (see clause 6.2.9.3).
6.2.9.1A	Model Management
The Near-RT RIC platform offers storage, retrieval, and version control of AI/ML models for xApps. The Near-RT RIC platform may store the generated model in an xApp specific space (e.g., a dedicated space in database), and tracks the version change of the model if the model is retrained or updated later.
6.2.9.2	Training
This functionality training of AI/ML Models for xApps within Near-RT RIC [i.2]. The Near-RT RIC platform provides generic and use case-independent capabilities to AI/ML-based xApps that may be useful to multiple use cases. The associated AI/ML models are managed by the Near-RT RIC platform (see clause 6.2.9.1A). The input data for training may come from an xApp specific space (e.g., dedicated space in database).
6.2.9.3	Inference
Near-RT RIC platform offers inference of AI/ML Models for xApps. The associated AI/ML models are managed by the Near-RT RIC platform (see clause 6.2.9.1A). The input data may be the output of data pipelining, or come from an xApp specific space (e.g., a dedicated space in database). The inferred result may be provided to the requesting xApp or stored in an xApp specific space (e.g., a dedicated space in database).
6.2.10	xApp Repository Function
This functionality enables the Near-RT RIC platform with the following:
-	Maintaining a list of candidate xApp(s) to A1 Termination for sending A1 policy or policy update to suitable xApp(s) based on policy type and operator policies;
-	Maintaining the policy types supported in Near-RT RIC. The supported policy types are based on policy types supported by the registered xApps and operator policies;
-	Performing xApp access control to requested A1-EI type based on operator policies.
6.3	xApps
The xApps collaborate with the Near-RT RIC platform to support various specialized use cases.
Upon registration to the Near-RT RIC platform, an xApp informs the Near-RT RIC platform of its OAM and control information to enable relevant functionalities.
NOTE: 	The LCM of xApp is performed by SMO and O-Cloud as specified in [4] and [20].
6A	Services of Near-RT RIC platform and xApps

7	Near-RT RIC APIs
7.1	Overall Description
7.1.1	Introduction
The Near-RT RIC APIs are a collection of well-defined interfaces providing Near-RT RIC platform and xApp services. These APIs need to explicitly define the possible types of information flows and data models. The Near-RT RIC APIs are essential to host 3rd party xApps in an inter-operable way on different Near-RT RIC platforms.
Near-RT RIC provides the following Near-RT RIC APIs for xApps:
-	A1 related APIs: APIs to access A1 related services;
-	E2 related APIs: APIs to access E2 related services;
-	Management APIs: APIs to access management related services;
-	SDL APIs: APIs to access Shared Data Layer related services;
-	Enablement APIs: APIs to access enablement services.
7.1.2	Near-RT RIC API approaches
Near-RT RIC APIs may be implemented using two approaches:
-	Network API approach: Each relevant Near-RT RIC endpoint exposes a network endpoint and specifies a particular data encoding protocol and a network transport protocol that should be used to communicate with it. A different network API may be specified for each Near-RT RIC API reflecting a trade-off between different service requirements.
-	SDK approach: The Near-RT RIC vendor provides an SDK (software development kit). This SDK is a software library which handles all connection management and exposes a simple API for the xApp to interact with the Near-RT RIC. The interface between the SDK library embedded in the xApp and the Near-RT RIC Platform may be either vendor proprietary or aligned to the specified Network API.
Both approaches use similar methodologies of interaction with Near-RT RIC as defined in clauses 6A and 9. Furthermore, the detailed messages and IEs for each Near-RT RIC API that the xApp will use largely stay the same in the two approaches.
These two approaches are presented in figure 7.1.2-1 for the Network API approach and figure 7.1.2-2 for the SDK approach.
Both approaches assume that the Near-RT RIC platform provides appropriate support services. These services, labelled “Network API support” and “SDK support” respectively in figures 7.1.2-1 and 7.1.2-2, may be integrated into other platform services (i.e., A1 Termination may provide the support services for A1 related APIs) or implemented as independent services.

Figure 7.1.2-2: Near-RT RIC platform supporting RIC APIs using SDK approach
7.1.3	Network API approach
A Network API is defined in terms of a protocol stack including the definition:
-	An application layer protocol used to carry a set of messages which normally contain multiple Information Elements (IEs);
-	A data encoding protocol (ASN.1, Protobuf, JSON, etc.);
-	A network transport protocol (SCTP, HTTPS, gRPC, etc.);
-	Associated security and encryption methods.
For the Network API approach for Near-RT RIC APIs it is expected that each case listed in clause 7.1.1 may require a unique protocol stack definition which offers an optimal solution balancing the trade-offs between service requirements, Near-RT RIC platform complexity and xApp implementation overheads.
Furthermore, each Network API will require a unique endpoint that the API consumer will need to discover using a combination of configuration and use of the Enablement APIs (also see clause 6A.2.6).
Open O-RAN specified Network APIs for each case listed in clause 7.1.1 are defined in terms of the corresponding protocol stack.
7.1.4	SDK approach
An SDK (Software development Kit) is defined as a set of software tools/libraries provided by platform vendors which helps developers in building applications on the platform. An SDK simplifies application development by:
-	Providing simple APIs to trigger commonly used functionality;
-	Handling routine management tasks “under the hood”;
-	Providing tools for debugging, building, testing applications.
For the SDK approach for Near-RT RIC APIs, it is expected that a given Near-RT RIC vendor offers an SDK library that provides a language specific implementation of each case listed in clause 7.1.1. This provides a common interface to interact with all the Near-RT RIC endpoints as well as other xApps.
The Near-RT RIC SDK library functionality would include:
-	Discovery of relevant endpoints for and connection to Near-RT RIC platform services and other xApps.
-	Handles all connection management of the xApp with all relevant Near-RT RIC platform endpoints as well as other xApps. This includes:
-	Authentication;
-	Registration;
-	Encryption/Decryption (if required);
-	Failovers if any endpoint crashes.
-	Presents a simple API as function definitions for sending/receiving messages;
-	Provides tools for xApp debugging, building and testing.
These services would be provided by the SDK library and so would not be exposed to the business logic within an xApp.
Open O-RAN specified SDK APIs for each case listed in clause 7.1.1 would need to be defined for each supported programming language.
The actual protocol stack implemented by the SDK library and used to communicate with the SDK support service in the Near-RT RIC platform may be either based on the Network APIs or left not specified and so may be vendor proprietary.
7.1.5	Near-RT RIC API support options
The two approaches to Near-RT RIC APIs are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
For example, an xApp designed to support the Network API approach may be implemented using either an internal SDK library that provides the Network API interface or a direct implementation the Network API interface. Both of these cases are presented in figure 7.1.5-1.

9.3	E2 Related API Procedures
9.3.1	Introduction
The following procedures are described in this clause:
E2AP RIC Functional procedures:
-	RIC Subscription using E2 Related API: E2 Subscription (request, reject, success, failure) and E2 Related API: E2 Guidance (request, response);
-	RIC Subscription Delete using E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete (request, reject, success, failure);
-	RIC Subscription Delete Required using E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete Query (required, accept, decline) and E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete Notification (Deleted);
-	RIC Indication using E2 Related API: E2 Indication (push, failure);
-	RIC Control using E2 Related API: E2 Control (request, reject, success, failure) and E2 Related API: E2 Guidance (request, response).
E2 Guidance related procedures:
-	xApp initiated conflict mitigation using E2 Related API: E2 Guidance (request, response);
-	xApp Subscription Management initiated conflict mitigation using E2 Related API: E2 Guidance (modification);
-	Conflict mitigation related message monitoring using E2 Related API: E2 Guidance (modification);
-	Conflict mitigation initiated conflict mitigation using E2 Related API: E2 Guidance (modification).
Other conflict mitigation related procedures are for future study.
9.3.2	RIC Functional Procedures
9.3.2.1	E2 Subscription procedure
The purpose of the E2 Subscription procedure in the Near-RT RIC is to enable an xApp to request subscriptions for REPORT, INSERT and/or POLICY service(s) from E2 interface, and to ensure that only validated and non-duplicate subscriptions are maintained by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Node and that duplicated E2 Subscription Request messages from xApps are handled gracefully.
This procedure is based on the following assumptions:
-	xApp may obtain guidance from Near-RT RIC Platform (i.e., conflict mitigation processing) to resolve potential conflicts and/or detect partial duplications prior to sending a E2 Subscription Request (see clause 9.3.3.1);
-	xApp has been configured with a trusted xApp ID;
-	Near-RT RIC platform maintains all previous successful RIC Subscriptions towards the E2 Node listed in xApp’s E2 Subscription request and is able to detect duplications and recover E2 Node response messages;
-	Near-RT RIC platform may leverage its conflict mitigation functionality in managing E2 subscriptions (see clause 9.3.3.5);
-	Near-RT RIC platform decides initiation of appropriate E2AP procedure(s), if needed, to fulfil the E2 Subscription request.
-	E2 Request ID is used on E2-related APIs to identify an active RIC subscription. Near-RT Platform maintains the 1:1 mapping between E2 Request ID, used on E2 related APIs, and RIC Request ID, used on E2 interface.
-	Near-RT RIC platform routes requests for E2AP procedure(s) to appropriate E2 interface;
-	Near-RT RIC platform maintains a mapping of active Subscriptions (identified on E2 interface by E2 Node ID and RIC Request ID) of validated xApps. Near-RT RIC platform uses the mapping when sending E2 INDICATION messages to the correct xApp or xApps.
The procedure is initiated by an xApp using E2 Related API: E2 Subscription request for a specific E2 Node. The following outcomes are considered:
-	Request fails following rejection by Near-RT RIC platform and an E2 related API: E2 Subscription response (Reject) is sent to xApp without E2 interface transaction. Response contains Cause (i.e., xApp not authorized to request specific subscription);
-	Request towards a specific E2 Node is handled successfully following acceptance by Near-RT RIC platform but detected as duplicate and so acknowledged with an E2 related API: E2 Subscription response (Success) to xApp for a specific E2 Node without corresponding E2 interface transaction;
-	Request towards a specific E2 Node is handled successfully following acceptance by Near-RT RIC Platform and acceptance by E2 Node and so acknowledged with an E2 related API: E2 Subscription response (Success) to xApp for a specific E2 Node following corresponding E2 interface transaction;
-	Request towards a specific E2 Node fails following acceptance by Near-RT RIC Platform but rejected by E2 Node and so declined using an E2 related API: E2 Subscription response (Failure) to xApp for a specific E2 Node following corresponding E2 interface transaction. Response contains Cause (i.e., Request contents not accepted by E2 Node).

9.3.2.2	E2 Subscription Delete procedure
The purpose of the E2 Subscription Delete procedure in the Near-RT RIC is to ensure that a) only validated RIC Subscription Delete Request messages are issued by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Node; b) deletion requests for duplicated Subscription Requests are handled gracefully.
This procedure is based on the following assumptions:
-	xApp has been configured with a trusted xApp ID;
-	Near-RT RIC platform maintains all active subscriptions towards the E2 Node listed in xApp’s E2 Subscription Delete request and is able to detect when and if the delete request shall result in a corresponding E2 message;
-	Near-RT RIC platform routes the subscription delete requests to an appropriate E2interface;
-	Near-RT RIC platform maintains a mapping of active subscriptions (identified on E2 interface by E2 Node ID and RIC Request ID) of the validated xApps. Near-RT RIC platform uses the mapping when sending RIC INDICATION messages to the correct xApp;
The procedure initiated by an xApp uses E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete to request subscription deletion for a specific E2 Node. The following outcomes are considered:
-	Request fails following rejection by Near-RT RIC platform and an E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete response (Reject) is sent to xApp without E2 interface transaction (i.e., xApp not previously associated with validated subscription);
-	Request succeeds following acceptance by Near-RT RIC platform but other subscriber(s) detected for the subscription, and an E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete response (Success) is sent to xApp without corresponding E2 transaction;
-	Request succeeds following acceptance by Near-RT RIC platform and accepted by E2 Node, and an E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete response (Success) is sent to xApp following corresponding E2 transaction;
-	Request fails following acceptance by Near-RT RIC platform but rejected by E2 Node, and an E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete response (Failure) is sent to xApp following corresponding E2 interface transaction (i.e., RIC Request ID is not known by E2 Node);

9.3.2.2A	E2 Subscription Delete Query procedure and E2 Subscription Delete Notification procedure
The purpose of the E2 Subscription Delete Query procedure and E2 Subscription Delete Notification Procedure in the Near-RT RIC is to ensure that deletion request of the existing subscriptions from an E2 Node is handled properly.
The two procedures are based on the following assumptions:
-	The Near-RT RIC platform maintains the list of xApps associated with the subscription removal request from an E2 Node and, if decides to accept, uses the E2 related API: E2 Subscription Delete Notification (Deleted) to delete subscriptions toward xApps. Prior to determining whether or not to accept the subscription delete required request, the Near-RT RIC platform may send E2 related API: E2 Subscription Delete Query (required) to each xApp with an active subscription, each xApp may respond with E2 related API: E2 Subscription Delete (accept) or E2 related API: E2 Subscription Delete (decline).The procedures may be initiated by theNear-RT RIC platform, when RIC Subscription Delete Required is received from an E2 Node. The Near-RT RIC platform may use the E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete Query (required) to consult xApps. The following outcomes are considered:
-	xApp accepts request to delete subscription and sends E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete Query (accept) to accept subscription deletion.
-	xApp declines request to delete subscription and sends E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete Query (decline) to inform Near-RT RIC platform.
In both cases, the Near-RT RIC platform may decide whether to delete the subscription.
The Near-RT RIC platform may also decide whether to delete the subscription without consulting xApps.
If the Near-RT RIC platform decides to delete the subscription, it uses E2 Related API: E2 Subscription Delete Notification (Deleted) to inform each xApp for the eventual outcome.

-	Near-RT RIC platform maintains a list for each E2 Node of validated xApps and the corresponding assigned E2 Request ID and E2 Action ID(s) associated with an E2 node ID, RIC REQUEST ID and RIC Action ID(s);
-	E2 related API ensures delivery of E2 Indication messages from Near-RT RIC platform to all validated xApp;
-	Near-RT RIC platform may support distribution of messages to multiple destinations.
The following outcomes are considered:
-	Message is received, using E2 related API: E2 Indication (push), and successfully processed by xApp;
-	Message is received, using E2 related API: E2 Indication (push), but an error is detected by the xApp and so declined using an E2 related API: E2 Indication (failure) from xApp for a specific E2 Node, E2 Request ID, E2 Action ID and E2 Indication SN.

9.3.2.4	E2 Control procedure
The purpose of the E2 Control procedure in the Near-RT RIC is to ensure that only authorized xApp may initiate RIC Control Request messages issued by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Node.
This procedure is based on the following assumptions:
-	xApp may obtain guidance from Near-RT RIC platform to resolve potential conflicts prior to sending a E2 Control Request (see clause 9.3.3.1);
-	xApp has been configured with a trusted xApp ID;
-	Near-RT RIC platform may be configured to route E2 Control Request messages for a E2 node from xApp either to trigger conflict mitigation for acceptance or directly towards an appropriate E2interface;
-	Near-RT RIC platform ensures that only authorized xApp may send E2 Control Request messages to appropriate E2 interface;
-	Near-RT RIC platform ensures that it systematically forwards any received RIC Control Response or RIC Control Failure to appropriate xApp.
The procedure is initiated by an xApp using E2 Related API: E2 Control request to send a request of a RIC Control for an E2 Node. The following outcomes are considered:
-	Request successful following acceptance by Near-RT RIC platform and accepted by E2 Node and so an E2 Related API: E2 Control response (Success with outcome) is sent to xApp following corresponding E2 transaction;
-	Request fails following acceptance by Near-RT RIC platform but rejected by E2 Node and so an E2 Related API: E2 Control response (Failure with cause) is sent to xApp following corresponding E2 interface transaction (i.e., Request contents is are compliant);
-	Request rejected by Near-RT Platform and so an E2 Related API: E2 Control response (Reject) is sent to xApp (i.e., rejected due to conflict mitigation).

The purpose of the xApp initiated E2 Guidance request/response API procedure in the Near-RT RIC is to allow authorized xApp to obtain guidance from the Near-RT RIC platform (with the conflict mitigation functionality) prior to initiating an action.
Guidance from Near-RT RIC platform may include:
-	Indication on whether or not the xApp proposed E2 Related API message or series of messages may result in a conflict with E2 related API messages from other xApps;
-	Recommendations on how the proposed E2 Related message or series of messages should be modified to avoid conflict;
-	Modification of previous guidance to other xApps and/or Near-RT RIC platform internal processes.
This procedure is based on the following assumptions:
-	xApp may use E2 Related API to obtain guidance from Near-RT RIC platform to resolve potential conflicts prior to initiating a RIC function procedure;
-	xApp may use Near-RT RIC platform response in a subsequent procedure (i.e., for a RIC Functional Procedure).
This procedure is initiated by an xApp using E2 Related API: E2 Guidance request. The following outcomes are considered:
-	Near-RT RIC Platform provides guidance to requesting xApp using E2 Related API: E2 Guidance response;
-	Near-RT RIC Platform provides modified guidance to another xApp and/or its internal processes.

9.4	Management API Procedures
9.4.1	xApp Registration procedure
This procedure registers the xApp to the Near-RT RIC platform so that it can be managed by the SMO via the Near-RT RIC platform. When the xApp is deployed, it will register itself as a managed application to the Near-RT RIC platform by passing the relevant info through the API. Relevant info may include the xApp name, vendor, software version, YANG schemas for configuration management, faults raised, metrics generated, ports for messaging, supported commands (e.g., health check, aliveness probe) and other information needed by the Near-RT RIC platform and/or the SMO for managing the xApp.
In response to an xApp Registration, Near-RT RIC platform performs the following:
-	Authenticates the xApp;
-	Validates that this xApp can run on this Near-RT RIC platform; e.g., RIC has the capacity;
-	Assigns an ID to the xApp;
-	Creates an xApp Managed Object Instance (MOI) in the Near-RT RIC Config DB and populates it with the relevant information passed from the xApp;
-	Sends a Notify MOI Creation to SMO if subscribed.

This procedure removes the MOI for an an xApp when an edit-config delete request is received from the SMO over the O1 interface. See [5] clause 2.1.3. The SMO sends the deleteMOI request via a NETCONF command over the O1 to the Near-RT RIC platform. The Near-RT RIC platform may optionally take the xApp out of service sending a confirmation of the state change before the MOI gets deleted. Once the MOI is deleted, the Near-RT RIC platform sends a NETCONF response confirming the success or failure to the MnS Consumer (SMO).

The O1 Interface supports the 3GPP “getAlarmList”. The Alarm list for the xApps is maintained on the Near-RT RIC. 
The xApp can notify the Near-RT RIC platform of a detected fault. Each xApp shall maintain a list of any faults that are active. These faults are notified to the Near RT RIC platform where the necessary Alarms are created.
The SMO (consumer) may need to verify which alarms are currently active and so may request that the Near-RT RIC (producer) provides an updated list of Alarms. In order to verify that its Alarm list correctly reflects the state of faults at the xApp, the Near RT RIC platform can request an updated list of faults from the xApp.

9.5.9	SDL API data structures
9.5.9.1	Overview
SDL API data structures are used to inform xApps of change to E2 Node state and information as the result of E2AP Global Procedures.
The following data structures are defined:
-	E2NodeList: List of known E2 Node ID and the associated E2 Node State
-	E2NodeInfo: E2 Node component configuration list and RAN function list
The relationship between these data structures and E2AP Global Procedures is described in table 9.5.9.1-1.
Table 9.5.9.4-2 presents the actions that xApp may perform under different E2 Node State conditions.
NOTE 1: 	E2AP Error Indication procedure does not result in a change to SDL API data as most error cases are assumed to be handled internally within the Near-RT RIC platform. An appropriate E2 Related API (Failure, Cause) message may be used to inform xApp if required.
NOTE 2: 	E2AP Reset procedure handling is assumed to be assisted by an appropriate platform mechanism with the Near-RT RIC first using the appropriate SDL API mechanism (see clause 9.5.8) to inform xApp that a RESET has occurred (i.e., E2 Node State = "Reset") and then a second SDL API mechanism is used to inform xApp that the E2 Node is again available (i.e. E2 Note State = "Connected"). It is assumed that the Near-RT RIC platform will delete all associated subscription records during the period between these two SDL API mechanisms and that xApp will use the information E2 Node is again available (i.e., E2 Note State = "Connected") to trigger any required E2 Subscription (Request) messages to re-establish E2 subscriptions.
NOTE 3: 	E2AP E2 Removal procedure handling and E2 link failure handling are assumed to be assisted by an appropriate platform mechanism with the Near-RT RIC using the appropriate SDL API mechanism (see clause 9.5.8) to inform xApp that the E2 Node is not available (i.e., E2 Node State = "Disconnect").
Table 9.5.9.1-1: SDL API handling of E2AP Global procedures
Table 9.5.9.1-2: Expected xApp responses to E2 Node State
9.5.9.2	E2NodeList
The E2NodeList data structure contains a list of known E2 Nodes and the associated E2 Node State. Each record contains:
-	E2 Node ID
-	E2 Node State ("Connected", "Reset", "Disconnected")
E2NodeList records may be deleted when the corresponding E2NodeInfo record has been deleted. It is recommended to maintain this record for sufficient time for all xApps to complete clean-up mechanisms.
9.5.9.3	E2NodeInfo
The E2NodeInfo data structure contains information on a given E2 Node. Each record contains:
-	E2 Node ID
-	List of declared E2 Node component configuration information
-	List of declared RAN Functions
E2NodeInfo records shall be deleted after corresponding E2NodeState is set to "Disconnected" and sufficient time has been allowed for all xApps to complete clean-up mechanisms.

Annex A (informative):
Potential conflict types among xApps for RRM optimization
The control target of the radio resource management can be a cell, a UE or a bearer, etc. The control contents of the radio resource management can cover access control, bearer control, handover control, QoS control, resource assignment and so on. The control time span indicates the valid control duration which is expected by the control request. The conflicts of control can be illustrated as below.
1)	Direct Conflicts: The conflicts can be observed directly by Conflict Mitigation. Some cases are described as below:
-	Two or more xApps request different settings for the very same configuration of one or more parameters of a Control Target. Conflict mitigation processes the requests and decides on a resolution.
-	The new request from an xApp may conflict with the running configuration resulting from a previous request of another or the same xApp.
-	The total requested resources from different xApps may exceed the limitation of the RAN system, e.g., the sum of resources required by the two different xApps may be far beyond the resource limitation of the RAN system.
2)	Indirect Conflicts: The conflicts cannot be observed directly, nevertheless, some dependence among the parameters and resources that the xApps target can be observed. Conflict Mitigation may anticipate the possible conflicts and take actions to mitigate them. For instance, different xApps target different configuration parameters to optimize the same metric according to the respective objective. Even though this will not result in conflicting parameter settings, it may have uncontrollable or inadvertent system impacts. One example of such indirect conflicts can occur when the changes required by one xApp create a system impact which is equivalent to a parameter change targeted by another xApp. E.g., antenna tilts and measurement offsets are different control points, but they both impact the handover boundary.
3)	Implicit Conflicts: The conflicts cannot be observed directly, even the dependence between xApps is not obvious. For instance, different xApps may optimize different metrics and (re-)configure different parameters. Nonetheless, optimizing one metric may have implicit, unwanted, and maybe adversary side effects on one of the metrics optimized by another xApp. E.g., protecting throughput metrics for GBR users may degrade non-GBR metrics or even cell throughput.
For mitigating these conflicts, different approaches exist:
1)	Direct conflicts typically can be mitigated by pre-action coordination, i.e., the xApps or a Conflict Mitigation component needs to make the final determination on whether any specific change is made, or in which order the changes are applied.
2)	Indirect conflicts can be resolved by post-action verification. Here, the actions are executed and the effects on the target metric are observed. Based on the observations, the system has to decide on potential corrections, e.g., rolling back one of the xApp actions.
3)	Implicit conflicts are the most difficult to mitigate since these dependencies are difficult or impossible to observe and therefore hard to model in any mitigation scheme. In some cases, it may be possible to design around such conflicts by ensuring that use cases (xApps) target different parameters, thus falling back to approach 2), but preferably, a generic approach to managing such conflicts is established.
The individual xApp goals are defined by A1 policies, but it is also important to define utility metrics that incorporate the relative importance of each of the metrics targeted by the xApps as well as the importance of the optimization (use case). A Conflict Mitigation function may also use ML approaches, e.g., Reinforcement Learning, to a-priori assess, for each proposed change, the likely probability of degrading a metric versus the potential improvement.
