3.1	Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms [given in [i.1] and the following] apply:

Carrier Frequency:  Center frequency of the cell.

F1 interface:  The open interface between O-CU and O-DU defined by 3GPP TS 38.473.

Frequency Band: A designated frequency range for the operation of the base station and the UE radios. 5G NR frequency bands are divided into two different frequency ranges: Frequency Range 1 (FR1) that mainly includes sub-6GHz frequency bands, some of which are bands traditionally used by previous standards but has been extended to cover potential new spectrum offerings from 410MHz to 7125MHz; Frequency Range 2 (FR2) that includes frequency bands from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz. Bands in this millimeter wave range have shorter range but higher available bandwidth than bands in the FR1.

Frequency Range: It refers to bandwidth defined by the frequency range within which the Base Station can be operated, defined by the band-pass filter of the BS; e.g., 3.4 – 3.8 GHz (400 MHz).

Occupied Bandwidth (OBW): It refers to the bandwidth occupied by the base station when operated, defined by the sum of the active bandwidths of the band allocation(s) operated. As defined by 3GPP TS 34.121 section 5.8, occupied bandwidth is the bandwidth containing 99% of the total integrated power of the transmitted spectrum, centered on the assigned channel frequency. The bandwidth between the 0.5% power frequency points is the occupied bandwidth.

Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW): It refers to the bandwidth in which all frequency components can be simultaneously analyzed. It is defined by the frequency boundaries of the operating band(s).

Fronthaul Gateway (FHGW): A fronthaul gateway is a physical entity that is located between a distributed unit and one or more radio units where it distributes, aggregates, and/or converts fronthaul protocols between the distributed unit and multiple radio units.

gNB:	A RAN node providing NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards the UE, and connected via the NG interface to the 5GC
