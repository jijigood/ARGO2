Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by O-RAN Alliance.

Modal verbs terminology

In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions).

"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.

Scope

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:

Release xx.yy.zz

where:

xx	the first two-digit value is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e., technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document shall have xx=01).

yy	the second two-digit value is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.

zz	the third two-digit value is included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process; externally published documents never have this third two-digit value included.

The present document specifies the transport protocols for R1 services. It is part of a TS-family covering the O-RAN WG2: R1 interface specifications.

Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

3.1	Terms

None defined in this version of the document.

3.2	Symbols

one defined in this version of the document.

3.3	Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in "O-RAN TS R1GAP"[11] and the following apply:

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

TLS: Transport Layer Security

Transport protocols for R1 Services

4.1	General

The R1 interface is defined between the rApps and the Non-RT RIC framework, as defined in O-RAN TS R1GAP [11].

REST based protocol stack

5.1 	General

The layers of the protocol stack for the R1 interface are described in the following chapters:

TCP [2] provides the communication service at the transport layer,

TLS [4][10] is used as specified in clause 4.2 of O-RAN TS SPS [13] to provide secure HTTP  [17] [18] connections,

HTTP [16] [17] [18] is used as application-level protocol,

The data interchange layer constitutes the transport of documents in the JSON format [8].

Figure 5.1-1illustrates the REST based protocol stack for the R1 interface.

Figure 5.1-1: R1 REST Protocol Stack

5.2	Network layer

R1 may be transported over IPv6 [9] and/or IPv4 [1].

5.3	Transport layer

TCP [2] shall be used as transport protocol.

NOTE:	When using TCP as the transport protocol, an HTTP connection is mapped to a TCP connection.

5.4	Security

The specification of security controls on the R1 interface in clause 5.2.6.2 of O-RAN TS SRS [12] shall be followed.

These security controls refer to the detailed specification of the support and use of TLS v1.2 (IETF RFC 5246 [4]), TLS v1.3 (IETF RFC 8446 [10]), and OAuth2.0 [14] with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (IETF RFC 7519 [15])  in the O-RAN TS SPS [13] .

5.5	Application

As application layer, HTTP/1.1 [17] shall be supported, and HTTP/2 [18] should be supported. The HTTP semantics as defined in IETF RFC 9110 [16] shall be supported.

HTTP over TLS (as defined in IETF RFC 9112 for HTTP/1.1 [17] and in IETF RFC 9113 [18] for HTTP/2) shall be supported.

HTTP details such as use of standard headers, custom headers, error codes, methods, URIs etc. will be specified in   Application Protocols for R1 Services.

The default TCP port numbers should be used for HTTP operation.

5.6	Data interchange

As a data interchange format, JSON [8] shall be supported.
