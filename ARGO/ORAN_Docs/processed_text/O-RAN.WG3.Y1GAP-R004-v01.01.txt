RAI	RAN Analytics Information
4	General Aspects
4.1	Reference Model for Y1 interface
As depicted in Figure 4.1-1, the O-RAN architecture [1] supports authorized consumers, which may be O-RAN or 3GPP NFs, to request RAN analytics information from Near-RT RIC via Y1 interface.
Figure 4.1-1: Reference Model for Y1 interface
4.2	Y1 interface general principles
The general principles for the specification of the Y1 interface are as follows:
-	The Y1 interface is an open logical interface that enables services to be accessed by authorized consumers;
-	The Y1 interface enables a multi-vendor environment and is independent of specific implementations of the Near-RT RIC;
-	The Y1 interface is defined in an extensible way that enables new services and data types to be added without needing to change the protocols or the procedures.
4.3	Y1 interface specification objectives
The Y1 interface shall support the following:
-	inter-connection of Near-RT RIC and Y1 consumers.
5	Y1 services and operations

-	Target entity: Information that identifies the entity to which the RAI is related, such as specific UE(s), slice(s), etc.;
-	Notification target address: the endpoint for receiving the notification(s) associated with the subscription;
-	Notification criteria: indicates the timing or the conditions when the RAI notifications are triggered.

Table 6.2.1-1: RAI types supported on Y1 interface
6.2.2	RAN performance analytics
With RAN performance analytics, Near-RT RIC provides statistics or predictions on the RAN performance [2].
In particular, the following parameter values may be used in a request for this RAI type:
-	RAI type ID: "RAN performance analytics";
-	Target entity: e.g., S-NSSAI(s) or O-RAN UE ID;
-	Filter Parameters:

7	Y1 interface protocol structure
7.1	General
One or more solutions in terms of network protocol and data interchange format may be supported by Y1 interface. The use of a specific solution by the Near-RT RIC and the Y1 consumer may be pre-configured or negotiated via a proper mechanism.
The solution sets defined for Y1 interface are listed in Table 7.1-1.
Table 7.1-1: Solution sets for Y1 interface
7.2	Solution 1: HTTP REST with JSON
7.2.1	Introduction
The protocol stack of this solution is shown on Figure 7.2.1-1:
-	TCP [3] shall be used to provide the communication service at the transport layer;
-	TLS [4][5] shall be supported to provide secure HTTP [6] connections;
-	HTTP [6] shall be used as application-level protocol;
