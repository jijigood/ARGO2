Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the O-RAN Alliance.

Modal verbs terminology

In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions).

"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.

1	Scope

The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows:

version xx.yy.zz

where:

xx:	the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

yy:	the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

zz:	the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

The present document defines O-RAN OAM interface functions and protocols for the O-RAN O1 interface for the Near RT RIC. The document studies the functions conveyed over the interface, including management functions, procedures, operations, and corresponding solutions, and identifies existing standards and industry work that can serve as a basis for O-RAN work.

This document will follow the requirements specification language defined in IETF RFC 2119 [33] updated by RFC 8174 [37].  For consistency requirements are specified using “SHALL” to indicate that the implementation is required.

2	References
