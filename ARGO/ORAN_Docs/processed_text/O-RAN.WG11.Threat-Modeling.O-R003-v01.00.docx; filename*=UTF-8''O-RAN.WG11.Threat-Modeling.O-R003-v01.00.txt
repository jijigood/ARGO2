Definition of terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1], O-RAN [6], [9], [11] and the following apply:

Radio jamming is the deliberate jamming, blocking or creating interference with authorized wireless network. A radio jammer is a transmitter that tunes to the same frequency as the opponents’ receiving equipment and with the same type of modulation, with enough power to override any signal at the receiver.

Radio Sniffing technique helps to decode all sorts of essential network configuration details easily with low-cost software radios. Sniffing information can aid attackers in optimizing and crafting attacks.

RF spoofing refers to transmitting a fake signal meant to pretense as an actual signal.

Y1: An interface over which RAN analytics services are exposed by the Near-RT RIC to be consumed by Y1 consumers.

Y1 consumers: A role played by entities within or outside of the PLMN trust domain that consumes the Y1 services produced by the Near-RT RIC.

Overview

Objective and structure

O-RAN architecture [6] differs significantly from the architecture of 3GPP RAN. It involves introducing new components, interfaces, and technologies, which give rise to new actors (stakeholders) and enable novel business models. Consequently, the attack surface expands considerably, and we anticipate that O-RAN design and deployment will present numerous security challenges and associated risks. These challenges primarily stem from various factors, such as the inclusion of O-RAN specific interfaces and components, the utilization of virtualization/containerization techniques, the incorporation of open-source code, and the capability to support AI/ML models, among other considerations.

Additionally, the O-RAN architecture is being developed using zero trust (ZT) and zero trust architecture (ZTA) principles as described in the NIST Zero Trust Architecture Special Publication [26]. Zero trust is an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Zero trust also assumes that an adversary can always be in the network. According to the publication [26], zero trust is based on the following tenets that can be adapted to the O-RAN architecture. Full descriptions of each tenet can be found in [26].

[ZT-1] All data sources and computing services are considered resources.

[ZT-2] All communication is secured regardless of network location.

[ZT-3] Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.

[ZT-4] Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy—including the observable state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset—and may include other behavioral and environmental attributes.

[ZT-5] The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets. No asset is inherently trusted.

[ZT-6] All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.

[ZT-7] The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.

Therefore, the security analysis and the threat model for O-RAN must be carefully studied and relevant assets/stakeholders/vulnerabilities/threats/requirements/countermeasures/recommendations must be identified to reduce risk exposure, mitigate any harmful effects, and drive to a ZTA.

The material presented in this analysis aims at supporting various O-RAN stakeholders understanding the relevant threats resulting to an exposure of O-RAN assets by exploiting the vulnerabilities.

The objective is to give a comprehensive and high-level view on how security is organized in O-RAN system. In this document, we assume that 3GPP security requirements are met. Unless explicitly stated, features relate to O-RAN specifications.

This analysis is consolidated from various relevant sources, including main 5G standardization documents and telecommunication best practices (e.g., 3GPP, ETSI, NIST, ENISA).

The first main part outlines the main stockholder roles involved in managing and using O-RAN system. Further, it addresses the prerequisites and assumptions needed to securely implement and run O-RAN systems. It also identifies the list of critical assets to be protected in integrity, availability, confidentiality, replay and authenticity.

The second main part addresses the threat model. It identifies the threat agents, determines the threat surface, identifies vulnerabilities, and lists the threats for each O-RAN component or interface. For each threat, the description, threatened asset(s), vulnerabilities, threat agents and affected components are given.

The third main part describes the security principles to be achieved to counter the identified threats. In addition, it illustrates the coverage between threats and security principles.

The fourth main part is the risk assessment of the identified threats in terms of severity and likelihood.

NOTE 1:  The present document document focuses only on the components, interfaces and protocols specified by O-RAN alliance. Components, interfaces and protocols specified by 3GPP are only referenced where needed but are not within the scope of this specific O-RAN security analysis.

NOTE 2: The present document is a working document with the need to update the content on a regular basis following the risk evaluation.

NOTE 3: In this document, the term NF (Network Function) is used to designate either VNF (Virtual Network Function), CNF (Cloud-native Network Function) or PNF (Physical Network Function).

NOTE 4: Terms “Containers” and “Virtual Machines” are used interchangeably in this document as the implementation of O-RAN SW components could either be container-based, VM-based or hybrid (Containers and VMs together).

Methodology

The methodology adopted in this document is based on the standard ISO 27005 [7] which provide a detailed and flexible structure to release a risk assessment.

Refer to NIST SP 800-154 [13] for the definition of Attack, Attack Surface, Attack Vector, Controls, Risk, Risk Mitigation, Threat, and Vulnerability.

The methodology followed in this document comprises three stages:

Identification

Identify stakeholders: First, we need to identify the stakeholders involved in the implementation, management, operation and maintenance of the O-RAN system. Roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder are given.

Define assumptions: The list of minimum prerequisites and assumptions need to be defined for the operational environment (not under the control of the O-RAN system) required to successfully operate the O-RAN system.

Identify assets: First, we need to locate relevant assets the O-RAN system hold and give details about the type (Data, component, etc.), the security properties (CIA) at rest and in transit and location.

Identify threats: We need to identify the relevant threats associated with the new O-RAN components, interfaces and technologies. In addition, the threat surface and agents are given.

Identify vulnerabilities: O-RAN system may have weaknesses in its new O-RAN components, interfaces and technologies which need to be identified.

Define security principles: We need to define security principles to be achieved in order to reduce risk exposure.

Elaborate and refine security principles: Each security principle needs to be detailed and refined into requirements, recommendations and countermeasures.

Identify existing/ongoing countermeasures: We need to identify all of O-RAN existing/ongoing controls and to take into account the protection provided by these controls before applying any new ones.

Risk assessment

The value for Risk is defined by the following equation:

Risk = (the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability) x (total impact of the vulnerability being exploited)

Risk treatment

Now that we know the level of risk that each threat poses, we need to decide how we’ll treat them. There are four options:

Modify the risk by implementing a control to reduce the likelihood of it occurring.

Avoid the risk by ceasing any activity that creates it. This response is appropriate if the risk is too big to manage with a security control.

Share the risk with a third party. There are two ways: by outsourcing the security efforts to another organization or by purchasing cyber insurance to ensure the funds to respond appropriately in the event of a disaster.

Retain the risk. This means that the organization accepts the risk and believes that the cost of treating it is greater than the damage that it would cause.

Perimeter

This clause comprises the architecture in the scope of the security analysis. The architecture includes the list of O-RAN components, interfaces and protocols manipulating critical assets and implementing security functions.

Scope regarding architecture

As specified in [6], the logical architecture of O-RAN includes the following components, interfaces and protocols:

O-RAN components:

Network functions and applications

Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)

Non-RT RIC and rApps

Near-RT RIC and xApps

O-CU-CP/UP

O-DU

O-RU

O-eNB

Cloud computing platform

O-Cloud comprising a collection of physical infrastructure nodes that meet O-RAN requirements to host the relevant O-RAN functions (such as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU), the supporting software components (such as Operating System, Virtual Machine Monitor, Container Runtime, etc.) and the appropriate management and orchestration functions.

O-RAN specific interfaces:

A1 Interface between   Non-RT   RIC   and   Near-RT   RIC   to   enable   policy-driven   guidance   of   Near-RT RIC applications/functions, and support AI/ML workflow.

O1 Interface connecting the SMO to the Near-RT RIC, one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs.

O2 Interface between the SMO and the O-Cloud.

E2 Interface connecting the Near-RT RIC and one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, one or more O-DUs, and one or more O-eNBs.

Open Fronthaul M-Plane Interface between O-RU and O-DU as well as between O-RU and SMO.

Y1 Interface over which RAN analytics services exposed by the Near-RT RIC to be consumed by Y1 consumers.

Relevant Protocols used by O-RAN system for enforcing security:

Threat model

Threat surface

The O-RAN architecture [6] introduces new functions and interfaces. The introduction of additional interfaces and nodes, and the decoupling of hardware and software, expands the threat and attack surface of the network. For the purposes of this document, threat surfaces are divided into six (6) main groups:

Additional functions: SMO, Non-Real-Time RIC, Near-Real-Time RIC

Additional open interfaces: A1, E2, O1, O2, Open Fronthaul

Modified architecture: Lower Layer Split (LLS) 7-2x

Decoupling increases threat to Trust Chain

Containerization and Virtualization: Disaggregation of software and hardware

Exposure to public exploits may be increased due to use of Open Source Code

The following entry points are considered:

API between planes which facilitate the propagation of threats

Threats coming from inside the O-RAN system

Threats coming from outside the O-RAN system

Threat agent

For the purposes of this document, threat agents are categorized as follows:

Cyber-criminals: Represents individuals who commits cybercrimes, where he/she makes use of the computer either as a tool or as a target or as both.

Insiders: Represents malicious attacks perpetrated on a network or computer system by a person with authorized system access.

Hacktivists: Represents actors that perform cyber-attacks to achieve political or social gains.

Cyber-terrorists: Represents actors that their sole aim of violence against clandestine agents and subnational groups through the compromise of O-RAN infrastructures.

Script kiddies: Represents actors that do not poses deep technical expertise or resources to perform sophisticated attacks.

Nation-State: actors aggressively target and gain persistent access to public and private sector networks to compromise, steal, change, or destroy information.

Potential vulnerabilities

This document addresses the following potential security vulnerabilities that are exploitable through attacks against Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:

O-RAN specific vulnerabilities

Unauthorized access to O-DU, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and RU to degrade RAN performance or execute broader network attack (Availability)

Unprotected synchronization and control plane traffic on Open Fronthaul Interface (Integrity and Availability)

Disable over-the-air ciphers for eavesdropping (Confidentiality)

Near-RT RIC conflicts with O-gNB (Availability)

x/rApps conflicts (Availability)

x/rApps access to network and subscriber data (Confidentiality)

Unprotected management interface (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

CP UL or DL messages can be injected for attack on UP (Availability)

General vulnerabilities

Decoupling of functions without hardware root of trust and software trust chain (Integrity)

Exposure to public exploits from use of Open Source code (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Misconfiguration, poor isolation or insufficient access management in the O-Cloud platform (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Threats

For the purposes of this document, threats are grouped in eight categories:

Threats against O-RAN system

Threats against O-CLOUD

Threats to open source code

Physical threats

Threats against 5G radio networks

Threats against ML system

Protocol stack threats

SMO threats

The threat analysis is carried out using a well-defined structure to present each threat cases and simplify the risk analysis associated with each threat. In the following subsections, only a unique ID, title and description of each threat are given:

Threats against O-RAN system

Common among O-RAN components

The O-RAN system architecture introduces the following common threats among its components:

Threat ID

T-O-RAN-01

Threat title

An attacker exploits insecure designs or lack of adoption in O-RAN components

Threat description

Unauthenticated/unauthorized access to O-RAN components could possibly be achieved via the different O-RAN interfaces, depending upon the design of the hardware-software O-RAN system and how different functions are segregated within the O-RAN system.

O-RAN components might be vulnerable if:

Outdated component from the lack of update or patch management,

Poorly design architecture,

Missing appropriate security hardening,

Unnecessary or insecure function/protocol/component.

An attacker could, in such case, either inject malwares and/or manipulate existing software, harm the O-RAN components, create a performance issue by manipulation of parameters, or reconfigure the O-RAN components and disable the security features with the purpose of eavesdropping or wiretapping on various CUS & M planes, reaching northbound systems, attack broader network to cause denial-of-service, steal unprotected private keys, certificates, hash values, or other type of breaches.

In addition, O-RAN components could be software providing network functions, so they are likely to be vulnerable to software flaws: it could be possible to bypass firewall restrictions or to take advantage of a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary commands, etc.

Threat ID

T-O-RAN-02

Threat title

An attacker exploits misconfigured or poorly configured O-RAN components

Threat description

Unauthenticated/unauthorized access to O-RAN components could possibly be achieved via the different O-RAN interfaces, depending upon the configuration of the hardware-software O-RAN system.

O-RAN components might be vulnerable if:

Errors from the lack of configuration change management,

Misconfigured or poorly configured O-RAN components,

Improperly configured permissions,

Unnecessary features are enabled (e.g. unnecessary ports, services, accounts, or privileges),

Default accounts and their passwords still enabled and unchanged,

Security features are disabled or not configured securely.

An attacker could, in such case, either inject malwares and/or manipulate existing software, harm the O-RAN components, create a performance issue by manipulation of parameters, or reconfigure the O-RAN components and disable the security features with the purpose of eavesdropping or wiretapping on various CUS & M planes, reaching northbound systems, attack broader network to cause denial-of-service, steal unprotected private keys, certificates, hash values, or other type of breaches.

Threat ID

T-O-RAN-03

Threat title

Attacks from the internet exploit weak authentication and access control to penetrate O-RAN network boundary

Threat description

Web servers serving O-RAN functional and management services should provide adequate protection.

An attacker that have access to the uncontrolled O-RAN network could:

Bypass the information flow control policy implemented by the firewall,

And/or attack O-RAN components in the trusted networks by taking advantage of particularities and errors in the design and implementation of the network protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, application protocols),

Use of incorrect or exceeded TCP sequence numbers,

Perform brute force attacks on FTP passwords,

Use of improper HTTP user sessions,

Etc.

The effects of such attacks may include:

An intrusion, meaning unauthorized access to O-RAN components,

Blocking, flooding or restarting an O-RAN component causing a denial of service,

Flooding of network equipment, causing a denial of service,

Etc.

Threat ID

T-O-RAN-04

Threat title

An attacker attempts to jam the airlink signal through IoT devices

Threat description

DDoS attacks on O-RAN systems: The 5G evolution means billions of things, collectively referred to as IoT, will be using the 5G O-RAN. Thus, IoT could increase the risk of O-RAN resource overload by way of DDoS attacks. Attackers create a botnet army by infecting many (millions/billions) IoT devices with a “remote-reboot” malware. Attackers instruct the malware to reboot all devices in a specific or targeted 5G coverage area at the same time.

Threat ID

T-O-RAN-05

Threat title

An attacker penetrates and compromises the O-RAN system through the open O-RAN’s Fronthaul, O1, O2, A1, and E2

Threat description

O-RAN’s Fronthaul, O1, O2, A1, and E2 management interfaces are the new open interfaces that allow software programmability of RAN. These interfaces may not be secured to industry best practices.

O-RAN components might be vulnerable if:

Improper or missing authentication and authorization processes,

Improper or missing ciphering and integrity checks of sensitive data exchanged over O-RAN interfaces,

Improper or missing replay protection of sensitive data exchanged over O-RAN interfaces,

Improper prevention of key reuse,

Improper implementation,

Improperly validate inputs, respond to error conditions in both the submitted data as well as out of sequence protocol steps.

An attacker could, in such case, cause denial-of-service, data tampering or information disclosure, etc.

NOTE: O-RAN interfaces allow use of TLS or SSH. Industry best practices mandate the use of TLS (v1.2 or higher) or SSH certificate-based authentication. An implementation that implements TLS version lower than 1.2 or a SSH password authentication, may become the key source of vulnerability that a malicious code will exploit to compromise the O-RAN system.

Threat ID

T-O-RAN-06

Threat title

An attacker exploits insufficient/improper mechanisms for authentication and authorization to compromise O-RAN components

Threat description

O-RAN management and orchestration should not be used without appropriate authentication and authorization and authorization checks.

O-RAN components might be vulnerable if:

Unauthenticated access to O-RAN functions,

Improper authentication mechanisms,

Use of Predefined/ default accounts,

Weak or missing password policy,

Lack of mutual authentication to O-RAN components and interfaces,

Failure to block consecutive failed login attempts,

Improper authorization and access control policy.

An attacker could, in such case, either inject malwares and/or manipulate existing software, harm the O-RAN components, create a performance issue by manipulation of parameters, or reconfigure the O-RAN components and disable the security features with the purpose of eavesdropping or wiretapping on various CUS & M planes, reaching northbound systems, attack broader network to cause denial-of-service, steal unprotected private keys, certificates, hash values, or other type of breaches.

Threat ID

T-FRHAUL-01

Threat title

An attacker penetrates O-DU and beyond through O-RU or the Fronthaul interface [12]

Threat description

When having two different vendors, the O-RU and the O-DU needs to be managed as different entities and may have heterogeneous security levels. Instead, the O-DU will have to bridge the management traffic between the management system and the O-RU. Hence the possibilities to reach the northbound systems beyond the O-DU through the Open Fronthaul interface become a possible attack vector in this split architecture.

Threat ID

T-FRHAUL-02

Threat title

Unauthorized access to Open Front Haul Ethernet L1 physical layer interface(s)

Threat description

The Open Front Haul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. Each end of the Open Front Haul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, e.g., O-DU, O-RU, etc.

Unauthorized access to the Open Front Haul Ethernet L1 physical layer interface (cables and connections) provides a means to launch attacks on the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the Open Front Haul system.

Potential loss of availability on the Open Front Haul interface can occur from one or more of the following threats:

An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface can flood the L1 interface with unintended network traffic causing disruption or degradation of authorized network elements on the Open Front Haul interface.

An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface can send L2 messages to authorized network devices causing disruption, denial, or degradation of the Open Front Haul interface.

An attacker (person) gains access to the Open Front Haul Ethernet L1 interface(s) and denies the Open Front Haul services by disabling a physical connection to a network element either by removing an Ethernet port connection or cutting the physical interface (coaxial cable, twisted pair, or optical fiber).

Potential loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity on the Open Front Haul interface can occur from one or more of the following threats:

An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface has access to U-Plane traffic on the Open Front Hall Interface.

An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface has access to S-Plane traffic on the Open Front Hall Interface.

An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface has access to C-Plane traffic on the Open Front Hall Interface.

An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface has access to M-Plane traffic on the Open Front Hall Interface.

Threat ID

T-MPLANE-01

Threat title

An attacker attempts to intercept the Fronthaul (MITM) over M Plane

Threat description

The High bit rate Fronthaul interface impose strict performance requirements ((bandwidth, latency, fronthaul transport link length, etc.) that limit the use of some security features, due to the increased processing delay. This opens the risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks over the fronthaul interface or O1 to intercept the M plane.

For the transported Management-Plane data over the fronthaul interface or O1, an Attacker could potentially do threats, such as passive wiretapping and denial of service, but would need to break M-Plane Security prior to gain OAM access.

Threat ID

T-SPLANE-01

Threat title

DoS attack against a Master clock

Threat description

A denial of service (DoS) attack towards a Master clock of the timing network used by the open Fronthaul to maintain the availability and accuracy of the Master clock. An attacker can attack a master clock by sending an excessive number of time protocol packets or impersonate a legitimate clock, a slave, or an intermediate clock, by sending malicious messages to the master, thus degrading the victim’s performance.

The attacker may be residing either within the attacked network (insider) or on an external network connected to the attacked network.

This attack results in a situation where the clock service is interrupted completely or the timing protocol is operational but slaves are being provided inaccurate timing information due the degraded performance of the Master clock.

This clock service disruption or degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.

A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.

Threat title

Impersonation of a Master clock (Spoofing) within a PTP network with a fake ANNOUNCE message

Threat description

An attacker within the PTP network can impersonate the master clock’s grandmasterIdentity value and propose himself as a grandmaster candidate by sending fake ANNOUNCE messages declaring him to be the best clock in the network. The attacker may be residing either within the attacked network (insider) or on an external network connected to the attacked network.

This attack results in a situation where the attacker clock becomes a GM, PTP is operational, all clocks are synchronized, but the malicious GM provides intentionally inaccurate timing information.

This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.

A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.

Threat ID

T-SPLANE-03

Threat title

A Rogue PTP Instance wanting to be a Grand Master

Threat description

An attacker can propose himself as a grandmaster candidate by sending manipulated/malicious ANNOUNCE messages declaring him to be the best clock in the network. The attacker causes other nodes in the network to believe it is a legitimate master. The attacker is internal to the attacked PTP network and could launch this attack by either modification of in-flight protocol packets or injecting fake ANNOUNCE messages to the PTP network. It is assumed that an MITM attacker has physical access to a segment of the network or has gained control of one of the nodes in the network. This attack results in a situation where the time protocol is operational but slaves are being provided intentionally inaccurate timing information.

This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.

A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.

Threat ID

T-SPLANE-04

Threat title

Selective interception and removal of PTP timing packets

Threat description

An attacker can position himself in such way that allows him to intercept and remove valid synchronization packets. This leads to clock synchronization errors of all clocks downstream or makes them go into free-running mode.

Attacks may be launched close to the GM by tapping the egress line of an active GM clock. This impacts a larger set of slaves who depend on this GM for timing synchronization.

Attacks may also target a one or more slaves. This is done by tapping the ingress line of a particular slave(s). The impact is confined to the targeted slaves.

Alternatively, a MiTM attacker can reside in an intermediate node such as TCs, routers and switches to launch this attack. The attacker has physical access to a node of the PTP n/w or has gained full control of one device in the network. This requires additional capability to tap the h/w where PTP timing is implemented.

Selective interception and removal can impact timing packets and cause clock degradation in attacked nodes. Removing all packets or random packets may push the clocks in attacked nodes into free running mode

This attack results in a situation where the time protocol is operational, but slaves are being provided intentionally inaccurate timing information.

This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.

A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.

Threat ID

T-SPLANE-05

Threat title

Packet delay manipulation attack

Threat description

IEEE 1588 requires symmetric delays between GM and slaves. In packet delay manipulation attacks, the attacker is positioned such a way that allows him to delay the transmission of legitimate time synchronization protocol packets to the indended destination.

An attacker launches this attack by either tapping the transmission network or by taking control of an intermediate nodes such as routers, switches and T-TCs.

This attack results in a situation where the time protocol is operational, but slaves are being provided intentionally inaccurate timing information.

This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.

A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.

Threat ID

T-UPLANE-01

Threat title

An attacker attempts to intercept the Fronthaul (MITM) over U Plane

Threat description

The High bit rate Fronthaul interface impose strict performance requirements ((bandwidth, latency, fronthaul transport link length, etc.) that limit the use of some security features, due to the increased processing delay. This opens the risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks over the fronthaul interface to intercept the U-Plane.

For the transported U-Plane data an attacker could potentially do threats, such as passive wiretapping and denial of service, but would need to break PDCP Security prior to any content access.

3GPP defines UP integrity protection algorithms in their specifications but many of the OEMs have not implemented them because of impact on the user experience (e.g. download and upload data throughputs). Enabling UP integrity protection requires considerable compute resources and adds overhead that directly impacts the maximum throughputs that can be measured on the user device. The integrity protection is enabled on the Control Plane messages but that still leaves the user’s data traffic vulnerable because the Control Plane and User Plane are segregated. For example, the lack of UP integrity could enable a rogue base station to manipulate the user data messages (i.e. DNS) and redirect a user to a malicious website.

Threats against O-RU

The O-RU introduces the following threats:

Threat ID

T-ORU-01

Threat title

An attacker stands up a false base station attack by attacking an O-RU

Threat description

A false base station attack occurs when an attacker masquerades as a legitimate mobile network to facilitate a Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attack between a subscriber’s user equipment (UE) and the mobile network.

There are three attack scenarios on an O-RU that enable an attacker to realize a false base station attack:

Hijack fronthaul to realize a false base station attack: Attacker disables an operational O-RU’s access to the open fronthaul, plugs a false base station system into the operational O-RU’s fronthaul interface, and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.

Recruit a standalone O-RU to realize a false base station attack: The stand-alone O-RU is an O-RU that is not operational but is available to an attacker to incorporate into a false base station system. The attacker plugs a false base station system into the standalone O-RU’s fronthaul interface and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.

Gain unauthorized physical access to O-RU to realize a false base station attack: An attacker gains access to external and internal components of an O-RU (other than the open fronthaul interface), connects the O-RU under attack to a false base station system, and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.

Successful attacks may cause:

For a subscriber’s UE in attack scenarios 1, 2, and 3: the false base stations, also known as SUPI/5G-GUTI catchers, retrieves a subscriber identity by forcing a UE to attach to the false base station systems. This opens the door to subscriber identity interception/disclosure and unauthorized subscriber tracking attacks. These attacks include stealing subscriber information, tampering with transmitted information, tracking subscribers, and compromising subscriber privacy.

For the operator network: in attack scenario 1, the attacker removes the operational O-RU from providing service to UEs in the coverage area served by the operational O-RU.

For operators and vendors in attack scenarios 1, 2, and 3, the attacker recruits legitimate operator/vendor equipment for the purpose of creating a false base station attack on subscribers, possibly harming the reputation of the operator and vendor whose O-RU was used in the attack.

NOTE: The false base station threat has existed since GSM networks and continued to evolve and persist with the evolution of mobile networks. 5G networks are expected to introduce several security enhancements over 4G and legacy networks. Despite these security enhancements, 5G networks could still be a target of false base station attacks [19].

Threats against Near-RT RIC

Near-Real-Time (RT) RIC introduces the following threats:

Figure 72 : UE Identification in Near-RT-RIC

Threat ID

T-NEAR-RT-01

Threat title

Malicious xApps can exploit UE identification, track UE location and change UE priority [12]

Threat description

xApps in the Near-RT-RIC have the capability to manipulate behavior of a certain cell, a group of UEs, and a specific UE. A malfunctioning or unavailable root of trust could potentially cause issues on the network and compromise RAN performance, privacy, etc. For example, the xApp could track a certain subscriber or impact service for a subscriber or a dedicated area. In addition, an xApp can receive order via A1 to control a certain UE and if a malfunctioning xApp receives an order to prioritize this UE, then the owner of the malfunctioning xApp knows a VIP that they want to track is in a certain area. With this command exposure, the attacker can obtain a rough location of a very important person and change the order from prioritize to deprioritize for a UE.

Further, E2 interface exposes UE identification that can be exploited by a malicious xApp. As the E2 interface (similar to A1 interface) can point out a certain UE in the network, this will create a correlation between the randomized (anonymized) UE identities between the RAN nodes. For example, a xApp can potentially be used as a “sniffer” for UE identification. The additional challenge for the Near-RT RIC / E2 compared to the Non-RT RIC / A1 is that more frequent signaling is expected over the E2 interface to enable near-real-time operation. Therefore, the UE identifier will be exchanged more frequently over the E2 than over the A1.

Threat ID

T-NEAR-RT-03

Threat title

Attackers exploit non authenticated, weakly or incorrectly authenticated Near-RT RIC APIs

Threat description

Not mutually authenticating xApps and Near-RT RIC platform APIs could potentially allow attackers to perform the following type of attacks [20]:

Operating malicious xApp claiming to be genuine in order to request certain services (theft of services) or information (data leakage)

Man in the middle attacks between a genuine xApp and a Near-RT RIC platform API

Querying network or UE information from a compromised xApp to Near-RT RIC platform (e.g. database via SDL API), thereby leaking potentially sensitive data about network and/or UE (potential privacy issues)

Subscribing a malicious xApp to services provided by the Near-RT RIC platform, such as API-related events notifications, discovery of APIs, E2SM, etc.

The use of weak credentials in the process of API authentication can compromise the overall system. The user/password combination isn’t considered safe, not only for password related attacks (e.g., brute-force), but also it would represent a high risk to allow xApps, especially 3rd party xApps, to store the user/password combo. This approach would extend the attack surface into xApps side.

As a reference, OWASP API Security Top 10 report [21] indicates that authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently. Compromising system's ability to identify the client/user, compromises API security overall.

Threat ID

T-NEAR-RT-04

Threat title

Attackers exploit non authorized Near-RT RIC APIs to access to resources and services which they are not entitled to use.

Threat description

If the API consumers are not authorized by the API producers, attackers (e.g, malicious xApps) would potentially be able to perform the following types of attacks:

Abuse and/or theft of services or information (data leakage), requesting and successfully obtaining them from the platform, e.g, in order to extract potentially sensitive information from the network and/or UEs

Negatively impacting the network performance due to malicious policies over E2 Nodes

Flooding the platform with resource demanding operations that may lead to a Denial of Service attack

As a reference, OWASP API Security Top 10 report [21] indicates that ‘Broken Object Level Authorization’ has been the most common and impactful attack on APIs. Even if the application implements a proper infrastructure for authorization checks, developers might forget to use these checks before accessing a sensitive object. Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation.

In the actual context of Near-RT RIC [8], the platform as API producer is responsible to specify those rights/privileges for the platform services as resources to the xApps as consumers. In general, an xApp should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more.

NOTE: The investigation of services for which the API producer is the xApp is for further study

Threat ID

T-NEAR-RT-05

Threat title

Attackers exploit non uniquely identified xApps using a trusted xAppID to access to resources and services which they are not entitled to use.

Threat description

Not uniquely identifying xApps using a trusted xAppID potentially entails certain threats and potential attacks:

A non-unique xAppID might cause misidentification of an xApp, possibly allowing a potentially malicious xApp to request certain services (theft of services), information (data leakage), or alter existing information

A malicious xApp might use the xAppID assigned to a legitimate xApp to request services or information from Near-RT RIC platform

A non-unique xApp ID could make it impossible to accurately assign actions to the correct xApp

A non-unique xApp ID could make it difficult to recognize that a malicious xApp is in the environment

Threat title

An attacker exploits xApps vulnerabilities and misconfiguration

Threat description

Vulnerabilities can potentially exist in any xApp if it stems from an untrusted or unmaintained source. If attackers can find exploitable xApp, they can disrupt the offered network service and potentially take over another xApp or the whole near-RT RIC.

The actual consequences may vary. For example, an attacker may gain the ability to alter data transmitted over A1 or E2 interfaces, extract sensitive information, etc.

Malicious xApps impact near-RT RIC functions in the purpose of performance degradation, DoS, etc.

xAPPs have the capability to manipulate behavior of a certain cell, a group of UEs, and a specific UE. A malfunctioning xApp could potentially track a certain subscriber or impact service for a subscriber or a dedicated area [12].

Threat ID

Threat title

Conflicting xApps unintentionally or maliciously impact O-RAN system functions to degrade performance or trigger a DoS [12]

Threat description

Conflicting xApps unintentionally or maliciously impact O-RAN system functions such as mobility management, admission controls, bandwidth management and load balancing in the purpose of performance degradation.

There is no clear functional split between the Near-RT RIC and the O-gNB. The functional split depends on the available xApps and the capabilities exposed by the O-gNB. This creates possible conflicts between the decisions taken by the Near-RT RIC and the O-gNB that could lead to instability in the network, which introduces vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors. For example, a threat actor can utilize a malicious xApp that intentionally triggers RRM decisions conflicting with the O-gNB internal decisions to create denial of service.

Threat ID

T-xApp-03

Threat title

An attacker compromises xApp isolation

Threat description

An attacker can exploit weaknesses and vulnerabilities to compromise xApp isolation and to break out of xApp confinement. For example, attacker can use the underlying system vulnerabilities to easily breach isolation and confinement.

Adversary can use side effects resulting from a shared resource usage to deduce information from co-hosted xApps.

Gaining unauthorized access to the underlying system provides new opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in other xApps or O-RAN components to intercept and spoof network traffic, to degrade services (DoS), etc.

Threat ID

T-xApp-04

Threat title

False or malicious A1 policies from the Non-RT RIC inform behavior of xApps to trigger a DoS, affect performance, or locate a subscriber.

Threat description

Unauthorized access to the Non-RT RIC enables the creation of ‘false policies’ that can be issued to the Near-RT RIC for enforcement. Existing Near-RT RIC policies could also be modified to achieve a false policy. False policies passed to the Near-RT RIC would be persistent until they were modified or deleted by the Non-RT RIC or the Near-RT RIC power cycles.

False policies can be created to have numerous impacts to the normal performance of the RAN. A single false A1 policy can target a specific UE, groups of UEs, or an entire cell. A false policy could influence the Near-RT RIC to configure the O-DU and O-RU functions to support Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by using feedback data to degrade RAN performance.

False policies could also be used for the purpose of locating a subscriber or group of subscribers. In this case, the false policy would cause the Near-RT RIC to isolate a subscriber in the O-CU. The Near-RT RIC could also use MIMO beamforming in the O-DU and O-RU to isolate a user onto a single beam. The data feedback from the RAN can include UE location or trajectory information from GPS data. The subscriber location would be attained from access to the Non-RT RIC in the SMO function.

The Near-RT RIC is capable of steering traffic to achieve optimal QoS or QoE performance. A false policy could notionally cause the Near-RT RIC to steer user data to isolate the data in order to facilitate a cyber-attack.

Threats against rApps

Threats against rApps include:

Threat ID

T-rAPP-01

Threat title

Conflicting rApps unintentionally or maliciously impact O-RAN system functions to degrade performance or trigger a DoS

Threat description

rApps in the Non-RT RIC can be provided by different vendors. For example, one vendor can provide the rApp for Carrier license scheduling and another vendor provide the rApp for energy saving, etc.

This creates the risk that different rApps will take conflicting decisions at the same instance in time for the same user. Such conflicts between rApps include:

Direct conflicts: different rApps request change for the same parameter.

Indirect conflicts: different rApps request change to different parameters that will create opposite effects.

Implicit conflicts: different rApps request change to different parameters that are not creating any obvious opposite effect but result in an overall network performance degradation, instabilities, etc.

These conflicts are difficult to mitigate since dependencies are impossible to observe.

Threats against O-CLOUD

Virtualization and containerization technologies in O-RAN introduce the following relevant threats:

Generic Threats

Threat ID

T-GEN-01

Threat title

Software flaw attack

Threat description

Code of host OS, Hypervisor/Container Engine and VNF/CNF can include flaws that an attacker can exploit if they are present.

As O-RAN software components relies on opensource software, opensource libraries, 3rd party components. Vulnerability in any of these software components likely to allow attacker to exploit O-CLOUD environment. This could lead attacker to carry out to malicious activities, such as:

Compromise of the underlying VM/Container

Exploit host access via Escape to Host

Take advantage of weak identity and access management policies to attempt to elevate privileges

Execute adversary-controlled code

Enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host

Threat ID

T-GEN-02

Threat title

	Malicious access to exposed services using valid accounts

Threat description

Access to valid accounts to use the O-Cloud services is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the network.

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on O-Cloud.

Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific O-Cloud services or access to restricted areas of the O-Cloud network.

Access may be also gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.

Threat ID

T-GEN-03

Threat title

Untrust binding between the different O-Cloud layers

Threat description

One major challenge in virtualized architectures and especially in O-Cloud is to prove that a particular VM/Container runs on top of a specific Hypervisor/Container Engine. More specifically, it is necessary to assure that a trusted VM/Container is executed on a particular trusted Hypervisor/Container Engine, whereas the Hypervisor/Container Engine's trust state relies on an attestation that considers the entire corresponding hard and software stack. More precisely, this includes all hardware chips, firmware, OS and Hypervisor/Container Engine components that are relevant for the Hypervisor/Container Engine's trust state determination.

If it is not possible to establish a correlation between VM/Container and Hypervisor/Container Engine, an attacker is able to make use of a trusted VM/Container that runs on top of an untrusted Hypervisor/Container Engine and it would be impossible to detect any interference made by the malicious Hypervisor/Container Engine, e.g. intercepting communication, replacing strong or using weak cryptographic keys, etc. Similarly, trustworthiness in the service-layer might only be established if there is a mechanism to determine that only trusted VNFs/CNFs, w.r.t trusted VM/Container's, are running on specific trusted Hypervisors/Container Engines that are part of the service-provisioning-chain.

Threat ID

T-GEN-04

Threat title

Lack of Authentication & Authorization in interfaces between O-Cloud components

Threat description

O-Cloud deploys CNF applications as containers in a cluster of physical nodes which may be spanned across geographical locations. Owing to the Service Based Architecture of CNFs, this introduces several service endpoints communicating across each other over the network (container to container, container to cloud infrastructure component) and it is fairly difficult to distinguish between a service terminating an external interface and a service exposing only an internal interface.

Multi-tenant deployments and deployments in public cloud also require the CNF applications to run alongside unknown entities. In such deployment scenarios, CNF service endpoints with no authentication/weak authentication expose risk of attack that can impact the availability of service and the CNF.

Lack of proper authentication in interfaces exposed by CNF services, introduces threats of lateral movement where a compromised container/rogue container

can compromise the availability of internal service by bringing down the internal service and perform lateral movement of attack by exploiting the availability of other such services

can compromise the confidentiality of the internal service by extracting critical application data

Threat ID

T-GEN-05

Threat title

	Unsecured credentials and keys

Threat description

Adversaries may search compromised O-RAN NFs, VL, orchestration layer or hardware to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on the O-cloud platform, including plaintext files (e.g. Bash History), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. Credentials in Registry), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. Private Keys) [22].

Bash History: Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.

Credentials in registry: Adversaries may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.

Private Keys: Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures; Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.

Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.

Threats concerning VMs/Containers

Threat ID

T-VM-C-01

Threat title

Abuse of a privileged VM/Container

Threat description

It’s possible to run VMs/Containers with unintended configurations. Such misconfigurations can help the adversaries to compromise even strongest of VM/Container isolation measures.

Such misconfigurations scenarios include:

A VMs/Containers can be configured to have more privileges than what is actually required (e.g. settings that give it unnecessary, and perhaps unplanned, privileges). For example, an attacker with access to such a container, can use it to gain higher privileges on host, perform un-authorized operations and get to anything that the host, or any of the containers running on that host, can reach.

A VMs/Containers have unintended read/write access to a directory on host filesystem. This could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized modifications to the contents, create symbolic links to any directories or files not directly exposed by the hostPath, install SSH keys, read secrets mounted to the host, and take other malicious actions.

Threat ID

T-VM-C-02

Threat title

VM/Container escape attack

Threat description

VNF/CNF deployed on the same physical machine as tenants share the same host kernel and host OS resources. Lack of strong isolation between the VMs/Containers and the host allows for a potential risk of a rogue VM/Container escaping the VM/Container confinement and impacting other co-hosted VMs/Containers. In others, an attacker may deploy a new malicious VM/Container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within O-Cloud infrastructure.

Attacker deploys malicious VM/Container to escapes the host (Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS) and reaches the server’s hardware, then the malicious VM/Container can gain root access to the whole server where it resides. This gives the malicious VM/Container full control on all the VMs/Containers hosted on the same hacked server. This could allow an attacker to undermine the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of VNFs/CNFs resources.

Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow. Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.

	When a malicious VM/Container escapes isolation, it can gain full control over the underlying host and cause any of the below serious threats:

Attacker would gain the ability to mount attacks on the host or compromise the host functionalities

Compromise the confidentiality & integrity of co-hosted VMs/Containers and tenants

Launch DDOS attacks on co-hosted VMs/Containers and host services thereby degrading their performance

Introduce new vulnerabilities in host to be used for future attacks

Lack of network segmentation could potentially expose other VMs/Containers in the environment to attack. An example of this could be reconnaissance, exploitation and subsequent lateral movement to another host within the cluster.

T-VM-C-03

Threat title

	VM/Container data theft

Threat description

The VNF/CNF remotely stores sensitive data (e.g. passwords, private keys, subscription data, logs) on the logical volume that the IMS/DMS allocates to the VNF/CNF. An attacker can retrieve/manipulate these data if they have been stored in an insecure way (e.g. clear text, unsalted hashes) or a malware is installed on the logical volume that the VIM allocates to the VNF/CNF.

Container example: Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available locally within O-Cloud. Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster. These resources can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs. In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment’s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing. The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary’s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution.

Threat ID

T-VM-C-04

Threat title

VM/Container migration attacks

Threat description

The attacks that exploit VM/Container migration can be divided into two subcategories based on the target plane:

Control Plane Attacks: These attacks target the module that is responsible for handling the migration process on a server which is called the migration module that is found in the host. By exploiting a bug in the migration module software, the attacker can hack the server and take full control over the migration module. This gives the attacker the ability to launch malicious activities including the following:

Migration Flooding: The attacker moves all the VMs/Containers that are hosted on the hacked server to a victim server that does not have enough resource capacity to host all the moved VMs/Containers. This causes a denial of service for the VNFs/CNFs running in the VMs/Containers of the victim server as there will not be enough resources to satisfy the demands of all the hosted VMs/Containers leading into VM/Container performance degradation and VM/Container crashes.

False Resource Advertising: The hacked server claims that it has a large resource slack (a large amount of free resources). This attracts other servers to off-load some of their VMs/Containers to the hacked server so that the O-Cloud workload gets distributed over the O-Cloud servers. After moving VMs/Containers from other servers to the hacked server, the attacker can exploit other vulnerabilities to break into the offloaded VMs/Containers as now these VMs/Containers are placed on a server that is under the control of the attacker.

Data Plane Attacks: These constitute the second type of VM/Container migration attacks and those attacks target the network links over which the VM/Container is moved from a server to another. Such data plane attacks include the MitM where an attacker sniffs the packets that are exchanged between the source and destination servers and reads the migrated memory pages. The attacker can monitor and/or modify the received packets while continuing to forward them to victim VM/Container resides so that the victim does not detect that any malicious activity is going on.

	Changing virtualization resource without authorization

Threat description

IMS/DMS which manage the Virtualization layer is responsible for assigning virtualized resource as requested.

There are several ways to cause a DoS attack for the VNFs/CNFs:

If IMS/DMS are compromised or the O2 interface is not securely protected, an attacker who compromised the IMS/DMS or breached the O2 interface can change the virtualized resource used by a VNF/CNF by manipulating the allocation of virtualized resource. For example, when an instantiated VNF/CNF is running, adversaries having access to a compromised IMS/DMS or adversaries breaching the insecure O2 interface can misguide the Virtualization layer to reduce the resource of or delete a VM/Container on which a VNF/CNF is running. This can result in the reliability, availability or even illegal termination of a VNF/CNF and hence the denial of service.

Hardware resource configuration and state information (e.g. events) exchange is performed through O2 interface. If the IMS is compromised or the O2 interface is not securely protected, an attacker who compromised the IMS or breached the O2 interface can tamper the hardware configuration and state information so that the virtualized resource supported by the hardware layer becomes unreliable. For example, adversaries having access to a compromised IMS or adversaries breaching the insecure O2 interface can misguide the O-Cloud platform to detach a hardware accelerator from a VNF/CNF.

Adversaries having access to a compromised virtualization layer can change the virtualization resource used by the instantiated VNF/CNF without authorization,

A malicious VM/Container deployed for one instance of a VNF/CNF on a host can illegally occupy the resources of the instantiated VNF/CNF deployed on the same host, resulting in resource limitation of the instantiated VNF/CNF

In this type of attacks, the extra allocation of resources for the malicious VM/Container comes at the expense of the other VMs/Containers that share the same server as the malicious VM/Container, where these victim VMs/Containers get allocated less share of resources than what they should actually obtain, which in turn degrades their performance.

Failed or incomplete VNF/CNF termination or releasing of resources

Threat description

A malicious VNF/CNF is instantiated in the O-Cloud infrastructure to access to data not erased from a terminated VNF/CNF or any VNF/CNF that has released resources. Data could include application data, cryptographic keys...

Abuse of resources allocation in the O-Cloud infrastructure to allocate to a malicious VNF/CNF the virtual resources released from a terminated VNF/CNF or from a VNF/CNF that has released resources after a move or a scaling process.

Threat title

VM/Container images tampering

Threat description

An attacker can inject malicious code or tamper the information inside the unprotected image during on boarding. Then after the instantiation of the VNF/CNF, the tampered code can cause DoS, information stealing, frauds and so on. There are several attacks categories belonging to this threat. Such attacks include:

Build machine attacks: If an attacker can modify or influence the way a VM/Container image is built, they could insert malicious code that will subsequently get run in the production environment.

Supply chain attacks: Once the VM/Container image is built, it gets stored in a registry, and it gets retrieved or “pulled” from the registry at the point where it’s going to be run. An attacker who can replace an image or modify an image between build and deployment could run arbitrary code on your deployment.

Threat ID

T-IMG-02

Threat title

Insecure channels with images repository

Threat description

Images often contain sensitive components like an organization’s proprietary software, and embedded secrets and administrator credentials. If connections to registries are performed over insecure channels, man-in-the-middle attacks could intercept network traffic and therefore the contents integrity and confidentiality of images may be compromised. There is also an increased risk of man-in-the-middle attacks that could intercept network traffic intended for registries and steal developer or administrator credentials within that traffic. Thus, could be used to provide fraudulent or outdated images to orchestrators, etc.

Threat ID

T-IMG-03

Threat title

Secrets disclosure in VM/Container images

Threat description

There are scenarios which benefit from including configuration and secrets, such as passwords or credentials in VNFs/CNFs images. For e.g. VMs/Containers require to be able to connect to other VMs/Containers within the deployment as well as with external entities. All these connections need to be authenticated and secured. One way of achieving this is to provide the requisite secrets or keys to the VMs/Containers which allow them to authenticate, be authenticated, secure the communication channel and signature.  A common but in-secure means of providing secrets to the VMs/Containers is by packaging the secrets or the keys with the image itself. There is the risk that the same can be extracted, read or manipulated before the VM/Container is deployed and the secret used.

With a long supply chain, VM/Container images are vulnerable to outside scrutiny. With VM/Container images containing secrets or keys, this becomes a serious threat vector. Adversaries can extract them by obtaining a copy of the image and they can be potentially shared with third parties for illicit gain.

Secrets embedded within a VM/Container image can be stolen.

Secrets embedded within a VM/Container image can be modified

Compromised private keys and algorithms used for image signing due to poor key protection/management/design could undermine the security of image signing process.

Threat ID

T-IMG-04

Threat title

Build image on VL

Threat description

Adversaries may build a VM/Container image directly on the VL to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a registry.

Container example: A remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.

An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and they then may deploy container using that custom image. If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since it’s a vanilla image. If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment.

Threats concerning the virtualization layer (Host OS-Hypervisor/Container engine)

Threat ID

T-VL-01

Threat title

VM/Container hyperjacking attack

Threat description

VMs/Containers run on host machines, and it is needed to ensure that those hosts (Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS- are not running vulnerable code (for example, old versions of components with known vulnerabilities).

Hyperjacking is an attack in which adversaries gain control over the host of a server or install a malicious Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS and exploit that to run malicious applications on the VM/Container that run on top of the host. This would enable the attacker to control all the VMs/Containers running on the host.

Hyperjacking involves installing a malicious, fake the Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS that can manage the entire server system. If the attacker gains access to the Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS, everything that is connected to that server can be manipulated. The Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS represents a single point of failure when it comes to the security and protection of sensitive information.

For a hyperjacking attack to succeed, an attacker would have to take control of the Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS by the following methods:

Injecting a rogue Hypervisor/Container Engine or Host OS beneath the original hypervisor or on top of an existing Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS

Directly obtaining control of the original Hypervisor/Container Engine or Host OS

Running a rogue hypervisor on top of an existing hypervisor

	Boot tampering

Threat description

The bootloader of the virtualization layer (Host OS, Hypervisor, Container Engine) for VNF/CNF may be maliciously tampered by an attacker, e.g. the attacker compromises hypervisor or host OS to tamper the bootloader of guest OS (in case of VM) or Container.

In a O-Cloud environment any failure during the boot sequence can result in a number of situations that need to be handled by the NFO/FOCOM:

• failure of the physical machine to start at all

• physical machine entering a safe-mode

• physical machine continuing boot regardless of the integrity measurements

Threat ID

T-VL-03

Threat title

	Attack internal network services

Threat description

In addition to attacking the network between containers, adversaries can also attack supporting services such as DNS service, which is only reachable from within the cluster network. The highly distributed nature of containers requires shared services for example for coordination and service discovery. An attacker can target these services to degrade services. For example, a denial-of-service against the service discovery infrastructure could prevent O-Cloud to react to changing resource requirements properly. Thus, O-Cloud may no longer be able to scale appropriately to sudden demand spikes [16].

Threats concerning O-Cloud interfaces

O2 interface

Two main interfaces are defined in O-RAN WG6 specification and identified as critical assets of O-Cloud, i.e. interfaces O2 between O-Cloud and SMO. The threats on these interfaces are as follows.

Threat ID

T-O2-01

Threat title

	MitM attacks on O2 interface between O-Cloud and SMO

Threat description

If the interface O2 interface is not protected, an attacker can attack all the requests/responses sent between the O-Cloud and the SMO (FOCOM and NFO).

For example, the attacker can tamper/alter/disclose requests and services (See ‘Critical services’ in 2.3) sent over O2 between O-Cloud and SMO, hence the virtualized resource or relevant status information is not as requested. This affects the normal operation of the O-Cloud, and even causes DoS attacks, information leakage.

An attacker can tamper the specific assignment of virtualized resources to cause resource assignment errors or an attacker can intercept virtualized resources state information leading to information disclosure.

An attacker can compromise IMS to tamper with the hardware state information (e.g. deleting hardware alarm information) to affect the hardware's operation or to result in information disclosure (e.g. an attacker can get the hardware configuration from the compromised IMS. Then, the attacker can attack the hardware according to the configuration such as CPU type, memory size etc.). An attacker can also tamper or intercept the hardware resource configuration and state information if the configuration and state information are transmitted using an insecure protocol on the O2 interface.

	MitM attacks on O-Cloud interface between VNFs/CNFs and the virtualization layer

Threat description

An attacker can attack an instantiated VNF/CNF through a compromised virtualization layer. For example, cryptographic keys or other security critical data of an instantiated VNF/CNF could be stolen by an attacker with access to the virtualization layer, or the virtualized resource provided by the Virtualization layer to the instantiated VNF/CNF can be manipulated or the bootloader of Guest OS (in case of VM) or Container of an instantiated VNF/CNF can be tampered by an attacker via a compromised virtualization layer.

Threats concerning hardware resources

Threat ID

T-HW-01

Threat title

	Cross VM/Container side channel attacks

Threat description

In a typical cross-VM/Container side channel attack scenario, an adversary places a malicious VM/Container co-resident to the target VM/Container so that they share the same hardware resources. Then, the attacker extracts useful information such as cryptographic keys from the target VM/Container to use them for traffic eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Through the side channel attack, an attacker sharing the same cache as the victim can monitor the cache access behavior of the victim. For example, the attacker is able to monitor cache timing information by measuring the execution of different operations on the victim’s VM/Container. Generally, the attacker exploits timings in the shared high-level cache memory. However, power consumption or electromagnetic leaks can also be used as a vector to launch side channel attacks.

In the virtual environment, prior to the cross-VM/Container side channel attack, the attacker needs to identify the target VM/Container’s location and place a malicious VM/Container co-resident with the target. Later, that attacker may use the maliciously placed VM/Container to extract information from the target VM/Container with the side channel attack.

Hardware vulnerabilities in processors can also have a large impact on O-Cloud security. Flaws in chip design can result in the compromise of tenant information in the cloud through side-channel attacks [24].

Threats concerning O-Cloud management (SMO, NFO, FOCOM)

Threat ID

T-ADMIN-01

Threat title

Denial of service against NFO/FOCOM

Threat description

A denial-of-service attack against the NFO/FOCOM can interfere with the ability of operators to control and maintain their deployments. This can lead to the inability to react to changing resource requirements. In addition, the NFO/FOCOM is the external API to interact with the O-Cloud platform. Thus, other services may become inaccessible as well. For example, operators may be unable to retrieve logs, telemetry data. An attacker could use this opportunity to hide additional attacks on VM/Container instances.

In addition, an attacker on the NFO/FOCOM could prevents the O-Cloud software update (VNFs/CNFs, VL) to exploit a known security flaw in the O-Cloud software.

Threat ID

T-ADMIN-02

Threat title

	Abuse a O-Cloud administration service

Threat description

Usually, the SMO including NFO/FOCOM is exposed to the tenant in a web front-end or REST API. In case these interfaces contain software vulnerabilities or implement authentication and authorization insufficiently, an adversary would be able to gain access to the VM/Container management and pose as a tenant. It is also possible that an adversary gains the ability to submit requests without prior authentication and authorization.

The NFO/FOCOM interfaces encompasses a great deal of privileges because anyone gaining sufficient access is able to deploy new instances and disrupt existing O-Cloud services. It may also be possible for an adversary to submit compromised VM/Container images that unsuspecting tenants then use to initiate O-Cloud services. Moreover, adversaries can use the same access to extract business data, configuration data, user data and possibly credentials. For example, they may be able to create backups of VM/Container instances or they can export VM/Container images. The impact of compromised credentials is exacerbated by the fact that weak and insufficient safeguarding of credentials is recognized as one of the top threats in cloud computing [38].

Container example: Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container. A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment.

Container example: In Docker, adversaries may specify an entrypoint during container deployment that executes a script or command, or they may use a command such as docker exec to execute a command within a running container. In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may gain remote execution in a container in the cluster via interaction with the Kubernetes API server, the kubelet, or by running a command such as kubectl exec.

Threats concerning Acceleration Abstraction Layer (AAL)

Threat ID

T-AAL-01

Threat title

	Attacker exploits insecure API to gain access to hardware accelerator resources

Threat description

Insecure AAL API allows an attacker to tamper the requests/responses sent between the AAL components, the O-Cloud platform and O-RAN APPs/VNFs/CNFs.

For example, the attacker can tamper requests and services sent over AALI-C-Mgnt between IMS and the hardware accelerator manager, hence capability of the hardware accelerator device, fault information, logs, performance information and others are not as requested. This affects the normal operation of the O-Cloud, and even causes tampering.

An attacker can tamper application (e.g. O-DU) requests sent over AALI-C-App to an AAL implementation for allocation of buffers. This affects the normal operation of the applications, and even causes tampering.

An attacker can tamper application (e.g. O-DU) requests sent over AALI-P for configuring and managing the AAL-LPU(s). This affects the normal operation of the applications, and even causes tampering.

Threat ID

T-AAL-02

Threat title

	Internal Overload DoS attack targeting AAL services

Threat description

Overload situation could appear in the case of DoS attack or increased traffic on AAL interfaces. Inability to mitigate traffic volumetric attacks on AAL affects availability of AAL data and services.

DoS attacks on the AALI-C interface affect the different services provided by the hardware accelerator manager and the transport abstraction framework.

DoS attacks on the AALI-P interface affect the configuration and management of AAL-LPU (Acceleration Abstraction Layer Logical Processing Unit) by an application (e.g. O-DU) in addition to acceleration functionality.

Threat ID

T-AAL-03

Threat title

	Fail to clear resources

Threat description

Fail to clear accelerator resources after a process termination. This causes an information leakage and incorrect results for computations. Further, failure to release accelerator resources may prevent other processes from running.

This threat is relevant to accelerator resources either inside the hardware accelerator device (internal memories, registers, cache) or in the O-Cloud memories used by accelerators.

Threat ID

T-AAL-04

Threat title

	HAM compromise

Threat description

A malicious actor can gain access to HAM to gain unauthorized access and control of the hardware accelerator device. This can result in the disruption of services (DoS) and tampering of accelerator components, such as firmware, drivers which can cause the accelerator to behave abnormally or crash altogether.

Threat ID

T-AAL-05

Threat title

	Malicious memory accesses

Threat description

AAL that allows one process running on the hardware accelerator device to access memory owned by another process running on the hardware accelerator device can leak information (impact on confidentiality).

Similarly, AAL allowing concurrently executing processes to write to one another’s memory may have correctness errors (impact on integrity).

If multiple processes are running concurrently and one is allowed to dominate accelerator resources, the other may suffer from degraded performance. For example, if one process can evict all cache entries belonging to the other, the victim will suffer performance penalties (impact on availability).

Threat ID

T-AAL-06

Threat title

	Firmware attacks

Threat description

Hardware accelerators often have their own firmware, which can be targeted by attackers. This could include modifying the firmware to introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., malware) or installing a malicious firmware to extract/modify sensitive information or execute unauthorized actions (e.g., control the device remotely).

Threats to open source code

Open source introduces the following threats:

Threat ID

T-OPENSRC-01

Threat title

Developers use SW components with known vulnerabilities and untrusted libraries that can be exploited by an attacker through a backdoor attack

Threat description

The O-RAN Software Community is a Linux Foundation project, supported and funded by O-RAN to lead the implementation of the O-RAN specifications in Open Source. Industry has recognized that Open Source code introduces security risks. Open Source vulnerabilities are publicly available on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). While this is intended for developers to disclose vulnerabilities, it is also used by hackers to exploit those vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities frequently propagate as developers re-use free open source code enabling backdoors to attacks. There have been notable vulnerabilities from downloading open source libraries and dependencies, as well as supply chain risks when downloading Open Source code from untrusted repositories.

Some O-RAN vendors and operators may not have accurate inventories of open-source software dependencies used by their different applications, or a process to receive and manage notifications concerning discovered vulnerabilities or available patches from the community supporting the open-source.

Some O-RAN vendors may not have a lack of consistent Supply Chain traceability and security, and a lack of coding best practices conflicts with Security-by-Design principles.

Developers may use modules with known vulnerabilities and untrusted libraries that can be exploited by an attacker through a backdoor attack.

Attackers can exploit a vulnerability on the open source code and infects a hypervisor, operating system, VM or container with a malware.

Threat ID

T-OPENSRC-02

Threat title

A trusted developer intentionally inserts a backdoor into an open source code O-RAN component

Threat description

A trusted developer intentionally inserts a backdoor by injecting a few lines of malicious code into an open source code component to be used within the O-RAN system. A software project team picks up and uses the infected open source code and the development team’s tools for vetting and testing the component do not detect the malicious code. Unknowingly they have introduced a vulnerability into their O-RAN software code.

The vulnerability has gone undetected and the threat actor is able to compromise the software through the inserted vulnerability. The resulting effect on the O-RAN system can take a variety of forms, from being annoying to impacting system performance (DoS) to the loss of sensitive data.

Physical Threats

Threat ID

T-PHYS-01

Threat title

An intruder into a site gains physical access to O-RAN components to cause damage or access sensitive data

Threat description

Physical attacks on the O-RAN deployment that stores or processes keys, user plane data, control plane data and management data in cleartext.

O-RAN physical components might be vulnerable if:

Improper physical security protection of data centers, PNFs, operation areas, etc.

Improper protection to power outages (power supply)

Improper protection against environmental disasters

Improper maintenance and monitoring of hardware parameters

Hardware backdoor

Attackers try to modify the O-RAN components settings and configurations via local access.

Physical access to O-RAN components thanks to unsecured management ports and consoles (such as JTAG, serial consoles or dedicated management ports), relaxed administrator credentials management, unsecured HW and SW configuration/management could allow an attacker to inject malwares and/or manipulate existing software, steal unprotected private keys, certificates, hash values, disable security features, create a performance issue by manipulation of parameters with the purpose of eavesdropping or wiretapping on various CUS & M planes, reaching the network beyond the O-RAN or with the purpose of gaining access to the O-RAN components, denial of service, intrusion and replay attacks or other type of breaches.

Threat ID

T-PHYS-02

Threat title

Threat description

O-RU and O-DU may be located at different premises and connected through a cable network to support the fronthaul link. Attackers can gain access to, or control over, data traffic through breaching terminals in the cable landing sites (O-RU or O-DU).

Threats against 5G radio networks

Threats against 5G radio networks include:

Threat ID

T-RADIO-01

Threat title

Disruption through radio Jamming, Sniffing and Spoofing

Threat description

Like for any wireless technology, disruption through radio jamming is possible by analyzing the physical downlink and uplink control channels and signals. 5G radio network is vulnerable to:

Jamming Vulnerability of Reference Signals

Jamming Vulnerability of Synchronization Signal

Jamming Vulnerability of the PBCH

Sniffing and Spoofing Vulnerability of the PBCH

Jamming Vulnerability of PDCCH

Jamming Vulnerability of Physical Uplink Control Channel

Jamming Vulnerability of Physical Random-Access Channel

NOTE 1: The O-RAN OEMs need to develop new intelligence that can proactively alert the operator when this attack is initiated so that the operator can take appropriate actions to mitigate.

NOTE 2: In the scenario of RF spoofing, the UE needs to be able to validate the legitimacy of the O-RU as being one owned and operated by the operator. 3GPP has proposed in a study to use Digital Signatures to mitigate this threat but there has been no agreement on this to date. The O-RAN OEMs need to develop new intelligence that can proactively alert the operator when this attack is initiated so that the operator can take appropriate actions to mitigate.

Threat ID

T-RADIO-02

Threat title

DoS attacks on cognitive radio networks [17]

Threat description

Cognitive radio (CR) technology, which is designed to enhance spectrum utilization, depends on the success of opportunistic access, where unlicensed secondary users (SUs) exploit spectrum void unoccupied by primary users (PUs) for transmissions. To realize DoS attacks, malicious users (MUs) target the critical functionalities for CR ecosystems, including spectrum sensing, agile radio, and light-handed regulation since once these functionalities fail, SUs are not able to communicate effectively. For example, MUs can directly jam the victim by injecting interference or deceive SUs into believing that there is a PU by emulating the signal characteristics of the PU, thereby evacuating the occupied spectrum. Moreover, the liability rule is vulnerable to the selfish and greedy users aiming to maximize their own private benefits. Since complying with the rule results in less transmission opportunities, such SUs may not want to invest efforts to follow the rule and thus will transmit simultaneously with Pus.

Threats against ML system

This section provides the relevant threats against the ML system implemented in O-RAN architecture. The threats listed here below are generic to cover the ML model and not refined at ML components (training and inference hosts) due to the various deployment scenarios that are considered for ML architecture/framework in O-RAN. For the purposes of this document, the deployment scenarios are:

Scenario 1.1: SMO/Non-RT RIC acts as both the ML training and inference host.

Scenario 1.2: Non-RT RIC acts as the ML training host and the Near-RT RIC as the ML inference host

Scenario 1.3: Non-RT RIC acts as the ML training host and the O-CU/O-DU as the ML inference host

The involved components and interfaces within each scenario are:

Scenario 1.1: SMO/Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU, SMO internal/O1/A1 interfaces

Scenario 1.2: SMO/Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU, O1/O2/A1/E2 interfaces

Scenario 1.3: SMO/Non-RT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU, O1/O2 interfaces

Threat ID

T-ML-01

Threat title

Poisoning the ML training data (Data poisoning attacks)

Threat description

An attacker gains access to the training set of a machine learning model and alters the data (e.g. datasets that are assembled to train, test, and validate an ML system) before the training begins without the knowledge of the machine learning engineers. The training data will already be tampered with and has lost its original quality which will result in modeling on wrong data. Hence, the ML model will no longer be a reliable one since it was trained on bad data and therefore modelling, decisions, predictions, model classifications, detections, etc. will surely not be appropriate.

Also, another scenario can be in a situation where a model is online and continues to learn during operational use, modifying its behavior over time. In this case, an attacker can feed the model with bad data and the model can learn from this bad data, and as a result, negatively impact its performance and retrain the ML system to do the wrong thing.

Threat ID

T-ML-02

Threat title

Altering a machine learning model (System manipulation and compromise of ML data confidentiality and privacy)

Threat description

An attacker can illegally access a machine learning model and alter its parameters and thereby influence how it produces results. This can lead to wrong prediction and might result in catastrophic decisions if the results of the predictions were being used to make key business decisions.

Also, an attacker can extract sensitive or confidential data that, through training, are built right into the ML model.

Threat ID

T-ML-03

Threat title

Transfer learning attack

 Threat description on

A transfer learning attack is a risk when an ML system is built by fine-tuning a pretrained model that is widely available. An attacker could use the public model as a cover for their malicious ML behavior.

For more information about ML security risks and controls, see the risk analysis of ML systems released by BIML [18].

Protocol Stack Threats

The A1 and R1 interfaces use the REST protocol stack shown in the figure below.  The transport network layer is built on IP transport. TCP provides the communication service at the transport layer.  HTTP is the application-level protocol used providing reliable transport of messages.  TLS provides secure HTTP connections for secure transport of messages.  The application layer protocol is based on a RESTful approach with transfer of JSON formatted policy statements. Each of these protocols has known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a malicious actor.

Security principles

This clause elucidates security principles that an O-RAN system should achieve. They provide high level and abstract statement of the intended solution to countering potential Threats. Each security principle references applicable ZT tenets.

Principles (SP)

SP-AUTH Mutual Authentication

Mutual authentication SHOULD be established to allow the O-RAN system verifying who performs what, thus possible to detect fake base stations, unauthorized or malicious components, malicious applications and malicious users/administrators.

ZT Tenets: ZT-2, ZT-3, ZT-4, ZT-6

SP-ACC Access Control

The O-RAN system SHOULD forbid unauthorized administrators or components to access O-RAN resources or services anytime and anywhere. Access controls are required for:

Network Access Controls for filtering unauthorized/unexpected traffic in the O-RAN components over their interfaces.

Access controls to restrict access to component configurations.

Access controls for hardware to maintain the trust chain.

ZT Tenets: ZT-3, ZT-4, ZT-6

SP-CRYPTO Secure cryptographic, key management and PKI

Well-known, standardized, secure and unbroken cryptographic schemes and protocols SHOULD be used. Proprietary schemes and protocols SHOULD be avoided.

A secure key management of O-RAN keys (KgNB, KRRC-enc, KRRC-int, KUP-int, and KUP-enc, ksn) SHOULD be implemented to manage all the steps of key lifecycle: key generation using an appropriate level of entropy from a reliable source, secure key storage, key rotation and revocation, secure key destruction, etc.

Reliable PKI for authentication and data encryption SHOULD be used. Public CAs SHOULD be supported. The certificates SHOULD be issued by a trusted or rooted Certificate Authority (CA). The CA implements the Certificate Policy which specifies the rules and policies about who may or may not receive a Certificate. Relying parties can access the Certificate Policy to determine what validation/verification checks were performed prior to certificate issuance.

Each O-RU SHOULD be configured with lists of algorithms which are allowed for usage. There SHOULD be one list for integrity algorithms, and one for ciphering algorithms. These lists SHOULD be ordered according to a priority decided by the operator.

SP-TCOMM Trusted Communication

Integrity, confidentiality, availability, authenticity and replay protection of resources SHOULD be ensured in transit (see ‘Critical Assets’, clause 6.3) over O-RAN interfaces.

ZT Tenets: ZT-2

SP-SS Secure storage

Integrity, confidentiality, availability protection of O-RAN resources SHOULD be ensured at rest (see ‘Critical Assets’, clause 6.3).

SP-SB Secure boot and self-configuration

O-RAN components SHOULD secure their firmware and configuration to provide the opportunity for trust to be extended higher in the software stack. Verified platform firmware can, in turn, verify the operating system (OS) boot loader, which can then verify other software components all the way up to the OS itself, the hypervisor or container runtime layers and O-RAN components. The transitive trust SHOULD be consistent with the concept of the chain of trust (CoT)-a method where each piece of code in the boot process measures and checks the signature of the next stage of the boot process before the software boots.

The secure boot process, signature verification and self-configuration SHOULD be securely implemented for all O-RAN components to authenticate them before loading.

SP-UPDT Secure Update

A secure update management process SHOULD be implemented for introducing a new component or software change into the O-RAN system. The process SHOULD consider the ability to update the cryptographic algorithms and to adapt to upcoming O-RAN security challenges. A timely update cycles if vulnerabilities are discovered SHOULD be in place.

ZT Tenets: ZT-5

SP-RECO Recoverability & Backup

A recoverability process to recovery in case of denial of service SHOULD be implemented. An approach for detecting and mitigating DoS attacks SHOULD be in place.

O-RAN vendors SHOULD define a recovery plan that resets the O-RAN components to a trustworthy state in case of a malfunction or an attack (e.g. DoS).

Backup systems SHOULD be in place to allow data or component on the O-RAN to be secured. Backup systems SHOULD ensure a suitable level of data or component availability and reliability.

ZT Tenets: ZT-7

SP-OPNS Security management of risks in open-source components

Vendors using open-source code SHOULD enhance its security by applying industry coding best practices. It is recommended that vendors practice a higher level of due diligence for exposure to public exploits when using Open-Source code.

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) SHOULD be maintained to track which open-source components are in use and where.

Security Analysis (Audit, vulnerability scan, etc.) SHOULD be performed to ensure all identified components are free of security vulnerabilities.

A proper policy and process SHOULD be in place for identifying and patching known issues with the open-source components. Open-source software components SHOULD be kept up to date and patched.

ZT Tenets: ZT-5

SP-ASSU Security Assurance

Mobile networks are classified as critical infrastructure making security assurance especially more than relevant:

Vendors SHOULD ensure and prove that its software or hardware meets 3GPP Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS).

Vendors SHOULD ensure and prove that its software or hardware fulfils O-RAN security tests, requirements and recommendations provided by O-RAN alliance.

Vendors SHOULD ensure and prove that their software or hardware meets the needs of many national and international cybersecurity regulations, such as the Cyber Act, GDPR, etc.

Vendors SHOULD provide risk assessment, secure code review, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis and hardening guidelines for their O-RAN components.

SP-PRV Privacy

In O-RAN, the privacy of end users SHOULD be considered. The privacy of end users can be divided into data privacy, identity privacy and personal information privacy. Most Communication services are to gather data and personal information around end users, which may reveal information sensitive to their privacy. Adversaries would further extract more personal information about end users, such as UE priority, location information, trajectory, and preference.

SP-SLC Continuous security development, testing, logging, monitoring and vulnerability handling

Continuous development and continuous integration (CD/CI) with continuous regression testing and software security auditing SHOULD be implemented.

Relevant activities events SHOULD be logged and logs collected SHOULD be analyzed in real time for the identification of potential security attacks and for security auditing.

Continuous monitoring SHOULD be implemented to verify that the wanted security state is maintained throughout the lifecycle of deployed O-RAN components.

Vulnerability management SHOULD be in place with intelligence to continuously track, identify and remediate vulnerable applications. Vendors SHOULD keep track of any new vulnerabilities discovered and is ready to act on customer product security incidents and reported security issues affecting O-RAN components.

ZT Tenets: ZT-7

SP-ISO Robust Isolation

In a multi-vendor environment, intra-domain host isolation SHOULD be enforced. In the same host, VMs, CNs, virtualization/container layer, CPU, storage, and network security isolation of resources SHOULD be ensured by implementing system security orchestration, segmentation, lifecycle management, time scheduling, monitoring and audit on the management, signaling, control and data planes, and the execution of virtualized O-RAN components.

SP-PHY Physical security

The O-RAN system SHOULD be located at physically secure environment in a way that minimizes the risk of resource theft and destruction. It SHOULD support secure storage of sensitive data (cryptographic keys and configuration data), execution of sensitive functions (encryption/decryption, authentication), and execution of boot and update processes.

Special attention SHOULD be paid to the site intrusion and physical access threats against O-RU sites. Consequently O-RU equipment SHOULD disable all unnecessary physical and logical ports, protocols and interfaces. In addition, secure physical connections to O-RU for O&M operations SHOULD be implemented (e.g. secure laptop with secure credentials).

SP-CLD Secure cloud computing and virtualization

Defense methods SHOULD be implemented: virtual machine-based intrusion detection, virtual machine-based isolation, virtual machine-based kernel protection, virtual machine-based access control, and virtual machine-based trusted computing.

SP-ROB Robustness

The O-RAN system SHOULD not only ensure the robustness of software or hardware resources, but also guarantee the robustness of the cognitive radio channel for meeting the QoS of communication services required by users. In some scenarios, the robustness of spectrum sensing SHOULD be enhanced when some sensing nodes (e.g., O-RU) easily malfunction. Robustness is an essential consideration for overcoming the security threats caused by jamming, DoS or DDoS attacks.

Risk assessment

After identifying the list of assets, threats and vulnerabilities, the next step is the risk assessment. The main concepts of risk assessment are illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 91 : Main concepts of risk assessment

The criticality of the identified threats in clause 7.4 were assessed based on the severity (consequence) and the likelihood of occurrence. Indications of severity level for each threat are given whether they are considered as high, medium, or low. This severity is a global perception of the risk based on its impacts. In practice, it varies strongly depending on the use cases and deployment/configuration models of the O-RAN system.

Moreover, the type of loss (availability, integrity and/ or confidentiality) has been assessed for each threat.

Determination of severity level process

The process followed to determine the severity level resulting from threats that successfully exploit vulnerabilities is based on Table 9-1 which includes the definition in terms of Privacy, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability of the three severity levels ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ and ‘High’ shown here as green, yellow and red.

Table 9-1 defines what “low,” “medium” and “high” means.

The severity of an impact is expressed as follows:

Level of impact for various threats on the properties Privacy, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

Scale of impact, depending on the number of affected O-RUs and /or O-DUs.

Scale of impact depending on the Clock Model and Synchronization Topology configurations LLS-C1, LLS-C2, LLS-C3 and LLS-C4 [10].

Adverse impacts depending on whether or not existing requirments and controls are already defined in the O-RAN requirments specifications.

Table 91 : Severity rating

Severity level

Privacy

Confidentiality

Integrity

Availability

Number of affected O-RUs/O-DUs (Only for Threats on O-RU, O-DU, FH interface)

Clock Model and Synchronization Topology configurations (only for Threats on S-PLANE)

Adverse impacts

Low

Disclosure of personal data which, with aggregation or processing, is unlikely to reveal unique subscriber’s identity.

Disclosure of information for internal use. No specific impact on its disclosure

Minor/Unnoticeable effect on system behavior/output

Brief Interruption in operations. (Estimated in secs/mins/hours)

One O-DU is affected with its related O-RU

DoS attacks on LLS-C2

DoS attacks on LLS-C4

Already existing requirements and controls are defined in the O-RAN specifications to prevent, or at least significantly impede, the vulnerability from being exercised. Existing requirements and controls are only efficient to protect from both internal and external threats.

Medium

Disclosure of personal data (according to GDPR) which CAN be processed or aggregated to uniquely identify subscribers.

NOTE: Personal data in GDPR means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Disclosure of privileged information Access credentials/ configuration data, etc.

Alteration of some system functionality and features/output.

Short-term Interruption in operations. (Estimated in hours/Days)

One O-DU is affected with its related multiple O-RUs

DoS attacks on LLS-C1

Already existing requirements and controls are defined in the O-RAN specifications to prevent, or at least significantly impede, the vulnerability from being exercised. Existing requirements and controls are only efficient to protect from external threats.

High

Disclosure of sensitive personal data (GDPR special category).

NOTE: Special data category in GDPR: data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

Disclosure of high value information, trade secrets, IP, mission critical data, master-keys, etc.

Complete change in normal System functioning

Prolonged interruption of operations. (Estimated in days/Weeks)

Several O-DUs and O-RUs are affected

DoS attacks on LLS-C3

No existing requirements and controls in the ORAN specifications yet to protect from internal and/or external threats

NOTE 1: The severity level depends on the number of affected RUs and O-DUs. The severity level is consequently 'Low' in case of one affected O-RU, 'Medium' in case of one affected O-DU with its related multiple O-RUs, and 'High' for multiple affected O-DUs-O-RUs. Operators conducting a full risk analysis according to this report should conduct a use case-based analysis taking into account the likelihood and the real deployment of the O-RAN system.

NOTE 2:

Configuration LLS-C1

In LLS-C1, the network timing is distributed from O-DU to O-RU via direct connection between O-DU site and O-RU site. O-DU is acting as a master and directly synchronizes O-RU.

DoS attacks against the master clock: There are two scenarios:

1.     Scenario 1: One O-RU is served by O-DU, therefore only one O-RU is affected. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.

2.     Scenario 2: Multiple O-RUs are served by O-DU, therefore all those O-RUs are affected as the connection between O-DU and O-RU is point-to-point. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.

Configuration LLS-C2

In LLS-C2, the network timing is distributed from O-DU to O-RU between O-DU sites and O-RU sites. One or more Ethernet switches are allowed in the fronthaul network. O-DU acting as master to distribute network timing toward O-RU.

DoS attacks against the master clock within the O-DU may affect one or multiple O-RUs. In this configuration, a neighbor O-DU could act a backup and play the role of a master to distribute network timing to all the RUs belonging to the affected O-DU by reconfiguring the network of switches. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.

Configuration LLS-C3

Frequency and time distribution is made by the fronthaul network itself (not by the O-DU). One or more PRTC/T-GM are implemented in the fronthaul network to distribute network timing toward O-DU and O-RU.

DoS attacks against the master clock within the fronthaul network may affect multiple O-DUs with their related O-RUs. Consequently, the severity level is ‘High’.

Configuration LLS-C4

	Local PRTC timing that provides time synchronization to the O-RU (it could be embedded in the O-RU).

DoS attacks against the master clock may affect only one O-RU. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.

	According to what we described in the here above two notes, T-SPLANE-01 has been split in Table 9-4 according to the Clock Model and Synchronization Topology configurations C1, C2, C3, and C4.

	NOTE: Adverse impacts: This factor depends on the normative O-RAN security requirements in the security requirements specification. For a threat without any requirement in front of it, the adverse impacts level is High. It is Medium or Low for a threat with related security requirements (see column ‘Assupltions’) helping in reducing its impact.

Determination of likelihood level process

The process followed to determine the likelihood level resulting from threats that successfully exploit vulnerabilities is based on Table 9-2 which includes the relevant factors that are considered. For each factor, three levels ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ and ‘High’ are shown in Table 9-2 as green, yellow and red.

Table 9-2 defines what “low,” “medium” and “high” means.

The likelihood level is expressed by four factors as follows:

Adverse impacts: This factor depends on the existing normative O-RAN security requirements and controls. For example, the level is high in case no available O-RAN security requirements and controls in the O-RAN security specifications. In the risk assessment Table 9-4 in the column ‘Assumptions’, some of the agreed security controls by the O-RAN alliance have been stated for some threats as arguments for justifying the likelihood levels ‘Low’ or ‘Medium. This means that the likelihood level is estimated at Low’ or ‘Medium’, provided that the security controls are in place.

NOTE: This factor is used to determine the likelihood level for the most categories of threats. It is also used as a relevant factor for severity for some categories of threats, in particular the O-Cloud threats category.

Threat event initiation: This factor takes into consideration the capabilities that attackers possess and the potential entry points to exploit a vulnerability and initiate an attack. For example, it is high if an attack can be initiated from internet or untrusted network.

Exposure: This factor is related to the number of external interfaces and/or services that are exposed to an attacker.

Zero Trust Approach: Likelihood scoring considers a zero-trust architecture which protects against internal threat actors.  Likelihood scores are higher for a zero-trust architecture (ZTA) because internal threats should be considered in addition to external threats. In a ZTA it cannot be assumed that perimeter defense is sufficient.  As a result, scored Likelihood = Medium, at a minimum.   Reconnaissance type attacks can be scored Likelihood = High while damaging/availability attacks can be scored Likelihood = Medium.  The reason is that threat actors are less likely to perform damaging attacks that are quickly and easily detected. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) typically move laterally in anonymous fashion to prevent detection while providing reconnaissance (see O-RAN.SFG.Non-RT-RIC-Security-TR-v01.00).

Evaluation of the risks process

The following risk assessment matrix is used to assess the risk score. The matrix takes as input two estimated qualitative inputs: (i) likelihood and (ii) the severity. One axis representing the probability of a risk scenario occurring and the other representing the damage it will cause (Severity). In the middle, you have scores based on their combined totals.

Using this formula RISK= Severity x Likelihood by a simple multiply the severity and likelihood scores to obtain the final risk score as shown in Table 9-3.

For example, if the estimated likelihood of a threat is low and the corresponding severity is high, then the risk is medium.
