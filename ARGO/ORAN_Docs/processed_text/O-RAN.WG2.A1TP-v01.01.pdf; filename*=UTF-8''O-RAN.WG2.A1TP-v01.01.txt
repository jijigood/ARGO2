2.3 Functions and protocol stack 20
The following layers of the protocol stack for A1 interface are described in the following chapters:  21
- TCP [4] provides the communication service at the transport layer; 22
- TLS [5][6] is used to provide secure HTTP [7][8] connections; 23
- HTTP [9][10] is used as application level protocol; 24
- The data interchange layer constitutes the transport of documents in the JSON format [11]. 25
Figure 2.3-1 illustrates the protocol stack of the A1 interface. 26

Chapter 3 Network layer 4
A1 may be transported over IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 [12]) and/or IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [13]). 5
Chapter 4 Transport layer 6
TCP (IETF RFC 793 [4]) shall be used as transport protocol. 7
NOTE: When using TCP as the transport protocol, an HTTP connection is mapped to a TCP connection.  8
Both Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC may act as HTTP client and HTTP server. As a result, Non-RT RIC and Near-RT 9
RIC may establish a TCP connection for each direction. This permits bidirectional communication. 10
Chapter 5 Security 11
For the security protection at the transport layer, TLS v1.2 (IETF RFC 5246 [5]) shall be supported, and TLS v1.3 12
(IETF RFC 8446 [6]) should be supported. 13
Chapter 6 Application 14
As application layer, HTTP/1.1 (IETF RFC 7231 [9]) shall be supported, and HTTP/2 (IETF RFC 7540 [10]) should be 15
supported. 16
HTTP over TLS (as defined in IETF RFC 2818 [7] and updated in IETF RFC 7230 [8]) shall be supported. 17
HTTP details such as standard headers, custom headers, error codes, methods , URIs etc are specified in A1 interface: 18
Application Protocol [2]. 19
The default TCP port numbers should be used for HTTP operation. 20

Chapter 7 Data interchange 1
As a data interchange format, JSON (IETF RFC 8259 [11]) shall be supported. The objects transported in HTTP 2
messages, and the data types in JSON format, are specified in A1 interface: Type Definitions [3].  3
Annex ZZZ : O-RAN Adopter License Agreement 4
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O -RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER 5
AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 6
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O -RAN Alliance and the 7
entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”). 8
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification. 9
Section 1: DEFINITIONS 10
1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with 11
another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of 12
fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity. 13
1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether implemented in ha rdware, 14
software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification. 15
1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their 16
Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications. 17
1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does 18
not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O -RAN 19
Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates. 20
1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design 21
patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are o wned or otherwise licensable by a Member, 22
Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) 23
such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment  of 24
consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering 25
any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible 26
on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art 27
generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O -RAN Alliance or the date the patent 28
claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate 29
a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a 30
Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent 31
claims shall be considered Necessary Claims. 32
1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, 33
Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term 34
allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the 35
licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates. 36
Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE 37
2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, 38
nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN 39
Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in 40
furtherance of implementations of an ORAN 41
Specification. 42
2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written 43
agreement with O-RAN Alliance. 44

Section 3: FRAND LICENSE 1
3.1 Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separat e 2
Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non - Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and 3
conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to 4
Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, 5
use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such 6

3.2 Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has 12
reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter 13
is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and 14
its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees. 15
3.3 Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License 16
Agreement to each Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates under Fair 17
Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a 18
nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent 19
license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute 20
Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license will not e xtend: (a) to any part or function of a 21
product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or 22

licensed Compliant Implementations. 27
Section 4: TERM AND TERMINATION 28
4.1 This Agreement shall remain in force, unless early terminated according to this Section 4. 29
4.2 O-RAN Alliance on behalf of its Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors may terminate this Agreement 30
if Adopter materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure or is not capable of curing such breach within thi rty 31
(30) days after being given notice specifying the breach. 32
4.3 Sections 1, 3, 5 - 11 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Under surviving Section 3, 33
after termination of this Agreement, Adopter will continue to grant licens es (a) to entities who become Adopters after 34
the date of termination; and (b) for future versions of ORAN Specifications that are backwards compatible with the 35
version that was current as of the date of termination. 36
Section 5: CONFIDENTIALITY 37
Adopter will use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication, and dissemination of O -RAN 38
Specifications to third parties, as Adopter employs with its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable 39
care. Any disclosure by Adopter to its Affiliates, contractors and consultants should be subject to an obligation of 40
confidentiality at least as restrictive as those contained in this Section. The foregoing obligation shall not apply to any 41
information which is: (1) rightfully known by Adopter without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to disclosure; 42
(2) publicly available through no fault of Adopter; (3) rightfully received without a duty of confidentiality; (4) disclosed 43
by O-RAN Alliance or a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor to a third party without a duty of 44
confidentiality on such third party; (5) independently developed by Adopter; (6) disclosed pursuant to the order of a 45
court or other authorized governmental body, or as required by law, provided that Adopter provides reasona ble prior 46
written notice to O-RAN Alliance, and cooperates with O-RAN Alliance and/or the applicable Member, Contributor or 47
Academic Contributor to have the opportunity to oppose any such order; or (7) disclosed by Adopter with O -RAN 48
Alliance’s prior written approval. 49
