Service Enumeration/ Network Boundary Examination
STC-7-7.2-001: Service Enumeration
Requirement Name: Network protocols and services
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.3.3, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications 4.0 [5]
Requirement Description: A list of network protocols and services supported on the O-RAN component shall be clearly documented by its vendor. Unused protocols shall be disabled.
Threat References: T-O-RAN-01, T-O-RAN-02
O-RAN Component References: SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test description and applicability
Service enumeration is the discovery of network services that are managed or handled by the DUT. Service enumeration for O-RAN component first requires both internal and external "port scans" to discover ports that are servicing application and network protocols.
TCP Port Scanning
Sending a TCP SYN packet to each port. A response with SYN/ACK indicates "port open"
SCTP Port Scanning
Sending a SCTP INIT packet to each possible port. A response with INIT_ACK indicates "port open"
UDP Port Scanning
Sending a UDP packet containing data to each port. A non-response of ICMP Port Unreachable indicates that a service MIGHT be listening.
After each set of ports is scanned, a set of service discovery protocol handshake attempts should be sent to validate if a service is listening or available. For each port, the most likely protocol(s) should be sent to validate if they are present and flagged. If there is a non-match, the data received should be reported in both hexadecimal form and ASCII printable. A few examples:
A TCP port on port 80 is discovered as "open". An HTTP 1.1 GET should be sent, as well as a HTTP2 GET
UDP Port 69 was deemed open. A TFTP read for a random file should be sent, looking for a TFTP ERROR Packet.
SCTP port 38412 was discovered as open. A NG Reset packet should be sent to that port looking for the appropriate response.
Test setup and configuration
This test shall use an allow-list of network services provided by DUT. The allow-list is used to compare against the list of actual identified network service(s) on the DUT produced as a result of the test.
The O-RAN component(s) listed in the reference above shall be the DUT. The allow-list shall be provided by vendor(s) of DUT prior to the test.
Test procedure
Scan the IP address of the DUT for listening TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports.
For each port determined to be listening, send the expected network handshake typically used on that port, and identify the service offered.
Test requirements (expected results)
A list of enumerated ports and services on the DUT. Anything that is not included in the allow-list should have an explanation provided as to why it is available and what purpose(s) it serves.

Network Protocol Fuzzing
Fuzzing is an automated process of sending invalid or random inputs to a SUT to cause it to malfunction or crash.
Fuzzing is effective for finding vulnerabilities because while most modern programs have extensive input fields, the test coverage of these areas is relatively small. Even though this process can be a powerful capability to ensure robustness, it needs to be sufficiently defined and implemented throughout the system development lifecycle to be helpful and achieve the required results in a multi-vendor environment.
While traditional fuzzing techniques involve fuzzing piece(s) of software and generating inputs through command line or input files, fuzzing telecommunication network protocols tends to be different, requiring sending information via network ports. Furthermore, the complex nature of network protocols in the SUT resulting from how they are layered over each other adds to the challenges of fuzzing such SUTs.
In the case of O-RAN SUT, fuzzing cover protocols rather than application-specific (web applications and services, etc.). The following are examples of the protocols that fuzzing will cover;
and
It is anticipated that many O-RAN components utilize common software frameworks used for the lower-level general communication. In this case it should be evaluated if these General Transport Protocols are being tested in extensive Fuzzing tests in other activities and can therefore be considered to have lower risk profiles compared to the O-RAN Specific Protocols with less testing in the general industry.
Many of the O-RAN specific protocols are state- machine based protocols that can have multiple end points served at the same time, e.g. the protocol needs to be tested in scale to understand if possible memory leaks or other similar aspects is available that could lead to buffer overflows (opening up for possible code execution) or software crashes of the O-RAN specific software.
Fuzzing on the M-Plane protocol inside the Configuration of the O-RAN Fronthaul can be a possible significant area as this is combining multiple technologies from many domains into a single solution. In order for the Fuzzing to be time and resource efficient, it is important that this Fuzzing is protocol and state machine aware so that the Fuzzing can focus on the relevant aspects of the SUT representing the most significant risk exposure. Further effectiveness can be achieved if the Fuzzing capability is able to intelligently respond to the SUT behavior. The Fuzzing tool should be able to both perform test with and without access to relevant credentials. Many possible vulnerabilities would be present on the inside of the authenticated session of the management protocols and would lead to escalation of privileges.
In order to identify the possible risk for memory leaks, Denial of Service (DoS) or other similar aspects a robust logging of the underlying platform (hardware and software), the virtualization or container platform and the O-RAN function, the logging needs to be detailed enough to evaluate the trends early but not intrusive to degrade the performance of the platform and lead to inaccurate results.
As general guidance, vendors and operators running fuzzing tests aim to document the list of all of the protocols of the SUTs reachable externally on an IP-based interface, together with indications of whether adequate available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used against them. The tool's name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), user settings, and the relevant output evidenced and should be documented. Additionally, any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behavior and a description of this behavior should be highlighted in the testing documentation.
Since fuzzing test cases are not exhaustive and difficult to define and replicate, it's likely that test results even from testing the same set of protocols by different vendors may end up resulting in different outputs. So further effort and time needs to be invested in fuzzing activities until a satisfactory approach based on the vendor's or/and operators adopted risk-based model is satisfied.

Security test of SMO
Overview
This chapter contains security tests to validate the security protection mechanism specific to SMO.
O1 Interface Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) Validation
Following zero trust principles, O-RAN O1 interface shall enforce confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity through an encrypted transport, and shall support least privilege access control using the network configuration access control model. The network configuration access control model (NACM) [14] provides the means to restrict access for users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.
The security test case in this section validates the NACM enforcement on the O-RAN component O1 interface for the role-based access control.
STC-17-17.2-001: O1 Interface NACM Validation
Requirement Name: O1 Interface security requirements
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.2.2.1, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications 4.0 [5]
Requirement Description: Requirements of O1 Interface Confidentiality, Integrity & Authenticity protection and Least Privilege Access Control
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-06
O-RAN Component References: Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU
Test description and applicability
O-RAN component(s) managed by SMO through O1 interface shall support secured NETCONF sessions over TLS and role-based least privilege access control enforced by NACM [14]. This test validates the O1 interface security requirements of the O-RAN component(s) with the focus on role-based NACM rule(s) set enforcement.
Test setup and configuration
DUT shall be the O-RAN component with:
IP enabled O1 interface, reachable to the authentication server;
Valid certificate loaded for the server and necessary certificate authorities (CAs)
Client’s root CA required to validate NETCONF client certificate
Valid TLS Client-to-NETCONF username mapping
Test procedure
First set up a host/device with TLS client software installed, valid client certificates, keys, root CA certificate for the server (O-RAN component), and all intermediate CA certificates required to validate the client certificate.
The following test steps shall be validated:
Start the NETCONF-over-TLS session using OpenSSL s_client command to connect with DUT O1 interface using TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 if available with a user account from the O1_nacm_management group
Verify the session is established and mapped to the correct NETCONF user
Verify the global NACM enforcement control setting of
enable-nacm = true
read-default = permit
write-default = deny
exec-default = deny
enable-external-groups = true
Verify the NACM rule sets for the following pre-defined groups
O1_nacm_management
O1_user_management
O1_network_management
O1_network_monitoring
O1_software_management
Close the NETCONF session and TLS connection
Upon availability of the NETCONF operations set(s) definition per NACM group, the NACM rule set(s) enforcement by the DUT shall be validated for each of those pre-defined groups listed above.
Test requirements (expected results)
The O-RAN component shall support the NETCONF over TLS session over its O1 interface and NACM enforcement control settings.
