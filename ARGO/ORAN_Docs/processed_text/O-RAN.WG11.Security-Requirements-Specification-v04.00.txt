Security Controls
API Security – Authentication
REST APIs and gRPC APIs are being considered as valid network solutions for Near-RT RIC APIs. REST APIs use HTTP and support Transport Layer Security (TLS). REST APIs utilizes JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as encoding protocol. gRPC APIs use HTTP/2 and support as well TLS. In contrast with REST APIs, gRPC use Protobuf as encoding protocol.
Time critical E2 related APIs are currently specified to run over SCTP/Protobuf network protocol stack. The security network layer specified for E2 interface is IPsec (see SEC-CTL-E2).
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-1: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC) shall support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication via X.509v3 certificates. Client authentication, as specified in rfc 5246 (TLS 1.2) and rfc8446 (TLS 1.3), shall be used. Both the client (e.g., xApp as API consumer) and the server (e.g., Near-RT RIC platform as API producer) require a certificate, and both sides authenticate each other using their public/private key pair.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-2: Time critical APIs (e.g., E2 related APIs), not supported by TLS protocol, shall support IPsec with IKEv2 certificated-based authentication according to O-RAN security protocol specification [3].
API Security – Authorization
Authorization is the function of specifying and enforcing access rights or privileges to certain resources or services. In the actual context of Near-RT RIC, the platform as API producer shall be responsible to specify those rights/privileges for the platform services as resources to the xApps as consumers. As a guideline, an xApp should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more.
Authorization mechanisms shall be enforced by the Near-RT RIC platform in the following key API procedures [33]:
Discovery of Near-RT RIC APIs: The Near-RT RIC platform shall provide means to restrict xApps from discovery of some published APIs based on configuration policies.
E2 Subscription API procedure: The subscription management shall be based on operator’s policies. An xApp may be restricted to interface with only a subset of E2 Nodes by such policies. This procedure establishes a set of preconditions that assume authorization proccesses:
xApp has been authorized to issue E2 Subscription API requests
xApp has been authorized to request guidance from Conflict mitigation
xApp Subscription Management has been configured to permit E2 Subscription API requests only from specific list of xApps.
E2 Control API procedure: Only authorized xApps may initiate RIC control request messages issued by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Nodes, for a specific scope (e.g, E2 Node list, RAN function, etc.).
E2 Guidance API procedure: The purpose of this procedure only authorized xApp to obtain guidance from the conflict mitigation platform function prior to initiating an action.
SDL API procedures: The precondition to consume the services exposed by SDL API (e.g, client registration, fetch data, notification, store, etc.) is that xApps have been successfully registered and authorized.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-3: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC)  in Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 authorization framework as specified in in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.
The roles defined in OAuth 2.0 are assigned as follows:
Resource owner / Resource server (producer): Near-RT RIC platform modules providing services via APIs
Client (consumer): xApp
Grants shall be of the type Client Credentials Grant, as described in clause 4.4. of RFC 6749. Client authentication as specified in rfc 5246 (TLS 1.2) and rfc8446 (TLS1.3) shall be used.
SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-4: For A1-P, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7, for service requests received from a Non-RT RIC.
SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-5: For A1-EI, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 client, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.

Security Controls
Editor’s notes: This section will be updated in subsequent versions of the security requirements specification
Software Package Protection at the O-Cloud Network Functions and Applications Layer
The identified requirements and controls in this section are enforcing the protection of O-Cloud App/VNF/CNF packages at the application layer, i.e., xApp, rApp, O-CU, O-DU, Near RT RIC.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-1: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be certified by the App/VNF/CNF Provider using industry recognized software testing suites (e.g., vulnerability scanning, static and dynamic testing, penetration testing) to find any flaws and defects within the package and to eliminate them before its delivery to the Service Provider. Test results shall be shared with the Service Provider.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-2: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be signed by the App/VNF/CNF Provider prior to its delivery to the Service Provider for ensuring its authenticity and integrity. To provide the authenticity and integrity protection for the whole App/VNF/CNF package, one of the two following options shall be followed according to [41], [42]:
Option 1: The App/VNF/CNF package contains a Digest (a.k.a. hash) for each of the artifacts of the App/VNF/CNF package. The table of hashes is signed with the App/VNF/CNF provider private key.
Option 2: The complete App/VNF/CNF package is signed with the App/VNF/CNF provider private key.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-3: The App/VNF/CNF package shall include minimally the following artifacts according to [41], [42]: the App/VNF/CNF software image, the signing certificate, and signature(s) of App/VNF/CNF Provider.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-4: If the App/VNF/CNF package refers to external artifacts [41], [42], those artifacts shall be signed by the App/VNF/CNF Provider and their signatures shall be verified by the Service Provider.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-5: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be validated by NFO upon its reception using the signature generated and provided by the App/VNF/CNF Provider.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-6: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be tested by the Service Provider for known security vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerability scanning). All discovered vulnerabilities must be reported and remediated where possible.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-7: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be cryptographically bound to one Telco Operator before its on-boarding to the O-Cloud images repository. This will prevent unauthorized package to be instantiated even if it has valid App/VNF/CNF certificate [41], [44], [45].
Note:
As multiple App/VNF/CNF Providers will be involved in the delivery of various O-RAN network functions, Telco Operators need to verify and manage multiple App/VNF/CNF Providers signatures. Telco Operator may not have implicit trust relationship with all App/VNF/CNF Providers. There shall be a trust O-Cloud images repository, where App/VNF/CNF packages can be securely stored and bound to one Telco Operator. This trust and bound could be ensured by signing the App/VNF/CNF package before its on-boarding to the O-Cloud images repository by the Service Provider without affecting the signature of the App/VNF/CNF Provider.
Signing of the App/VNF/CNF package by the Service provider prior to its onboarding is required for the following reasons:
For checking the App/VNF/CNF provider signature during the App/VNF/CNF instantiation it is not needed that the O-Cloud Platform contact the App/VNF/CNF provider outside of the service provider's security domain.
Give the Telco operator the opportunity and means to authorize App/VNF/CNF Packages for deployment on its network (e.g., avoid an App/VNF/CNF package intended for one Telco Operator with a valid App/VNF/CNF provider certificate being loaded by an attacker into another network operator's).
Furthermore, some Telco Operators might wish to undertake additional security validation of the App/VNF/CNF package during the onboarding process and operator's signing could be used to certify the App/VNF/CNF as authorized to onboard into the operator's network.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-8: App/VNF/CNF packages shall be successfully authenticated and verified during instantiation to the O-Cloud Platform from the trust O-Cloud images repository using signatures from both App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-9: Signatures made from certificates reaching the end of their lifetime shall be renewed before the certificate times out (signatures provided by the App/VNF/CNF Provider might be ignored if the signature of the Service Provider is valid). App/VNF/CNF packages during instantiation that do not include valid certificates shall be removed from the O-Cloud images repository and from any type of O-Cloud Platform memory.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-10: App/VNF/CNF packages stored within the O-Cloud images repository shall be integrity and confidentiality protected.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-11: App/VNF/CNF packages stored within the O-Cloud images repository shall be accessible to only authorized actors (e.g., authorized users and authorized systems) and over secure networks that enforce authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-12: O-Cloud images repository shall be clear of vulnerable App/VNF/CNF packages and of packages with expired or missing certificates.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-13: App/VNF/CNF package artifacts/configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., LI Apps/VNFs/CNFs, keys, PII, passwords or other critical configuration data) shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure at rest and in transit.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-14: NFO shall contain a pre-installed root certificate of trusted CA (trusted by the Telco Operator) before the on-boarding of the App/VNF/CNF package for verifying its authenticity and integrity. Root certificate shall be delivered via a trusted channel separately from an App/VNF/CNF package [42].
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-15: App/VNF/CNF Packages shall contain a Change Log. Change log captures the changes from one version to another including but not limited to features added/removed, issues fixed as well as known issues not resolved [43].
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-16: O-Cloud Platform shall monitor stored App/VNF/CNF Packages downloaded from the O-Cloud images repository within SMO to the O-Cloud platform to determine if any unauthorized modification, deletion, or insertion has occurred.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-17: SMO and O-Cloud Platform shall support a strong protection of keys and algorithms for the code signing and encryption/decryption process.
Security Controls
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-1: App/VNF/CNF package signature generation/verification for integrity and authenticity protection
Responsible: App/VNF/CNF Provider, Service Provider
A signed App/VNF/CNF package is delivered to the Service Provider containing the App/VNF/CNF package, the signing X.509v3 certificate, and the signature (signed hash value) of App/VNF/CNF Provider.
The root CA certificate must be pre-installed within the NFO for the validation of the App/VNF/CNF Provider signing certificate.
Upon reception of the signed App/VNF/CNF package from App/VNF/CNF Provider by the Service Provider:
A new hash of the received App/VNF/CNF package is calculated and verified by the Service Provider against the hash in the signature using the App/VNF/CNF Provider certificate retrieved from the received App/VNF/CNF package.
Verification is successful if both hash values match.
Service Provider signs the verified App/VNF/CNF package prior to its onboarding to the trust O-Cloud images repository
Service Provider computes the hash value of the App/VNF/CNF package and the signature of the App/VNF/CNF Provider.
The hash value is signed with the private key(s) of the Service Provider.
A signed App/VNF/CNF package is onboarded to the O-Cloud images repository containing the App/VNF/CNF package, certificate(s) and signature(s) (signed hash value) of the App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.
During instantiation to the O-Cloud Platform from the trust O-Cloud images repository, the App/VNF/CNF package is authenticated and verified using signatures from both App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.
Algorithms, key sizes and standards to be used for signature generation/verification must follow the "O-RAN Security Protocol Specification" section 5.1.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-2: Sensitive artifacts Encryption/Decryption for confidentiality protection
The confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts is ensured by either asymmetric or symmetric Encryption/Decryption:
Confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts during their delivery to the Service Provider
Asymmetric based on public/private key pair
App/VNF/CNF Provider encrypts the sensitive artifacts with the Service Provider public keys
Service Provider decrypts the sensitive artifacts using the private key(s)
Symmetric based on a shared key between App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider that is used to encrypt or decrypt sensitive artifacts
App/VNF/CNF Provider encrypts sensitive artifacts with the shared common key
Service Provider decrypts sensitive artifacts with the same shared common key
Confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts during onboarding and instantiation
During onboarding to the trust O-Cloud images repository, NFO encrypts the App/VNF/CNF sensitive artifacts using the appropriate encryption key(s) provided by Service Provider.
Prior to instantiation of the App/VNF/CNF package, the stored App/VNF/CNF sensitive artifacts shall be decrypted. After Service Provider App/VNF/CNF decryption, any signature is verified. The cryptographic key material used for decryption of the App/VNF/CNF Package is provided by the Service Provider.
Algorithms, key sizes and standards to be used for Encryption/Decryption must follow the "O-RAN Security Protocol Specification" section 5.1.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-3: App/VNF/CNF packages should be compliant with ETSI NFV specifications, ETSI GS NFV-SOL004 [42], ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [43] and ETSI GS NFV-SEC 021 [41] for package formats and signing/verification procedures.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-4: Hardware devices such as HSMs, TPMs should be used to secure certificates and keys used by the cryptographic operations (e.g., Signature generation/verification, Encryption/Decryption, Hashing) for image protection.
Software Package Protection at the O-Cloud Infrastructure Layer
The identified requirements and controls in this section are enforcing the protection of O-Cloud software packages at the infrastructure level layer, e.g., AAL drivers, IMS, DMS, Host OS, Hypervisor/Container Engine.

O1 Interface
O1 Interface connecting the SMO to the Near-RT RIC, one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs.
Requirements
All O1 functions in an O-RAN deployment may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. In order to support the zero trust principles guiding O-RAN security requirements, the O1 interface will enforce confidentiality, integrity, authenticity through an encrypted transport, and least privilege access control using the network configuration access control model.
Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these functions without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. Unrestricted read operations can reveal sensitive information to unauthorized users. For operators to manage O-RAN functions using NETCONF [9] effectively and securely, they need a standards-based mechanism for role-based access control that integrates with NETCONF. The network configuration access control model (NACM) [10] provides the means to restrict access for users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.
NACM further enables operators need to integrate both authentication and authorization with a centralized access management platform, protect the running configuration from unauthorized modification and deletion, support change management procedures for updating both network function configurations and changes to the NACM instance on a network function.
This chapter specifies the requirements for O1 NACM support post function initialization and when the function is operating normally. NACM requirements related to network function initialization and when repairing broken access control configuration will be addressed in a future release of the document.

Open Fronthaul Interface
C-plane
Introduction
The O-DU sends UL C-plane messages and DL C-plane messages to O-RU to trigger transmission and reception of RF signals. The DL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive DL I/Q data in U-plane messages from O-DU. Likewise, the UL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive RF signal and send UL I/Q data in U-plane messages to O-DU. Any delay of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard U-plane traffic from O-DU and the UE [31].
An adversary can inject its own DL C-plane or UL C-plane messages by spoofing the associated O-DU. As a result, it would block the O-RU from processing the corresponding U-Plane packets received from the O-DU and O-RU respectively, leading to temporary DoS and, limited cell performance on cells served by the O-RU [4]
Requirements
[REQ-SEC-OFCP-1] The C-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange C-plane messages with O-RUs.
Security Controls
Authentication and Authorization of network elements supporting the C-Plane
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-1 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of an O-DU and other network elements supporting the C-Plane within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.
U-plane
Requirements
Open Fronthaul U-plane transports 5G System Control Plane and User Plane messages between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.  The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [32] provides confidentiality and integrity protection of 5G System Control Plane and User Plane between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.
Security Controls
S-plane
Introduction
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks within a PTP network. Within a PTP domain [27], the grandmaster clock is the source of time to which all other PTP clocks in the domain are synchronized.
The IEEE 1588 standard specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the best clock from PTP Network and Local PTP Clock. The BMCA runs on PTP instances in the network continuously and is adjusting to changes in that network. PTP ANNOUNCE messages are used to build a timing distribution hierarchy with grandmaster at the top. There can be many grandmasters in PTP Network, but PTP Domain can have only one. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for providing timing to the PTP slave nodes.
Following the selection of the new grandmaster, the grandmaster begins transmitting the current time within the SYNC message and FOLLOW_UP messages if applicable. This allows the other clocks to synchronize their time to the grandmaster.
S-Plane attacks include an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization. Details are covered in Clause 5.4.1.2 of [4].
The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:
O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.
O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RU’s at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).
Requirements
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-1] The S-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.
NOTE: This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane where authenticated and authorized PTP nodes communicate over the Open Fronthaul network.
NOTE: There is no specific requirement for authentication and authorization mechanism of S-plane PTP messages.
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-2] The S-Plane should provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-3] For the O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model the S-Plane should protect against MITM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [28].
Security Controls
Synchronization Architecture Redundancy
This clause addresses requirement REQ-SEC-OFSP-3 by providing an architectural recommendation to S-plane security based on redundancy in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into to the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-1: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support simultaneous Grandmasters.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-2: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.
O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [30] Clause 8.2.3 Timing/Synchronization Redundancy & Resiliency provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
Authentication and Authorization of PTP nodes
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFSP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFSP-2 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

Security Controls
Open Fronthaul Point-to-Point LAN Segment
The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. These are also known as point-to-point LAN segments [12]. Each end of the Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segment comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, e.g., O-DU, O-RU, etc., as described in [13] and [14].
An Open Fronthaul network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Xhaul Transport Network Elements that share a point-to-point LAN segment with Open Fronthaul network elements are also Open Fronthaul network elements. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, TNE and PRTC-T/GM [13][14][15][26].
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-1: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to authenticate and authorize point-to-point LAN segments between Open Fronthaul network elements.
REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-2: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to detect and report when an authorized point-to-point LAN segment is made or broken.
REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-3: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to block access to unused Ethernet ports in an Open Fronthaul network element.
Open Fronthaul implementations may support IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] to satisfy the requirements listed above. Implementations that support optional 802.1X shall provide the security controls as specified in sections 5.2.5.5.2 and 5.2.5.5.3.
Solution #1: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1x Port based Network Access Control
IEEE 802.1X-2020 is optional to support.
NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.
IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network.
Port-based network access control in the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprises supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12]  and as further described in this section. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification and are determined by vendor implementation in agreement with operator-specific requirements.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-1: Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.
Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-2: Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 supplicant functionality [12] for each port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.
Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network
In IEEE 802.1X-2020 a supplicant mutually authenticates with an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-3: Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-4: An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based network access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-5: Port-based network access control between a supplicant and authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall use EAP TLS authentication as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
Authenticator interface to an Authentication Server in the Open Fronthaul Network
IEEE 802.1x describes an EAP-TLS exchange which includes an interface between an authenticator and authentication server. [12]
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-7: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server shall support IETF RADIUS standards, IETF RFC 2865[22], IETF RFC 2866[23], IETF RFC 3579[24], and successor standards.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-8: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server should support IETF Diameter standards, IETF RFC 4072 [25] and successor standards.
NOTE: Mechanisms to secure the interface between the authenticator and authentication server are out of scope of the O-RAN Alliance.
O-DU as an Authenticator
Configuration LLS-C1 [13] and Cascade Mode in the Shared Cell Concept [12] are cases where an O-DU and O-RU are Open Fronthaul network elements in a point-to-point LAN segment.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-6: In the case of Configuration LLS-C1, the O-DU must support the authenticator functionality as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
Authentication and authorization procedure for 802.1x Port based Network Access Control
IEEE 802.1X-2020 is optional to support.
NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.
General requirements
Only those Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant that have mutually authenticated with an authenticator are authorized to participate in the Open Fronthaul network. If an authenticator port is to be activated in the Open Fronthaul, then the authenticator initially places the port into an unauthorized state that allows EAP over LAN (EAPOL) packets for EAP authentication and blocks all other traffic. If the mutual authentication has been successful and the operator authorizes operation for the network element port, then the port is switched to the authorized state whereby non-EAPOL packets can be sent and received.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-9: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator shall place each of its unauthorized ports into a state that allows EAPOL traffic and block all other Ethernet traffic.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-10: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator should be able to implement authorization policies that apply to its authorized ports. Authorization policies may include tagging authorized traffic with a particular VLAN-ID as it egresses the Open Fronthaul network element and/or enforcing access control policies that restrict the type of traffic able to be forwarded by the Open Fronthaul network element.
Manufacturer Install Certificates
IEEE 802.1X [12] defines encapsulation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Using such an approach, a supplicant implements an EAP method according to its supported credentials. Prior to a supplicant enrolling in an operator’s PKI, a manufacturer installed certificate shall be used together with an EAP-TLS dialogue to enable certificate-based mutual authentication to be performed between an authenticator and a supplicant.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-11: The O-RU shall have installed a Manufacturer Installed X.509 Certificate.
Security Procedure
The following procedure describes the authentication and authorization, based on IEEE 802.1 Port based Network Access Control, of point-to-point LAN segments between a supplicant and another Open Fronthaul network element acting as an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-12: The normal operation procedure shown in Figure 5-2 shall be performed to authenticate and authorize an O-RU within an Open Fronthaul network.
FFS: Identify end-to-end signalling flow for other Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant.
FFS: other operation procedures, to include, but not limited to, procedures to take into account existing operator provided certificates and for upgrading an O-RU to support IEEE 802.1X.

Each O-RAN component serves important network function(s) based on a list of its necessary network protocols and services supported through its network interface(s). Proper, transparent, and secure network protocols and services enabled on each O-RAN component is essential for its overall security posture with the reduced risk.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-NET-1: A list of network protocols and services supported on the O-RAN component shall be clearly documented by its vendor. Unused protocols shall be disabled.
Robustness of Common Transport Protocols
IP, UDP, TCP, SCTP, SSH, HTTP and HTTP2 are the common transport protocols widely used by any O-RAN components for network communications and services. Robust implementation of those common transport protocols can significantly improve the security of each O-RAN component and system overall.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-TRAN-1: Common transport protocols (IP, UDP, TCP, SCTP, SSH, HTTP and HTTP2) used in O-RAN system should be able to handle unexpected inputs (not in-line with protocol specification) without functional compromise. The unexpected inputs include random mutations of the protocol headers and payloads, as well as targeted fuzzing with state awareness.
Robustness against Volumetric DDoS Attack
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most common security risks for any O-RAN component with external facing network interface(s). DDoS attack often results in service interruption and even worse system crash and prolonged network outage. A volumetric DDoS attack can come from a bad actor or adversary, or a misconfiguration by the operator.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-DOS-1: An O-RAN component with external network interface shall be able to withstand network transport protocol based volumetric DDoS attack without system crash and returning to normal service level after the attack
Robustness of OS and Applications
The robustness of the O-RAN component in the OS and application(s) installed is fundamental to the overall security posture of the O-RAN system.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-SYS-1: Known vulnerabilities in the OS and applications of an O-RAN component shall be clearly identified and documented by its vendor
Password-Based Authentication
Weak, stolen, and re-used passwords are some of the common and leading causes of data breaches and tried-and-true ways of gaining access to systems, services, and applications. Password configuration(s) for both remote password based and Web UI login interfaces on O-RAN components shall be examined to valid secure password policies are supported and enforced.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-PASS-1: If password is used as an authentication attribute, O-RAN component vendors shall follow security best practices to mitigate risks resulting from different password-based authentication attacks such as brute-forcing, unauthorized password resets, man-in-the-middle, and dictionary attacks.
SBOM Guidelines for O-RAN
SBOM Overview
This section provides guidance for generation, delivery, and use of a software bill of materials (SBOM).
SBOM is a fundamental component of a mature Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SBOM is an industry best practice part of secure software development that enhances the understanding of the upstream software supply chain so that vulnerability notifications and updates can be properly and safely handled across the installed customer base.   The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) define SBOM as “a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.” The SBOM documents proprietary and third-party software, including commercial and free and open-source software (FOSS), used in software products.  The SBOM is maintained and used by the software supplier and stored and viewed by the network operator.
Summary of U.S. DoC and NTIA Report
The DoC, in coordination with NTIA, published a report “The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)” [17] that provides guidance on the data fields, automation, and processes to be used by suppliers and customers. Some key points are provided below:
SBOM Data Fields
The SBOM must contain as minimum fields: Supplier Name, Component Name, Version of the Component, Other Unique Identifiers, Dependency Relationship, Author of the SBOM data, and Timestamp.
SBOM Automation
The interoperable data formats used to generate and consume SBOMs must be either Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [18], CycloneDX [19], or Software Identification (SWID) [20] tags.
SBOM Practices
DoC advises that the cryptographic hash and digital signature of the SBOM may be defined in the contractual agreement between the software supplier and customer.
DoC advises the terms for access control to the SBOM may be defined in the contractual agreement between the software supplier and customer.
Depth is the level of upstream suppliers maintained in the SBOM.  DoC advises an SBOM should contain all primary (top level) components, with all their transitive dependencies listed. At a minimum, all top-level dependencies must be listed with enough detail to seek out the transitive dependencies recursively.
The commercial software supplier is not obligated to make the SBOM publicly available.
SBOM Requirements for O-RAN
The SBOM delivery should be made under contractual agreement with specific terms that include the following items:
REQ-SBOM-001: The O-RAN vendor should provide the SBOM with every O-RAN software delivery, including patches, to the network operator.
REQ-SBOM-002: The minimum set of data fields must be according to NTIA guidance.  Additional fields may be required on a contractual basis.
REQ-SBOM-003: Vulnerabilities must not be included as an additional data field because it would represent a static view from a specific point in time, while vulnerabilities are constantly evolving.
NOTE: The SBOM should be used by vendors and operators to periodically check against known vulnerability databases to identify potential risk.
NOTE: The level of risk for a vulnerability should be determined by the software vendor and operator with consideration of the software product, use case, and network environment.
NOTE: The SBOM provides transparency into the use of open-source software having known vulnerabilities or contributions from individuals or companies in adversarial nations, but it does not protect against zero-day vulnerabilities that were unintentionally or maliciously inserted, exploited, or discovered and not reported.
REQ-SBOM-004: SBOM Depth must be provided at top-level.
REQ-SBOM-005: SBOM depth must be provided to a second-level for O-RAN Software Community (OSC) sourced software to indicate which OSC modules are used and which individual and/or company contributed the software for that module.
REQ-SBOM-006: SBOM depth should be provided to second-level for any used open source software.
REQ-SBOM-007: A hash must be generated for the SBOM.
REQ-SBOM-008: A digital signature must be provided for the SBOM.
REQ-SBOM-009: Access control to the SBOM must be established on a need-to-know basis to limit security risk and protection of intellectual property.  Access controls should be agreed upon between the vendor and operator and contractually specified.
REQ-SBOM-010: The SBOM must be encrypted in transfer and storage.
NOTE: As stated in the DoC/NTIA report, “…some have raised concerns that adversaries could take advantage and target those critical components for novel attacks. Further research is necessary to understand the optimal structure and incentives for sharing, protecting, and using SBOM data."
REQ-SBOM-011: The SBOM must be provided in Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [17], CycloneDX [18], or Software Identification (SWID) [19] format.
NOTE: ISO/IEC 5962:2021 - Information technology — SPDX® Specification V2.2.1, published August 2021, specifies SPDX as the standard data format for communicating the component and metadata information associated with SBOM.

Guidance on Security Requirements
Controls given in this section are designed as a guidance and non-normative. The implementation of those non-normative controls depends on the security policies within the App/VNF/CNF provider and Service Provider.
Potential controls on REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-1 and REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-4
App/VNF/CNF packages need to be frequently tested throughout the lifecycle of the App/VNF/CNF:
Tools used for static code and dynamic security analysis, analysis of code being released, and penetration test results must be shared with the Service Provider.
