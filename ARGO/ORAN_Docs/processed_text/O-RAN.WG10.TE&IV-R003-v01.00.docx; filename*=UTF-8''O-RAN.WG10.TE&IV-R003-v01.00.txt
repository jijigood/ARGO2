4	Use Case Description

4.1	Analysis of Existing O-RAN Use Cases

4.1.1 Use case 1: O-RAN network provisioning

4.1.1.1    Background and goal of the use case

The O-RAN Provisioning use case in WG10 OAM Architecture Specification [i.2] describes the sequence of steps to deploy and provision O-RAN NFs on physical/virtualized resources by leveraging the SMO Framework and O-Cloud management entities.

The goal of this use case is to highlight the role of Topology Exposure (TE) and Inventory Management (IV) services during provisioning of O-RAN NFs.  This use case leverages the OAM flows of O-RAN provisioning use case and highlights the interactions of O-RAN entities with TE & IV service producer. These interactions are for CRUD operations on inventory objects corresponding to the newly deployed NFs.

4.1.1.2		Entities/resource involved in the use case

The SMO Framework leverages TE &IV services within the SMO. TE&IV services maintain the state of O-RAN NFs in the inventory, which will be used by SMO to derive the contextual information of the network.  TE&IV services support CRUD operations on inventory objects and interactions with OAM functions.

4.2 New Topology and Inventory Use Cases

4.2.1   Use case 1: Topology based alarm correlation

This use case provides the background , motivation , and requirements for Topology based alarm correlation , allowing operators to resolve or handle the alarms triggered through O1, O2 and M-Plane interface(in case of hybrid O-RU) using Topology Exposure and Inventory Management services, thereby reducing effort for root cause analysis of alarms.

4.2.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

Faults are inevitable in big distributed system like O-RAN. Unhandled alarms will degrade the performance of the O-RAN network and will impact the users. It is important to quickly find the relationship between different alarms. Faults in O1 nodes are reported through O1 interface, faults in O-Cloud resources are reported through O2 interface and faults in the O-RU are reported through M-Plane interface. With disaggregated nature of O-RAN architecture, it becomes difficult to determine the relationship between alarms raised in O1 node or O-Cloud or O-RU. Topology and Inventory models with capability to show relationship between RAN resources , O-Cloud resources and transport resources is required to pinpoint the relationship between alarming resources.

 Scenario: Internal network switch failure in O-Cloud may impact NF Deployments which might affect the O-RAN network. Different alarms will be raised over O2, O1 and M-Plane interface as result of cascading effect of failure of an internal network switch in O-Cloud.

Topology based alarm correlation shall query the TE&IV service producer to understand the relationships between the topology/inventory resources and the alarmed resources.

The objective of this use case is to leverage TE&IV services for alarm correlation in order to determine the root cause of a problem

4.2.1.2	Entities/resource involved in the use case

TE&IV service consumer (e.g., : an rAPP)

Queries TE&IV service producer to get the relationship between alarmed resources

TE&IV service producer

Exposes TE&IV services based on Topology and Inventory Models and APIs, which offers among others the capability to provide the relationship between resources provided by O1 nodes, O-Cloud and O-RU

Consumes the data provided by the SMO functions (e.g., O1-related data, O2-related data, DME, SME, etc) and exposes it via the Topology and Inventory Models and APIs

4.2.2   Use case 2: O-RAN Network Planning

4.2.2.1 Background and goal of the use case

Network Planning enables CSPs to design, manage and optimize networks efficiently. Network planning and network design aim at ensuring that the new telecommunications network operates at optimum cost and has sufficient capacity and reliability to meet the needs of the subscriber and operator. With the advent of cloud native technologies and the ability to iterate and deploy quickly through containers, microservices etc., the time period between network planning and design to network deployment and realization has reduced significantly compared to the traditional process.

Inventory supports the network planning process by storing and providing information regarding planned networks. TE &IV services enable bulk upload of network data to inventory, which eases planning and deployment of large scale networks

The objective of this use case is to illustrate the use of bulk upload services offered by TE&IV service producer during O-RAN network planning and deployment.

NOTE: File format for bulk upload of inventory data is dependant on the common topology and inventory model and is not covered in this specification

4.2.2.2 Entities/resource involved in the use case

Service Management and Orchestration Framework - Supports the deployment of PNFs

OAM Functions -. Manages provisioning of NFs and state of inventory objects

NFO - Interacts with O-Cloud to perform life cycle management of NFs

TE&IV service producer  - Enables bulk upload of data in the inventory

O-Cloud - Interacts with SMO for deployment of NFs

Goal

Illustrate the role of TE & IV services in O-RAN network planning and deployment

Actors and Roles

Service Management and Orchestration Framework: TE & IV service producer, OAM Functions

Radio and Transport network designers

Radio and Transport network planners

Field Technician

Network Operator

Assumptions

The Service Management and Orchestration Framework and O-Cloud are connected and interact normally

Pre-conditions

Planning data for RAN, transport networks etc. are available in files in pre-defined format

Planning data has information about NF hierarchy, geo-location, O-Cloud Id for NF deployment etc.

O-DU and O-RU are PNFs

PNFs are constructed/installed

Transport network is installed

O-Cloud supports platform and resource management normally

NF Software Package has been uploaded to the O-Cloud

O1 interface is configured between NFs and the SMO

Begins when

Radio and Transport network planners decide to create planned network in a specific geo-location based on finalized design from network designers

Step 1 (M)

Radio planner uses TE&IV services to upload RAN planning data

Step 2 (M)

TE&IV service producer creates RAN objects and associations in the planned inventory as per uploaded data

Step 3 (M)

TE&IV service producer notifies the successful creation of RAN objects to radio planner

Step 4 (M)

Transport network planner leverages TE&IV services to upload transport planning data

NOTE: Only those transport parameters required to configure O-RAN end points constitute transport planning data.

Step 5 (M)

TE&IV service producer creates transport objects in the planned inventory as per uploaded data

Step 6 (M)

TE&IV service producer notifies the successful creation of transport objects to transport planner

Step 7 (M)

The SMO queries O-Cloud (based on the O-Cloud Id in planning data) for available O-Cloud capacity to deploy NFs (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP)

Step 8 (M)

O-Cloud provides the requested information.

Step 9 (M)

The SMO interacts with O-Cloud for deployment of O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP NFs  as per section 2.2.1, O-RAN Service Provisioning use case in [i.2]

Step 10 (M)

The deployed NFs in O-Cloud notify the SMO about successful instantiation

Step 11(M)

The SMO uses TE&IV services to transition the state of NF inventory objects to "active"

Step 12 (M)

Field technician powers on the PNFs (O-DUs and O-RUs).

Step 13 (M)

The PNFs send registration to the SMO

Step 14.1 (M)

The SMO triggers provisioning of NFs using planned configuration data ; The SMO configures the NFs as per section 2.2.1, O-RAN Service Provisioning use case in [i.2]

Step 14.2 (M)

The SMO triggers provisioning of PNFs as per section 2.2.1, O-RAN Service Provisioning use case in [i.2]

Step 15 (M)

The SMO uses TE&IV services to transition the state of PNF inventory objects to "active"

Ends when

The SMO holds up-to-date, active inventory of O-RAN NFs.

Exceptions

None

Post Condition

O-RAN network has been established and provides service to customers
