Introduction
Current M-Plane specification mandates role-based access control with local user management. This implies that the Netconf Controller must keep track of locally defined users in each managed O-RU. It also means that some default behavior must be applied during installation of an O-RU, eg default users pre-defined by vendor for SSH and first trusted user connecting over TLS is given “sudo” role.

Background
Netconf Access Control
Netconf access control is defined in the WG4 M-Plane Specification [2] to be used in the O-RU, but only with local user management configuration in each O-RU.
Netconf access control is also used on the O1 interface. The SFG Security Requirements Specification [1] defines, for O1 entities, that (REQ-NAC-FUN-9): Netconf endpoints SHALL support external user to group mapping via at least one of the following protocols: LDAP with StartTLS [11], OAuth 2.0, RADIUS with EAP, and TACACS/TACACS+.
Software and Configuration Server (SCS)
The 3GPP TS 28.314 [3] and TS 28.315 [4] describes the SCS as an entity and how it can be used in a Plug and Connect use case to provide initial configuration to a Network Element. The O-RU can be seen as a Network Element that during the provisioning needs to get configuration and find an O-RU controller.
The 3GPP TS 28.316 [5] describes how a Network Element can get the address to an SCS from a DHCP server.
The WG4 M-Plane Specification [2] Chapter on “Start-up installation” currently does not include the use of an SCS.
Key Issues
This clause details the key issues identified for security aspects related to user management in the O-RU.
Key Issue #1: Default account in O-RU
Key issue detail
Current M-plane specification requires a vendor specific default account. Default accounts should be avoided if possible.
The 3GPP TS 33.117 section 4.2.3.4.2.2 states that predefined accounts shall be deleted or disabled. “Should this measure not be possible the accounts shall be locked for remote login“.
Security threats
An attacker can log on to the O-RU in these cases: The vendor defined default account (username/password) is leaked.
Any entity that is connecting using an accepted certificate using
any operator-signed certificate verified by an installed trust anchor or
any certificate if the enrollment failed and the O-RU supports the optional feature of using its pre-installed vendor-signed certificate for setting up mTLS connections to its O-RU Controller(s) ( see [2], clause 6.2.6.3), as in this case the O-RU does not have an installed trust anchor.
An attacker can use a successful log-on to connect to the O-RU before the connection to the O-RU controller is established. New accounts can be created.
If the default account is not being disabled, it can be used to connect and modify existing configuration.
Potential security requirements
To mitigate the threat of an attacker using a default account to create additional accounts, the O-RU controller can verify that no unwanted accounts exist. An alternative is to avoid using a default account and rely on centralized user management during provisioning.
Key Issue #2: Default account get sudo role
Key issue detail
Current M-plane specification requires that when first connection is made, the first (i.e. default) user get sudo role by default. Default accounts should be avoided if possible.
Security threats
The security threats identified with first connected user getting sudo role:
An Attacker can connect using
any operator-signed certificate verified by an installed trust anchor or
any certificate if the enrollment failed and the O-RU supports the optional feature of using its pre-installed vendor-signed certificate for setting up mTLS connections to its O-RU Controller(s) ( see [2], clause 6.2.6.3), as in this case the O-RU does not have an installed trust anchor or
a leaked default username/password
will get “sudo” role. This can be used to connect to the O-RU before the connection to the O-RU controller is established. New accounts can be created.
If the default account is not disabled, it can also be used after the connection to the O-RU controller is established to connect and modify existing configuration.
Potential security requirements
To mitigate the threat of an attacker using a default account to create additional accounts, the O-RU controller can verify that no unwanted accounts exist. An alternative is to avoid using a default account and rely on centralized user management during provisioning.
Key Issue #3: The O-RU controller must keep track of locally defined users in each managed O-RU
Key issue detail
Current M-plane specification defines role-based access control configured in each O-RU. Allowing for centralized user management would simplify management.
Security threats
The security threats identified with only local user management in O-RU, configured by the O-RU controller:
If the same user configuration is used in all O-RUs, any O-RU controller can connect to any O-RU. Changes will have to be performed on every O-RU.
Potential security requirements
To simplify management a centralized user management system can be used.
Key Issue #4: How to get initial configuration to Central Server?
Key issue detail
When the O-RU is started for the first time, it will not have any operator specific configuration on how to connect to the central server. To use centralized user management this configuration is required.
Security threats
The security threats identified with the O-RU not having any operator specific configuration to use centralized user management:
If the O-RU does not know the address to the Central AA server (eg LDAP) it will revert to the use of locally defined users, ie issue 1-3
Potential security requirements
The O-RU can get this data from one of the entities that it connects to during provisioning, ie DHCP, DNS and RA/CA, or from a new entity, eg SCS.
Key Issue #5: How does the O-RU connect securely to the Central Server?
Key issue detail
The O-RU must have options to connect securely to the central server.
Security threats
The security threats identified with O-RU not having a secure connection to the centralized user management server:
Without a secure connection, the Central AA server (eg LDAP) can be fake
Without a secure connection, the transferred response from the central AA server can be tampered with
Potential security requirements
The connection to the centralized cerver should be authenticated and should be confidentiality and integrity protected.
Key Issue #6: Availability of the centralized user management server for the O-RUs
Key issue detail
The centralized user management server should be available at all times. Hence the need to cover the below aspects
Overloading of centralized server
Number of RUs connected to the server
Frequency of making Authentication and Authorization calls
Number of users that are centralised managed for the O-RU
Network connectivity
Connectivity loss between the O-RU and centralized server
SW/HW failure of centralized server
The centralized server might be unavailable due to a software or HW failure and hence needs to be highly available
Security threats
Slow response of the centralized server due to overloading
Unavailability of the centralized server due to overloading
No response due to network disconnection
No response due to SW/HW failure of the centralized server
Potential security requirements
Load model to be defined to ensure no overloading of the centralized server
Consistent connectivity between the O-RU and the centralized server
Highly availability of the centralized server
In case the connectivity to the central server is not available, local users to be activated and used until the connectivity is resolved
Key Issue #7: Categorisation of users that need to centrally and locally managed
Key issue detail
The purpose of centralized user management is to have effective administration and accountability of O-RU users. It is recommended that the users of the O-RU are being categorized into central and local users to ensure that centrally administered users are kept at a maximum and local users are at a minimum with a well defined need.
Security threats
O-RU user information could be mismanaged, classifying users managed centralized as local users, defeating the purpose of central authentication, authorization and administration.
Potential security requirements
Categorisation of central and local users for the O-RU
Disable all local user management to maximise the usage of central users
In case of priority first check if the user exists in central server, if no user found then check locally
Key Issue #8: Fetching initial security configuration data from a Software and Configuration Server
Key issue detail
The SCS is a server that can provide initial configuration data to an O-RU before first connection to an O-RU Controller similar to what is described in 3GPP TS 28.314 and TS 28.315. The O-RU can then get the address to the SCS from the DHCP server.
The initial configuration data can be security related data such as the address to a central AA server, trusted certificates etc.
Security threats
The security threats identified with O-RU fetching initial configuration from SCS:
Without a secure connection, the SCS can be fake.
Without a secure connection, the configuration data can be tampered with in transit or at rest in SCS storage.
Without trust information, eg a trusted certificate, the O-RU cannot verify that the SCS is ok. This is however the same risk as the O-RU has with the O-RU Controller in current specification.
Without first performing certificate enrollment to get a certificate issued by an Operator PKI system, the O-RU can optionally use a factory installed Vendor certificate to connect securely to the SCS.
Potential security requirements
The connection to the SCS server that can provide initial configuration data to an O-RU should be authenticated and should be confidentiality and integrity protected.
Key Issue #9: Secure transport to the centralized authentication server
Key issue detail
Data in transit can be intercepted between the O-RU and the central server. From this perspective, there should be options of secure transport for the reason that credentials will be shared for authentication and authorization purposes which should not be compromised. There is a possibility to also have a compromised central server
Security threats
Security related credentials required for authentication and authorization purpose between the O-RU and the central server could be compromised. (REF[1] T-O-RAN-08)
Threats to compromised central server
Potential security requirements
To protect against malicious activity on the transport between the O-RU and central server, the service interface should provide for
Confidentiality: protect the data transferred against eavesdropping
Integrity: protect the data transferred against malicious change
Authenticity: mutually authenticate both endpoints (O-RU and central server)
As an option, secure and efficient standard protocols could be considered from the below to guard against the above threats
LDAPs
OpenID and OAuth
/RADIUS due to the presence of Netconf/Yang on the O-RUs
Key Issue #10: Secure storage of O-RU credentials
Key issue detail
Improper or missing controls for protection of security credentials at rest, generated by O-RAN components, may not allow a correct and rapid audit in case of a security incident occurrence. Security restoration is delayed. Missing availability and integrity of security credentials could conduct to delays, wrong results, delays in security restoration and threat persistence ([1] §5.4.1.1). A secure mechanism of storing the credentials of the O-RU in the central server should be required. The credentials of the O-RU could be
Username and password
Certificates
Tokens
Security threats
O-RU related credentials could be compromised by an attacker if the storage is not secure. The important aspect is that as all the data is stored centrally and the entire network could be potentially sabotaged if not secured.
REF: ([1] T-O-RAN-06).
Potential security requirements
Secure mechanism of storing various types of credentials of the O-RU
Management of username and password centrally possibly with salting mechanisms and a one-way hash
Certificates could be centralized managed with respect to users encompassing the life cycle management of enrollment, renewal and revocation.
Tokens to be centralized created an OAuth server and encrypted during motion and refreshing actions
Mitigations and Solutions
Key Issue Analysis
The 10 identified Key Issues can be grouped into these groups, Local User Management issues, Initial Provisioning, and Central Server Issues.
The Local User Management Issues can be mitigated by using a Centralized User Management Service, however that means that the other two groups of issues come into play.
The Key Issues with Initial Provisioning of data needed to securely connect to the central AA server can be mitigated by the services proposed for distributing Trust Anchors, i.e. Voucher based protocols, BRSKI based or SCS based solutions. It is concluded that DHCP, DNS and RA/CA methods would either not be secure or have the same Initial Provisioning issues.
The Key Issues related to the Central AA server can be mitigated by placing security requirements on the Central AA server itself. This is however not a component designed by the O-RAN Alliance specifications so only recommendations can be made to the operators.
Solution #1: Centralized User Management
To mitigate the listed Key Issues related to Local User Management it is proposed to allow the use of centralized user management services. There are many to choose from and the investigation done on this topic before setting requirements on O1, showed that it was not possible to agree on one single protocol. It is proposed to allow the same protocols on the O-RU as on the O1 entities.
Proposed requirement:
REQ-x The O-RU MAY support external user to group mapping with the role based access control concept.
Proposed security control:
REQ-y An O-RU that supports external user to group mapping SHALL support one or more of the following protocols; LDAP with StartTLS, OAuth 2.0, RADIUS with EAP, and TACACS/TACACS+.
REQ-z The centralized server may   be an external 3rd party system or within the ORAN reside within a SMO or O-DU (depending on hierarchical or hybrid mode).
REQ-zz The centralized server stores the necessary credentials for the O-RU in a secure manner with access control (mapping to KI10)
REQ-zx An O-RU that supports external user to group mapping may support SAML and OIDC.
Solution 2#: Initial Provisioning
To mitigate the listed Key Issues related to Initial Provisioning of data needed to securely connect to the central AA server it is possible to use the already defined security control [Security Requirements Specification]:
SEC-CTL-TAP-5: An O-RAN PNF may support 3GPP SCS [66], [67], [68] for download of initial security configuration.
Solution #3 High Availability
To mitigate the listed Key Issues related to the use of a Central AA Server it is proposed to recommend operators to plan the deployment with high availability.
Proposed requirement:
REQ-y An O-RU supports minimal local users so that they can be activated during possible disconnection from the centralised user management server.
