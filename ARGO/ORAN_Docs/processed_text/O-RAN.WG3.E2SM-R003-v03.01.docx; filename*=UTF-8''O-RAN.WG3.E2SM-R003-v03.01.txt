4	General

4.1	Procedure Specification Principles

The procedure specification principles defined in E2AP [3] clause 4 shall apply.

4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3	Specification Notations

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.

Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".

5	E2SM services

As defined in E2 General Aspects and Principles [2], a given RAN Function offers a set of services to be exposed over the E2 (REPORT, INSERT, CONTROL, POLICY and/or QUERY) using E2AP [3] defined procedures.  Each of the E2AP Procedures listed in table 5-1 contains specific E2 Node RAN Function dependent Information Elements (IEs).

6	Common Elements for E2SM Service Models

6.1	General

Sub clause 6.2 presents the individual information elements that may be adopted by any specific E2SM including the specifications listed in table 5-1. Sub clause 6.3 provides the corresponding ASN.1 definition of each information element, this module may be associated with the ASN.1 definitions in a specific E2SM specification using the ASN.1 "Import" instruction.

The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the messages and information elements:

NOTE:	The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in 3GPP TR 25.921 [13].

6.2	Information Element definitions

6.2.1	General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);

-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

6.3	Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)

6.3.1	General

E2SM ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [16] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [17].

Sub clause 6.3.2 presents the Abstract Syntax of the common E2SM information elements that may be used with RAN Function specific E2AP [3] Information Elements when encoded using ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 6.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
