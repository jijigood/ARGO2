Security Controls

API Security – Authentication

REST APIs and gRPC APIs are being considered as valid network solutions for Near-RT RIC APIs. REST APIs use HTTP and support Transport Layer Security (TLS). REST APIs utilizes JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as encoding protocol. gRPC APIs use HTTP/2 and support as well TLS. In contrast with REST APIs, gRPC use Protobuf as encoding protocol.

Time critical E2 related APIs are currently specified to run over SCTP/Protobuf network protocol stack. The security network layer specified for E2 interface is IPsec (see SEC-CTL-E2).

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-1: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC) shall support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication via X.509v3 certificates. Client authentication, as specified in rfc 5246 (TLS 1.2) and rfc8446 (TLS 1.3), shall be used. Both the client (e.g., xApp as API consumer) and the server (e.g., Near-RT RIC platform as API producer) require a certificate, and both sides authenticate each other using their public/private key pair.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-2: Time critical APIs (e.g., E2 related APIs), not supported by TLS protocol, shall support IPsec with IKEv2 certificated-based authentication according to O-RAN security protocol specification [3].

API Security – Authorization

Authorization is the function of specifying and enforcing access rights or privileges to certain resources or services. In the actual context of Near-RT RIC, the platform as API producer shall be responsible to specify those rights/privileges for the platform services as resources to the xApps as consumers. As a guideline, an xApp should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more.

Authorization mechanisms shall be enforced by the Near-RT RIC platform in the following key API procedures [33]:

Discovery of Near-RT RIC APIs: The Near-RT RIC platform shall provide means to restrict xApps from discovery of some published APIs based on configuration policies.

E2 Subscription API procedure: The subscription management shall be based on operator’s policies. An xApp may be restricted to interface with only a subset of E2 Nodes by such policies. This procedure establishes a set of preconditions that assume authorization proccesses:

xApp has been authorized to issue E2 Subscription API requests

xApp has been authorized to request guidance from Conflict mitigation

xApp Subscription Management has been configured to permit E2 Subscription API requests only from specific list of xApps.

E2 Control API procedure: Only authorized xApps may initiate RIC control request messages issued by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Nodes, for a specific scope (e.g, E2 Node list, RAN function, etc.).

E2 Guidance API procedure: The purpose of this procedure only authorized xApp to obtain guidance from the conflict mitigation platform function prior to initiating an action.

SDL API procedures: The precondition to consume the services exposed by SDL API (e.g, client registration, fetch data, notification, store, etc.) is that xApps have been successfully registered and authorized.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-3: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC)  in Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 authorization framework as specified in in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.

The roles defined in OAuth 2.0 are assigned as follows:

Resource owner / Resource server (producer): Near-RT RIC platform modules providing services via APIs

Client (consumer): xApp

Grants shall be of the type Client Credentials Grant, as described in clause 4.4. of RFC 6749. Client authentication as specified in rfc 5246 (TLS 1.2) and rfc8446 (TLS1.3) shall be used.

SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-4: For A1-P, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7, for service requests received from a Non-RT RIC.

SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-5: For A1-EI, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 client, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.

API Security – Confidentiality and Integrity

SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-6: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC) shall support TLS to provide message confidentiality and integrity.

SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-7: Time critical APIs (e.g., E2 related APIs), not supported by TLS protocol, shall support IPsec to provide message confidentiality and integrity.

The Table 1 provides a summary of the security controls (SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-1 to -7) and a mapping of those to the related interface/API transport protocols considered in Near-RT RIC platform..

Software Package Protection at the O-Cloud Network Functions and Applications Layer

The identified requirements and controls in this section are enforcing the protection of O-Cloud App/VNF/CNF packages at the application layer, i.e., xApp, rApp, O-CU, O-DU, Near RT RIC.

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-1: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be certified by the App/VNF/CNF Provider using industry recognized software testing suites (e.g., vulnerability scanning, static and dynamic testing, penetration testing) to find any flaws and defects within the package and to eliminate them before its delivery to the Service Provider. Test results shall be shared with the Service Provider.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-2: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be signed by the App/VNF/CNF Provider prior to its delivery to the Service Provider for ensuring its authenticity and integrity.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-3: The App/VNF/CNF package shall include minimally the following artifacts according to [41], [42]: the App/VNF/CNF software image, the signing certificate, and signature(s) of App/VNF/CNF Provider.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-4: If the App/VNF/CNF package refers to external artifacts [41], [42], those artifacts shall be signed by the App/VNF/CNF Provider.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-5: The Service Provider shall verify the signatures on all external artifacts.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-6: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be validated by NFO upon its reception using the signature generated and provided by the App/VNF/CNF Provider.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-7: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be tested by the Service Provider for known security vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerability scanning). All discovered vulnerabilities must be reported and remediated where possible.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-8: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be cryptographically bound to one Telco Operator before its on-boarding to the O-Cloud images repository. This will prevent unauthorized package to be instantiated even if it has valid App/VNF/CNF certificate [41], [44], [45].

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-9: App/VNF/CNF packages shall be successfully authenticated and verified during instantiation to the O-Cloud Platform from the trust O-Cloud images repository using signatures from both App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-10: Signatures reaching the end of their lifetime shall be renewed before the certificate times out (signatures provided by the App/VNF/CNF Provider might be ignored if the signature of the Service Provider is valid). App/VNF/CNF packages during instantiation that do not include valid certificates shall be removed from the O-Cloud images repository and from any type of O-Cloud Platform memory.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-11: App/VNF/CNF packages stored within the O-Cloud images repository shall be protected in terms of integrity and confidentiality.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-12: App/VNF/CNF packages stored within the O-Cloud images repository shall be accessible to only authorized actors (e.g., authorized users and authorized systems) and over networks that enforce authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-13: O-Cloud images repository shall be clear of vulnerable App/VNF/CNF packages and of packages with expired or missing certificates.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-14: Sensitive information (e.g L1 Apps/VNFs/CNFs, keys, PII, passwords or other critical configuration data) that is needed during the lifecycle of the App/VNFs/CNFs shall be protected in terms of confidentiality at rest and in transit [46], [47], [48].

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-15: NFO shall contain a pre-installed root certificate of trusted CA (trusted by the Telco Operator) before the on-boarding of the App/VNF/CNF package for verifying its authenticity and integrity. Root certificate shall be delivered via a trusted channel separately from an App/VNF/CNF package [42].

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-16: App/VNF/CNF Packages shall contain a Change Log. Change log captures the changes from one version to another including but not limited to features added/removed, issues fixed as well as known issues not resolved [43].

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-17: O-Cloud Platform shall monitor stored App/VNF/CNF Packages downloaded from the O-Cloud images repository within SMO to the O-Cloud platform to determine if any unauthorized modification, deletion, or insertion has occurred.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-18: SMO and O-Cloud Platform shall support a strong protection of keys and algorithms for the code signing and encryption/decryption processes.

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-1: App/VNF/CNF package shall be signed and verified for integrity and authenticity protection.

To provide the authenticity and integrity protection for the App/VNF/CNF package, one of the two following options should be followed according to [41], [42]:

Option 1: The App/VNF/CNF package contains a Digest (a.k.a. hash) for each of the artifacts of the App/VNF/CNF package. The table of hashes is signed with the App/VNF/CNF provider private key.

Option 2: The complete App/VNF/CNF package is signed with the App/VNF/CNF provider private key.

The signature verification process comprises the following steps:

Responsible: App/VNF/CNF Provider, Service Provider

A signed App/VNF/CNF package is delivered to the Service Provider containing the App/VNF/CNF package, the signing X.509v3 certificate, and the signature (signed hash value) of App/VNF/CNF Provider.

The root CA certificate must be pre-installed within the NFO for the validation of the App/VNF/CNF Provider signing certificate.

Upon reception of the signed App/VNF/CNF package from App/VNF/CNF Provider by the Service Provider:

New hash(es) of the received App/VNF/CNF package are calculated and verified by the Service Provider against the hash(es) in the signature using the App/VNF/CNF Provider certificate retrieved from the received App/VNF/CNF package.

Verification is successful if both hash values match.

Service Provider signs the verified App/VNF/CNF package prior to its onboarding to the trust O-Cloud images repository

Service Provider computes the hash value of the App/VNF/CNF package and the signature of the App/VNF/CNF Provider.

The hash value is signed with the private key(s) of the Service Provider.

A signed App/VNF/CNF package is onboarded to the O-Cloud images repository containing the App/VNF/CNF package, certificate(s) and signature(s) (signed hash value) of the App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.

During instantiation to the O-Cloud Platform from the trust O-Cloud images repository, the App/VNF/CNF package is authenticated and verified using signatures from both App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.

Algorithms, key sizes and standards to be used for signature generation/verification must follow the "O-RAN Security Protocol Specification" clause5.1.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-2: Sensitive artifacts shall be encrypted for confidentiality protection

The confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts is ensured by either asymmetric or symmetric Encryption/Decryption:

Confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts during their delivery to the Service Provider

Asymmetric based on public/private key pair

App/VNF/CNF Provider encrypts the sensitive artifacts with the Service Provider public keys

Service Provider decrypts the sensitive artifacts using the private key(s)

Symmetric based on a shared key between App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider that is used to encrypt or decrypt sensitive artifacts

App/VNF/CNF Provider encrypts sensitive artifacts with the shared common key

Service Provider decrypts sensitive artifacts with the same shared common key

Confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts during onboarding and instantiation

During onboarding to the trust O-Cloud images repository, NFO encrypts the App/VNF/CNF sensitive artifacts using the appropriate encryption key(s) provided by Service Provider.

Prior to instantiation of the App/VNF/CNF package, the stored App/VNF/CNF sensitive artifacts shall be decrypted. After Service Provider App/VNF/CNF decryption, any signature is verified. The cryptographic key material used for decryption of the App/VNF/CNF Package is provided by the Service Provider.

Algorithms, key sizes and standards to be used for Encryption/Decryption must follow the "O-RAN Security Protocol Specification" clause 5.1.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-3: App/VNF/CNF packages should be compliant with ETSI NFV specifications, ETSI GS NFV-SOL004 [42], ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [43] and ETSI GS NFV-SEC 021 [41] for package formats and signing/verification procedures.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-4: Encryption shall be used to secure  cryptographic keys used by the cryptographic operations (e.g., Signature generation/verification, Encryption/Decryption, Hashing) for  App/VNF/CNF image protection.

See Annex C for the guidance to implement these controls.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SS-2 The O-Cloud platform shall delete cryptographic keys and sensitive data using a secure deletion method from both active and backup storage medias.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SS-3 The O-Cloud platform shall ensure that any data contained in a resource is not available when the resource is de-allocated from one VM/Container and reallocated to a different VM/Container. This requirement requires protection for any data contained in a resource that has been logically deleted or released but may still be present within the resource which in turn may be re-allocated to another VM/Container.

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-1 Encryption shall be used for all stored cryptographic keys and sensitive data (credentials, tokens, configuration data, etc.) with appropriate authentication and access control mechanisms.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-2 Secure deletion of data shall be used on addressable memory locations that are no longer in use due to reallocation, by overwriting with specific binary patterns, including zeroes, ones, and a random bit pattern [53].

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-COT-2 It shall be possible to attest an O-RAN App/VNF/CNF through the full attestation chain from the hardware layer through the virtualization layer to the O-RAN App/VNF/CNF layer [44], [51].

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1 A true chain of trust shall start from the hardware firmware through the virtualization layer to O-RAN Apps/VNFs/CNFs to prevent tampering during the system boot and integrity check on the O-Cloud software layers [50], [52]. The chain of trust should be built from measurements stored in a hardware root of trust using the measure-and-verify security model, with each component measuring, verifying, and launching the next level [52]. Within the hardware root of trust are stored cryptographic keys and measurements (i.e., hash values) of the O-Cloud’s firmware, software, and configuration data.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2 A remote attestation service (AS) should be supported for providing additional benefits beside verifying O-Cloud platform integrity by CoT. The remote AS should collect O-Cloud platform configurations and integrity measurements from data center servers at a O-Cloud service provider via a trust agent service running on the O-Cloud platform servers [58]. The O-Cloud service provider is responsible for defining allowlisted trust policies. These policies should include information and expected measurements for desired platform CoT technologies. The collected data is compared and verified against the policies, and a report is generated to record the relevant trust information in the AS database [58].The remote AS should be extended to include O-RAN Apps/VNFs/CNFs integrity.

See Annex C for the guidance to implement these controls.

AAL

There are two different scenarios of deployment of the hardware accelerator manager:

Scenario 1: the hardware accelerator manager is a SW component part of the O-Cloud platform and outside the hardware accelerator device. It is linked to the hardware accelerator device via a vendor specific interface.

Scenario 2: The hardware accelerator manager is part of the hardware accelerator device. In this scenario, the vendor specific interface does not exist.

For both scenarios, AALI-C-Mgmt interface is the same between the hardware accelerator manager and the O-Cloud IMS/DMS.

AAL components are parts of the O-Cloud platform, therefore the O-Cloud security requirements and controls on image protection, secure update, isolation, secure storage and chain of trust apply (see clause 5.1.8).

O1 Interface

O1 Interface connecting the SMO to the Near-RT RIC, one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs.

Requirements

All O1 functions in an O-RAN deployment may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. In order to support the zero trust principles guiding O-RAN security requirements, the O1 interface will enforce confidentiality, integrity, authenticity through an encrypted transport, and least privilege access control using the network configuration access control model.

Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these functions without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. Unrestricted read operations can reveal sensitive information to unauthorized users. For operators to manage O-RAN functions using NETCONF [9] effectively and securely, they need a standards-based mechanism for role-based access control that integrates with NETCONF. The network configuration access control model (NACM) [10] provides the means to restrict access for users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

NACM further enables operators need to integrate both authentication and authorization with a centralized access management platform, protect the running configuration from unauthorized modification and deletion, support change management procedures for updating both network function configurations and changes to the NACM instance on a network function.

This chapter specifies the requirements for O1 NACM support post function initialization and when the function is operating normally. NACM requirements related to network function initialization and when repairing broken access control configuration will be addressed in a future release of the document.

Open Fronthaul Interface

C-plane

Introduction

The O-DU sends UL C-plane messages and DL C-plane messages to O-RU to trigger transmission and reception of RF signals. The DL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive DL I/Q data in U-plane messages from O-DU. Likewise, the UL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive RF signal and send UL I/Q data in U-plane messages to O-DU. Any delay of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard U-plane traffic from O-DU and the UE [31].

An adversary can inject its own DL C-plane or UL C-plane messages by spoofing the associated O-DU. As a result, it would block the O-RU from processing the corresponding U-Plane packets received from the O-DU and O-RU respectively, leading to temporary DoS and, limited cell performance on cells served by the O-RU [4]

Requirements

[REQ-SEC-OFCP-1] The C-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange C-plane messages with O-RUs.

Security Controls

Authentication and Authorization of network elements supporting the C-Plane

This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-1 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.

Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of an O-DU and other network elements supporting the C-Plane within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

U-plane

Requirements

Open Fronthaul U-plane transports 5G System Control Plane and User Plane messages between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.  The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [32] provides confidentiality and integrity protection of 5G System Control Plane and User Plane between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.

Security Controls

S-plane

Introduction

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks within a PTP network. Within a PTP domain [27], the grandmaster clock is the source of time to which all other PTP clocks in the domain are synchronized.

The IEEE 1588 standard specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the best clock from PTP Network and Local PTP Clock. The BMCA runs on PTP instances in the network continuously and is adjusting to changes in that network. PTP ANNOUNCE messages are used to build a timing distribution hierarchy with grandmaster at the top. There can be many grandmasters in PTP Network, but PTP Domain can have only one. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for providing timing to the PTP slave nodes.

Following the selection of the new grandmaster, the grandmaster begins transmitting the current time within the SYNC message and FOLLOW_UP messages if applicable. This allows the other clocks to synchronize their time to the grandmaster.

S-Plane attacks include an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization. Details are covered in Clause 5.4.1.2 of [4].

The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:

O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.

O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RU’s at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).

Requirements

[REQ-SEC-OFSP-1] The S-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.

NOTE: This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane where authenticated and authorized PTP nodes communicate over the Open Fronthaul network.

NOTE: There is no specific requirement for authentication and authorization mechanism of S-plane PTP messages.

[REQ-SEC-OFSP-2] The S-Plane should provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.

[REQ-SEC-OFSP-3] For the O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model the S-Plane should protect against MITM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [28].

Security Controls

Synchronization Architecture Redundancy

This clause addresses requirement REQ-SEC-OFSP-3 by providing an architectural recommendation to S-plane security based on redundancy in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.

The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into to the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.

SEC-CTL-OFSP-1: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support simultaneous Grandmasters.

SEC-CTL-OFSP-2: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.

O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [30] Clause 8.2.3 Timing/Synchronization Redundancy & Resiliency provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.

Authentication and Authorization of PTP nodes

This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFSP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFSP-2 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.

Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

Security Controls

Open Fronthaul Point-to-Point LAN Segment

The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. These are also known as point-to-point LAN segments [12]. Each end of the Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segment comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, e.g., O-DU, O-RU, etc., as described in [13] and [14].

An Open Fronthaul network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Xhaul Transport Network Elements that share a point-to-point LAN segment with Open Fronthaul network elements are also Open Fronthaul network elements. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, TNE and PRTC-T/GM [13][14][15][26].

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-1: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to authenticate and authorize point-to-point LAN segments between Open Fronthaul network elements.

REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-2: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to detect and report when an authorized point-to-point LAN segment is made or broken.

REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-3: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to block access to unused Ethernet ports in an Open Fronthaul network element.

Open Fronthaul implementations may support IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] to satisfy the requirements listed above. Implementations that support optional 802.1X shall provide the security controls as specified in sections 5.2.5.5.2 and 5.2.5.5.3.

Solution #1: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1x Port based Network Access Control

IEEE 802.1X-2020 is optional to support.

NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.

IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network. Port-based network access control in the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprises supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12]  and as further described in this section. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification and are determined by vendor implementation in agreement with operator-specific requirements..SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-1: Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.

Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-2: Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 supplicant functionality [12] for each port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.

Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network

In IEEE 802.1X-2020 a supplicant mutually authenticates with an authenticator.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-3: Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-4: An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based network access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-5: Port-based network access control between a supplicant and authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall use EAP TLS authentication as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].

Authenticator interface to an Authentication Server in the Open Fronthaul Network

IEEE 802.1x describes an EAP-TLS exchange which includes an interface between an authenticator and authentication server. [12]

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-7: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server shall support IETF RADIUS standards, IETF RFC 2865[22], IETF RFC 2866[23], IETF RFC 3579[24], and successor standards.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-8: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server should support IETF Diameter standards, IETF RFC 4072 [25] and successor standards.

NOTE: Mechanisms to secure the interface between the authenticator and authentication server are out of scope of the O-RAN Alliance.

O-DU as an Authenticator

Configuration LLS-C1 [13] and Cascade Mode in the Shared Cell Concept [12] are cases where an O-DU and O-RU are Open Fronthaul network elements in a point-to-point LAN segment.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-6: In the case of Configuration LLS-C1, the O-DU must support the authenticator functionality as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].

Authentication and authorization procedure for 802.1x Port based Network Access Control

IEEE 802.1X-2020 is optional to support.

NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.

General requirements

Only those Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant that have mutually authenticated with an authenticator are authorized to participate in the Open Fronthaul network. If an authenticator port is to be activated in the Open Fronthaul, then the authenticator initially places the port into an unauthorized state that allows EAP over LAN (EAPOL) packets for EAP authentication and blocks all other traffic. If the mutual authentication has been successful and the operator authorizes operation for the network element port, then the port is switched to the authorized state whereby non-EAPOL packets can be sent and received.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-9: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator shall place each of its unauthorized ports into a state that allows EAPOL traffic and block all other Ethernet traffic.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-10: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator should be able to implement authorization policies that apply to its authorized ports. Authorization policies may include tagging authorized traffic with a particular VLAN-ID as it egresses the Open Fronthaul network element and/or enforcing access control policies that restrict the type of traffic able to be forwarded by the Open Fronthaul network element.

Manufacturer Install Certificates

IEEE 802.1X [12] defines encapsulation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Using such an approach, a supplicant implements an EAP method according to its supported credentials. Prior to a supplicant enrolling in an operator’s PKI, a manufacturer installed certificate shall be used together with an EAP-TLS dialogue to enable certificate-based mutual authentication to be performed between an authenticator and a supplicant.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-11: The O-RU shall have installed a Manufacturer Installed X.509 Certificate.

Security Procedure

The following procedure describes the authentication and authorization, based on IEEE 802.1 Port based Network Access Control, of point-to-point LAN segments between a supplicant and another Open Fronthaul network element acting as an authenticator.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-12: The normal operation procedure shown in Figure 52 shall be performed to authenticate and authorize an O-RU within an Open Fronthaul network.

FFS: Identify end-to-end signalling flow for other Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant.

FFS: other operation procedures, to include, but not limited to, procedures to take into account existing operator provided certificates and for upgrading an O-RU to support IEEE 802.1X.

SBOM Guidelines for O-RAN

SBOM Overview

This section provides guidance for generation, delivery, and use of a software bill of materials (SBOM).

SBOM is a fundamental component of a mature Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SBOM is an industry best practice part of secure software development that enhances the understanding of the upstream software supply chain so that vulnerability notifications and updates can be properly and safely handled across the installed customer base.   The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) define SBOM as “a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.” The SBOM documents proprietary and third-party software, including commercial and free and open-source software (FOSS), used in software products.  The SBOM is maintained and used by the software supplier and stored and viewed by the network operator.

Summary of U.S. DoC and NTIA Report

The DoC, in coordination with NTIA, published a report “The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)” [17] that provides guidance on the data fields, automation, and processes to be used by suppliers and customers. Some key points are provided below:

SBOM Data Fields

The SBOM must contain as minimum fields: Supplier Name, Component Name, Version of the Component, Other Unique Identifiers, Dependency Relationship, Author of the SBOM data, and Timestamp.

SBOM Automation

The interoperable data formats used to generate and consume SBOMs must be either Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [18], CycloneDX [19], or Software Identification (SWID) [20] tags.

SBOM Practices

DoC advises that the cryptographic hash and digital signature of the SBOM may be defined in the contractual agreement between the software supplier and customer.

DoC advises the terms for access control to the SBOM may be defined in the contractual agreement between the software supplier and customer.

Depth is the level of upstream suppliers maintained in the SBOM.  DoC advises an SBOM should contain all primary (top level) components, with all their transitive dependencies listed. At a minimum, all top-level dependencies must be listed with enough detail to seek out the transitive dependencies recursively.

The commercial software supplier is not obligated to make the SBOM publicly available.

SBOM Requirements for O-RAN

The SBOM delivery should be made under contractual agreement with specific terms that include the following  requirements and controls.

Requirements

REQ-SBOM-001: The O-RAN vendor shall provide the SBOM with every O-RAN software delivery package, including patches.

REQ-SBOM-002: The minimum set of data fields shall  include: Supplier Name, Component Name, Version of the Component, Other Unique Identifiers as available, Dependency Relationship, Author of the SBOM data, and Timestamp [17].

REQ-SBOM-003: Vulnerabilities shall not be included as an additional data field because it would represent a static view from a specific point in time, while vulnerabilities are constantly evolving.

NOTE: The SBOM should be used by vendors and operators to periodically check against known vulnerability databases to identify potential risk.

NOTE: The level of risk for a vulnerability should be determined by the software vendor and operator with consideration of the software product, use case, and network environment.

NOTE: The SBOM provides visibility into the use of open-source and third-party provided software having known vulnerabilities or contributions from individuals or companies in adversarial nations, but it does not protect against zero-day vulnerabilities that were unintentionally or maliciously inserted, exploited, or discovered and not reported.

REQ-SBOM-004: SBOM Depth shall be provided at top-level.

REQ-SBOM-005: SBOM depth shall be provided to a second-level for O-RAN Software Community (OSC) sourced software to indicate which OSC modules are used and which individual and/or company contributed the software for that module.

REQ-SBOM-006: SBOM depth shall be provided to second-level for any used open source software.

REQ-SBOM-007: SBOM shall be authenticity and integrity protected when in transit and at rest.

REQ-SBOM-008:  Commercial software vendors using software from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) shall provide an SBOM that includes the components used from the OSC.

REQ-SBOM-009:  SBOM for commercial software shall be access controlled.

REQ-SBOM-010:  The consumer of an SBOM shall maintain confidentiality protection on the SBOM delivered from the SBOM producer.

NOTE: As stated in the DoC/NTIA report [17], “…some have raised concerns that adversaries could take advantage and target those critical components for novel attacks. Further research is necessary to understand the optimal structure and incentives for sharing, protecting, and using SBOM data."

REQ-SBOM-011: The SBOM shall be provided in Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [18], CycloneDX [19], or Software Identification (SWID) [20] format.

NOTE: ISO/IEC 5962:2021[21] - Information technology — SPDX® Specification V2.2.1, published August 2021, specifies SPDX as a standard data format for communicating the component and metadata information associated with SBOM.

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-SBOM-001: For integrity, a hash shall be generated for the SBOM, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specification [3], clause 5.

SEC-CTL-SBOM-002: For authenticity, a digital signature shall be provided for the SBOM, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specification [3], clause 5.

TS 33.511 §4.2.2.1.12

#18

Key refresh at the gNB

Key refresh shall be possible for KgNB, KRRC-enc, KRRC-int, KUP-int, and KUP-enc and shall be initiated by the gNB when a PDCP COUNTs are about to be re-used with the same Radio Bearer identity and with the same KgNB.
The network is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g. use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key, or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED transition." as specified in TS 38.331 [6], clause 5.3.1.2.

TS 33.511 §4.2.2.1.18

#21

Unauthorized Viewing

When the system is not under maintenance, there shall be no system function that reveals confidential system internal data in the clear to users and administrators. Such functions could be, for example, local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging messages, alarms, configuration file exports etc. Confidential system internal data contains authentication data (i.e. PINs, cryptographic keys, passwords, cookies) as well as system internal data that is not required for systems administration and could be of advantage to attackers (i.e. stack traces in error messages).

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.2.2
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.2.2

#22

Protecting data and information in storage

For sensitive data in (persistent or temporary) storage read access rights shall be restricted. Files of a system that are needed for the functionality shall be protected against manipulation.
In addition, the following rules apply for:
- Systems that need access to identification and authentication data in the clear, e.g. in order to perform an authentication. Such systems shall not store this data in the clear, but scramble or encrypt it by implementation-specific means.
- Systems that do not need access to sensitive data (e.g. user passwords) in the clear. Such systems shall hash this sensitive data.
- Stored files on the network product: examples for protection against manipulation are the use of checksum or cryptographic methods.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.2.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.2.3

#23

Protecting data and information in transfer

Usage of cryptographically protected network protocols is required.
The transmission of data with a need of protection shall use industry standard network protocols with sufficient security measures and industry accepted algorithms. In particular, a protocol version without known vulnerabilities or a secure alternative shall be used.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.2.4
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.2.4

#24

System handling during overload situations

The system shall provide security measures to deal with overload situations which may occur as a result of a denial of service attack or during periods of increased traffic, or reach the congestion threshold. In particular, partial or complete impairment of system availability shall be avoided. Potential protective measures include:
- Restricting available RAM per application.
- Restricting maximum sessions for a Web application.
- Defining the maximum size of a dataset.
- Restricting CPU resources per process.
- Prioritizing processes.
- Overload control method, e.g. limiting amount or size of transactions of a user or from an IP address in a specific time range.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.1

#25

Boot from intended memory devices only

The network product can boot only from the memory devices intended for this purpose.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.2

#26

System handling during excessive overload situations

The system shall act in a predictable way if an overload situation cannot be prevented. A system shall be built in this way that it can react on an overload situation in a controlled way. However, it is possible that a situation happens where the security measures are no longer sufficient.
In such case it shall be ensured that the system cannot reach an undefined and thus potentially insecure state. In an extreme case this means that a controlled system shutdown is preferable to uncontrolled failure of the security functions and thus loss of system protection.
The vendor shall provide a technical description of the network product's Over Load Control mechanisms (especially whether these mechanisms rely on cooperation of other network elements e.g. eNode B) and the accompanying test case for this requirement will check that the description provides sufficient detail in order for an evaluator to understand how the mechanism is designed.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.3

#27

System robustness against unexpected input

During transmission of data to a system it is necessary to validate input to the network product before processing. This includes all data which is sent to the system. Examples of this are user input, values in arrays and content in protocols. The following typical implementation error shall be avoided:
- No validation on the lengths of transferred data
- Incorrect assumptions about data formats
- No validation that received data complies with the specification
- Insufficient handling of protocol errors in received data
- Insufficient restriction on recursion when parsing complex data formats
- White listing or escaping for inputs outside the values margin

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.4

#28

Network product Software integrity validation

1) Software package integrity shall be validated in the installation/upgrade stage.
2) Network product shall support software package integrity validation via cryptographic means, e.g. digital signature. To this end, the network product has a list of public keys or certificates of authorised software sources, and uses the keys to verify that the software update is originated from only these sources.
3) Tampered software shall not be executed or installed if integrity check fails.
4) A security mechanism is required to guarantee that only authorized individuals can initiate and deploy a software update, and modify the list mentioned in bullet 2.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.5

#29

System functions shall not be used or accessed without successful authentication and authorization

The usage of a system function without successful authentication on basis of the user identity and at least one authentication attribute (e.g. password, certificate) shall be prevented. System functions comprise, for example network services (like SSH, SFTP, Web services), local access via a management console, local usage of operating system and applications. This requirement shall also be applied to accounts that are only used for communication between systems. An exception to the authentication and authorization requirement are functions for public use such as those for a Web server on the Internet, via which information is made available to the public.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.1.1

#30

The network product shall use accounts that allow unambiguous identification of the user

Users shall be identified unambiguously by the network product. The network product shall support assignment of individual accounts per user, where a user could be a person, or, for Machine Accounts, an application, or a system. The network product shall not enable the use of group accounts or group credentials, or sharing of the same account between several users, by default. The network product shall support a minimum number of 50 individual accounts per user data base if not explicitly specified in a SCAS of a particular network product, so that accountability for each user is ensured even in large operator networks. The network product shall not support user access credentials unrelated to an account.
NOTE: The network product may support independent user data bases for different access methods, e.g. one data base for command shell access on OS level and another data base for GUI access. User data bases may be stored locally on the network product or on a central AAA system that the network product accesses for user authentication.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.1.2

#31

Account protection by at least one authentication attribute

The various user and machine accounts on a system shall be protected from misuse. To this end, an authentication attribute is typically used, which, when combined with the user name, enables unambiguous authentication and identification of the authorized user.
Authentication attributes include:
- Cryptographic keys
- Token
- Passwords
This means that authentication based on a parameter that can be spoofed (e.g. phone numbers, public IP addresses or VPN membership) is not permitted. Exceptions are attributes that cannot be faked or spoofed by an attacker.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.4.1
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.2.1

#32

Predefined accounts shall be deleted or disabled

All predefined or default accounts shall be deleted or disabled. Many systems have default accounts (e.g. guest, ctxsys), some of which are preconfigured with or without known passwords. These standard users shall be deleted or disabled. Should this measure not be possible the accounts shall be locked for remote login. In any case disabled or locked accounts shall be configured with a complex password as specified in clause 4.2.3.4.3.1 Password Structure of TS 33.117. This is necessary to prevent unauthorized use of such an account in case of misconfiguration.
Exceptions to this requirement to delete or disable accounts are accounts that are used only internally on the system involved and that are required for one or more applications on the system to function. Also, for these accounts remote access or local login shall be forbidden to prevent abusive use by users of the system.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.4.1
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.2.2

#33

Predefined or default authentication attributes shall be deleted or disabled

Normally, authentication attributes such as password or cryptographic keys will be preconfigured from producer, vendor or developer of a system. Such authentication attributes shall be changed by automatically forcing a user to change it on 1st time login to the system or the vendor provides instructions on how to manually change it.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.4.1
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.2.3

#34

Password Complexity rule

The setting by the vendor shall be such that a network product shall only accept passwords that comply with the following complexity criteria:
1) Absolute minimum length of 8 characters (shorter lengths shall be rejected by the network product). It shall not be possible setting this absolute minimum length to a lower value by configuration.
2) Comprising at least three of the following categories:
- at least 1 uppercase character (A-Z)
- at least 1 lowercase character (a-z)
- at least 1 digit (0-9)
- at least 1 special character (e.g. @;!$.)
The network product shall use a default minimum length of 10 characters. The minimum length of characters in the passwords shall be configurable by the operator. The default minimum length is the value configured by the vendor before any operator-specific configuration has been applied. The special characters may be categorized in sets according to their Unicode category.
The network product shall at least support passwords of a length of 64 characters or a length greater than 64 characters.
If a central system is used for user authentication, password policy is performed on the central system and additional assurance shall be provided that the central system enforces the same password complexity rules as laid down for the local system in this subclause. If a central system is not used for user authentication, the assurance on password complexity rules shall be performed on the Network Product.
When a user is changing a password or entering a new password, the system checks and ensures that it meets the password requirements. Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level, etc.).

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.1

#35

Password changes

If a password is used as an authentication attribute, then the system shall offer a function that enables a user to change his password at any time. When an external centralized system for user authentication is used it is possible to redirect or implement this function on this system.
Password change shall be enforced after initial login.
The system shall enforce password change based on password management policy. In particular, the system shall enforce password expiry.
Previously used passwords shall not be allowed up to a certain number (Password History).
The number of disallowed previously used passwords shall be:
- Configurable;
- Greater than 0;
- And its default value shall be 3. This means that the network product shall store at least the three previously set passwords. The maximum number of passwords that the network product can store for each user is up to the manufacturer.
When a password is about to expire a password expiry notification shall be provided to the user.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level, etc.). An exception to this requirement is machine accounts.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.2

#36

Protection against brute force and dictionary attacks

If a password is used as an authentication attribute, a protection against brute force and dictionary attacks that hinder password guessing shall be implemented.
Brute force and dictionary attacks aim to use automated guessing to ascertain passwords for user and machine accounts. Various measures or a combination of these measures can be taken to prevent this.
The most commonly used protection measures are:
1) Using the timer delay (this delay could be the same or increased depending the operator's policy for each attempt, e.g. double the delay, or 5 minutes delay, or 10 minutes delay) for each newly entered password input following an incorrect entry ("tar pit").
2) Blocking an account following a specified number of incorrect attempts, refer to 4.2.3.4.5 of TS 33.117. However, it has to be taken into account that this solution needs a process for unlocking and an attacker can force this to deactivate accounts and make them unusable.
3) Using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attempts (often used for Web applications).
4) Using a password blacklist to prevent vulnerable passwords.
NOTE: Password management and blacklist configuration may be done in a separate node that is different to the node under test, e.g. a SSO server or any other central credential manager.
In order to achieve higher security, it is often meaningful to combine two or more of the measures named here. It is left to the vendor to select appropriate measures.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level, etc.). An exception to this requirement is machine accounts.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.3

#37

Hiding password display

The password shall not be displayed in such a way that it could be seen and misused by a casual local observer. Typically, the individual characters of the password are replaced by a character such as "*". Under certain circumstances it may be permissible for an individual character to be displayed briefly during input. Such a function is used, for ex ample, on smartphones to make input easier. However, the entire password is never output to the display in plaintext.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level, etc.). An exception to this requirement is machine accounts.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.4

#38

Network Product Management and Maintenance interfaces

#39

Policy regarding consecutive failed login attempts

a) The maximum permissible number of consecutive failed user account login attempts should be configurable by the operator. The definition of the default value set at manufacturing time for maximum number of failed user account login attempts shall be less than or equal to 8, typically 5. After the maximum permissible number of consecutive failed user account login attempts is exceeded by a user there shall be a block delay in allowing the user to attempt login again. This block delay and also the capability to set period of the block delay, e.g. double the delay, or 5 minutes delay, or 10 minutes delay, after each login failure should be configurable by the operator. The default value set at manufacturing time for this delay shall be greater than or equal to 5 sec.
b) If supported, infinite (permanent) locking of an account that has exceeded maximum permissible number of consecutive failed user account login attempts should also be possible via configuration, with the exception of administrative accounts which shall get only temporarily locked.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.5

#40

Authorization policy

The authorizations for accounts and applications shall be reduced to the minimum required for the tasks they have to perform.
Authorizations to a system shall be restricted to a level in which a user can only access data and use functions that he needs in the course of his work. Suitable authorizations shall also be assigned for access to files that are components of the operating system or of applications or that are generated by the same (e.g. configuration and logging files).
Alongside access to data, execution of applications and components shall also take place with rights that are as low as possible. Applications should not be executed with administrator or system rights.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.6.1

#41

Role-based access control

The network product shall support Role Based Access Control (RBAC). A role-based access control system uses a set of controls which determines how users interact with domains and resources. The domains could be Fault Management (FM), Performance Management (PM), System Admin, etc. The RBAC system controls how users or groups of users are allowed access to the various domains and what type of operation they can perform, i.e. the specific operation command or command group (e.g. View, Modify, Execute).
The network product supports RBAC, in particular, for OAM privilege management for network product Management and Maintenance, including authorization of the operation for configuration data and software via the network product console interface.

To protect user sessions the Network Product shall support the following session ID and session cookie requirements:
1. The session ID shall uniquely identify the user and distinguish the session from all other active sessions.
2. The session ID shall be unpredictable.
3. The session ID shall not contain sensitive information in clear text (e.g. account number, social security, etc.).
4. In addition to the Session Idle Timeout (see clause 4.2.3.5.2 Protecting sessions – Inactivity timeout of TS 33.117), the Network Product shall automatically terminate sessions after a configurable maximum lifetime This maximum lifetime defines the maximum session span. When the maximum lifetime expires, the session shall be closed, the session ID shall be deleted and the user shall be forced to (re)authenticate in the web application and to establish a new session. The default value for this maximum lifetime shall be set to 8 hours.
5. Session ID's shall be regenerated for each new session (e.g. each time a user log in).
6. The session ID shall not be reused or renewed in subsequent sessions.
7. The Network Product shall not use persistent cookies to manage sessions but only session cookies. This means that neither the "expire" nor the "max-age" attribute shall be set in the cookies.
8. Where session cookies are used the attribute 'HttpOnly' shall be set to true.
9. Where session cookies are used the 'domain' attribute shall be set to ensure that the cookie can only be sent to the specified domain.
10. Where session cookies are used the 'path' attribute shall be set to ensure that the cookie can only be sent to the specified directory or sub-directory.

1) To filter incoming IP packets on any IP interface at Network Layer .and Transport Layer of the stack ISO/OSI.
2) To allow specified actions to be taken when a filter rule matches. In particular at least the following actions should be supported:
a. Discard/Drop: the matching message is discarded; no subsequent rules are applied and no answer is sent back.
b. Accept: the matching message is accepted.
c. Account: the matching message is accounted for i.e. a counter for the rule is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones. This feature is useful to monitor traffic before its blocking.
3) To enable/disable for each rule the logging for Dropped packets, i.e. details on messages matching the rule for troubleshooting.
4) To filter on the basis of the value(s) of any portion of the protocol header.
5) To reset the accounting.
6) The Network Product shall provide a mechanism to disable/enable each defined rule.

#57

Manipulated packets that are sent to an address of the network device shall not lead to an impairment of availability

A network device shall be not affected in its availability or robustness by incoming packets, from other network element, that are manipulated or differing the norm. This means that appropriate packets shall be detected as invalid and be discarded. The process shall not be affecting the performance of the network device. This robustness shall be just as effective for a great mass of invalid packets as for individual or a small number of packets.
Examples of such packets are:
- Mass-produced TCP packets with a set SYN flag to produce half-open TCP connections (SYN flooding attack).
- Packets with the same IP sender address and IP recipient address (Land attack).
- Mass-produced ICMP packets with the broadcast address of a network as target address (Smurf attack).
- Fragmented IP packets with overlapping offset fields (Teardrop attack).
- ICMP packets that are larger than the maximum permitted size (65,535 Bytes) of IPv4 packets (Ping-of-death attack).
- Uncorrelated reply packets (i.e. packets which cannot be correlated to any request).
Sometimes the relevant behaviour of the network device will be configured. In other cases, the behaviour of the network device may only be verified by the relevant tests.

GTP-U Filtering

The following capability is conditionally required:
- For each message of a GTP-U-based protocol, it shall be possible to check whether the sender of this message is authorized to send a message pertaining to this protocol.
NOTE: The check could be performed e.g. against a whitelist or blacklist of permitted message type / sender identity combinations.
- At least the following actions should be supported when the check is satisfied:
- Discard: the matching message is discarded.
- Accept: the matching message is accepted.
- Account: the matching message is accounted for, i.e. a counter for the rule is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones. This feature is useful to monitor traffic before its blocking.
This requirement is conditional in the following sense: It is required that at least one of the following two statements holds:
- The Network Product supports the capability described above and this is stated in the product documentation.
- The Network Product's product documentation states that the capability is not supported and that the Network Product needs to be deployed together with a separate entity which provides the capability described above.
NOTE : Such a separate entity could e.g. be a GTP Firewall.
NOTE: Test cases for this separate entity are not provided in the present document, but are believed to be similar to them.
NOTE: The test cases are only applicable to all network product classes utilizing GTP-U based protocol.

When a compromised Virtualisation layer tampers the hardware resource configuration which is received from the VIM to result in the configuration error of the hardware, the hardware shall trigger an alert. The administrator can check the alert and find the attack at latter.
NOTE: Whether the virtualisation layer is trust or not is based on operator's decision.

TR 33.818 §5.2.5.7.7.2

#101

Trusted platform

The host system shall implement a Hardware-Based Root of Trust (HBRT) ((e.g. TPM, HSM)) as Initial Root of Trust. The trust state of the platform shall be measured and a trusted chain shall be built.

TR 33.818 §5.2.5.7.7.3

Annex C (informative):
Guidance on Security Requirements & Controls

C.1 O-Cloud

Controls given in this section are designed as a guidance and non-normative. The implementation of those non-normative controls depends on the security policies within the O-Cloud Service Provider, O-RAN  App/VNF/CNF provider and Service Provider.

C.1.1 Software Package Protection at the O-Cloud Network Functions and Applications Layer

Potential controls on REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-1 and REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-4

App/VNF/CNF packages need to be frequently tested throughout the lifecycle of the App/VNF/CNF:

During Development

During on-boarding, within the O-Cloud images repository and during instantiation

During Runtime

Vulnerability scanning

Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Dynamic Application Security testing (DAST)

Penetration testing

Software composition analysis

to be performed frequently for vulnerability scanning or misconfiguration on App/VNF/CNF packages. E.g., Check for malware, secrets stored in package.

Responsible: App/VNF/CNF Provider

Vulnerability scanning

Dynamic Application Security testing (DAST) to be performed for:

Certifying the App/VNF/CNF for functionality as well as authenticity, integrity, and packaging compliance.

Blocking deployments if the package doesn’t comply with the Service Provider security policies

For scanning and detecting potential vulnerabilities

Checking for malware

Scanning for unnecessary system tools and libraries not required by App/VNF/CNF

Software composition analysis

Etc.

Responsible: App/VNF/CNF Provider, Service Provider

Perform continuous scanning/monitoring for known vulnerability or misconfiguration on runtime workloads, check for any open ports, VM/Container escape, etc.

Responsible: Service Provider

Tools used for static code and dynamic security analysis, analysis of code being released, and penetration test results must be shared with the Service Provider.

C.1.2 Secure storage of cryptographic keys and sensitive data

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-1

The following potential implementation options for encrypting cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the O-Cloud platform could be used. The appropriate option to be used depends on the sensitivity of the data to be protected and needs to be assessed/determined by the Service provider.

Software based:

Software-based KMS vaults supporting management of keys, including creation, rotation, and revocation, as well as encrypting and decrypting sensitive data with managed keys [57].

Use a vTPM: A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) is a software-based representation of a physical Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip to provide secure storage of credentials or keys [62]. A vTPM acts as any other virtual device. It performs the same functions as a TPM, but it performs cryptographic coprocessor capabilities in software. It should comply with the TPM 2.0 specification [61].

Hardware based

Hardware-based key vaults: The use of Key Management Service (KMS) based on an HSM [55], [56], [60]. The data is encrypted using a data encryption key (DEK); a new DEK is generated for each encryption. The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) that is stored and managed in the HSM of the KMS provider.

A hardware TPM [59], [61]. For data encryption, an encryption key is stored on disk but encrypted with the TPM master key (the storage root key (SRK)). This encryption key can only be used after it was decrypted by an authenticated TPM. The actual data encryption/decryption is then done by the main CPU, only decryption/encryption of the encryption key is done inside the TPM.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-2

Overwriting with zero (e.g., /dev/zero) or simple patterns.

Overwriting with random data using:

True random data source (e.g., /dev/random). This solution takes too long to wait for the entropy generation.

Pseudorandom data source (e.g., /dev/urandom) can be used as a reasonable source of pseudorandom data.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-3

Each data center adheres to a strict disposal policy and uses the techniques described to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 “Guidelines for Media Sanitization” [53] and DoD 5220.22-M “National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.” [54].

C.1.3 Chain of Trust

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1

There are many ways to measure platform integrity. In many cases, a hardware security module is used to store measurement data such as a HSM and TPM. Various platform integrity technologies build their own CoTs [58] and listed here below:

UEFI Secure Boot (SB)

Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)

Intel Boot Guard

Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR)

Intel Technology Example Summary

AMD Platform Secure Boot (AMD PSB)

Arm TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for Armv8-A

Arm Secure Boot and the Chain of Trust (CoT)

Cisco Platform Roots of Trust

IBM Chain of Trust (CoT)

For more details, see [58], clause 3.2.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2

Please refer to the following technology examples in [58], clause 6.1 for more information:

Intel Security Libraries for the Data Center (ISecL-DC)

Remote AS - Project Veraison (VERificAtIon of atteStatiON)

IBM Platform Attestation Tooling

Relevant information on the AS is provided in [58], clause 6.1 and [44], clause 6.6.

The following figure shows an example of remote AS:

The AS from the hardware layer to the O-RAN App/VNF/CNF includes the following steps (see figure):

Attestation of the O-Cloud platform

RoT measures and verifies hardware resources (server platform) including firmware/BIOS. It then launches the hardware resources.

The server act as the attester of the OS/virtualization layer. It measures, verifies and launches the OS/virtualization layer.

The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by the management platform (e.g. Kubernetes) acting as the trust agent.

Attestation of App/VNF/CNF

The attestation process is initiated by the management platform requesting to instantiate a new App/VNF/CNF:

The virtualization layer verifies the virtual instance.

Virtualized RoT (vRoT) measures the App/VNF/CNF. The vRoT is a virtual instance associated to the hardware protected RoT. The virtualization layer provides this virtual resource to the virtual instance.

Corresponding measurements are reported to the trust agent. The trust agent exposes the attestation results to authorized attestation server (could be within the SMO) so that it verifies collected measurements against trust policies already defined by administrators.
