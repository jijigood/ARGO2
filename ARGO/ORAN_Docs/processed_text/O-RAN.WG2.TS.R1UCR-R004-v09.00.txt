6.1.5	Required data.
For registering, an rApp needs to provide the security credentials along with e.g., rApp name, vendor, software version, certificates etc. and the role an rApp is trying to register (Service Producer and/or Service Consumer).
The response to the rApp registration includes the status of registration i.e., success or failure.
For successful rApp registration, the response will also include the rAppId.
For unsuccessful rApp registration, the response will also include the error code along with relevant information.
The rApp may obtain information about the SME services endpoints from the producer of bootstrap service.
6.2	SME Use case 2: Manage Service Registration

6.2.2	Background and goal of the use case
An rApp as a Service Producer can register each of the new services its produces. Other rApps that are Service Consumers can discover the registered services.
After an rApp as a Service Producer has successfully registered the each of the services it produces, it can update and/or deregister each of the registered services.
6.2.3	Entities/resources involved in the use case.
SME functions in the role of SME services Producer:
support functionality to register a service produced by an rApp,
support authorization of an rApp to determine whether an rApp can register a service, update a registered service, and deregister a registered service,
support validation of the new service produced by an rApp that includes determining whether there are conflicts with services registered earlier,
provide the response of success or failure result to Register service request, Update service registration request and Deregister service request.

11.11.5	Required data
For subscription to notifications regarding changes of registered AI/ML model, the rApp provides the rAppId and the AI/ML model identifier selection criteria. The AI/ML workflow functions send back a subscription identifier in response.
The AI/ML workflow functions send notifications to the subscribing rApp by providing the AI/ML model identifier(s) and available change details of AI/ML model(s).
For unsubscribing from notifications regarding changes of registered AI/ML model, the rApp needs to send the rAppId and AI/ML model subscription identifier.
11.12 	AI/ML workflow-related use case 12: Query of AI/ML Model inference capabilities - AI/ML workflow functions producing AI/ML inference
11.12.1	Overview
This use case enables an rApp to query the inference capability information of an AI/ML model.
11.12.2	Background and goal of the use case
The query AI/ML model inference capabilities procedure are defined as part of the AI/ML workflow services in R1GAP [1]
11.12.3	Entities/resources involved in the use case
AI/ML workflow functions in the role of AI/ML model inference service Producer,
Support functionality allowing rApps to query the inference capability of an AI/ML Model,
rApp in the role of AI/ML model inference service Consumer.
Initiates the procedure to query the inference capability of an AI/ML model.

11.12.5	Required data
For querying of an AI/ML model inference capability information, the AI/ML inference services Consumer needs to provide its rAppId and the query criteria (including the model identifier and model information). The AI/ML workflow functions respond with inference capability information such as model identifier or inference latency.
