3	Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations
3.1	Terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1], O-RAN WG1.OAD [27] and the following apply.
A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1]. and O-RAN WG1.OAD [27]
E2 Node Component ID: Local identifier used to uniquely identify an E2 Node component.
Elementary Procedure: E2AP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An E2AP Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the Near-RT RIC and an E2 Node. An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:
-	Class 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure),
-	Class 2: Elementary Procedures without response.
Global E2 Node ID: Global identifier of an E2 Node.  Defined as the global eNB or gNB identifier and an optional local identifier of an CU-UP or DU which is required when and if an individual DU or CU-UP supports a direct E2 interface.
Global RIC ID: Global identifier of a Near-RT RIC.
RAN Function: A specific Function in a E2 Node; examples include termination of network interfaces (i.e. X2 [8], F1 [12], S1 [13], Xn [11], NGc [10]) and RAN internal functions handling UEs, Cells, etc.
RAN Function ID: Local identifier of a specific RAN Function within an E2 Node that supports one or more RIC Services using a specific E2 Service Model.
RAN Function OID: RAN Function Object Identifier.  Used to identify specific RAN function definition (i.e. E2SM used by specific RAN Function).
RIC Action ID: Local identifier used Near-RT RIC to identify a specific RIC Service Action within a specific RIC Subscription Request, used by E2 Node in subsequent RIC Indication messages.
RIC Call Process ID: Local identifier used by E2 Node to identify the suspended associated procedure instance during an Insert RIC Service Action, used by Near-RT RIC in subsequent RIC Control procedure.
RIC Request ID: Local identifier used to identify a specific RIC Functional procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same protocol peer.  Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same RIC Request ID. The RIC Request ID is determined by the initiating peer of a RIC Functional Procedure.
RIC Service: A Service provided on an E2 Node to provide access to messages and measurements and / or enable control of the E2 Node from the Near-RT RIC.
Transaction ID: Local identifier used to uniquely identify a Global Procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same protocol peer.  Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same Transaction ID. The Transaction ID is determined by the initiating peer of a Global Procedure (Near-RT RIC or E2 Node).
3.2	Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply: None
3.3	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR 21.905 Error! Reference source not found., O-RAN WG1.OAD [27] and the following apply.
An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 Error! Reference source not found. and O-RAN WG1.OAD [27].
EP	Elementary Procedure
4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed.
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed.
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
5	E2AP Services
The present clause describes the services an E2 Node offers to the Near-RT RIC.
5.1	E2AP procedure modules
The E2 interface E2AP procedures are divided into two modules as follows:
1.	RIC Functional Procedures;
2.	Global Procedures;
The  RIC functional procedures module contains procedures used to pass application specific messages between Near-RT RIC applications and a target RAN Function in an E2 node [2].
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not directly related to a specific application.
5.2	Parallel transactions
Parallel transactions, that is, multiple ongoing E2AP procedures related to the same Application and E2 node, are supported.
6	Services expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of E2AP messages. E2AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of E2AP
The functions of E2AP are described in O-RAN Working Group 3 Near-Real-time RAN Intelligent Controller, E2 General Aspects and Principles [2].
8	E2AP Procedures
8.1	Elementary Procedures
In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 EPs.
Table 8.1-1: Class 1 Elementary Procedures
Table 8.1-2: Class 2 Elementary Procedures
8.2	RIC Functional Procedures
8.2.1	RIC Subscription procedure
8.2.1.1	General
This procedure is used to establish RIC Subscriptions on E2 Node consisting of an event trigger and a sequence of RIC Service Actions.
This procedure shall be initiated by the Near-RT RIC.

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: RIC Subscription procedure, successful operation
The Near-RT RIC initiates the procedure by sending a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message which shall contain a unique RIC Request ID IE, assigned by the Near-RT RIC, to the E2 Node.
When the Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message, it shall start the timer TRICEVENTcreate.
At reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message the E2 Node shall:
-	Determine the target RAN Function using the information in the RAN Function ID IE and configure the requested event trigger using information in the RIC Subscription Details IE.
-	If one or more Report, Insert and/or Policy RIC Service Actions are included in the RIC Subscription Details IE then the target RAN Function shall validate the event trigger and requested action sequence and, if accepted, store the required RIC Request ID, RIC Event Trigger Definition IE and sequence of RIC Service Actions.
-	If optional RIC Subscription Start Time IE is present and has expired, then the E2 Node shall ignore the optional RIC Subscription Start Time IE.
If the requested trigger and at least one required RIC Service Action are accepted by the E2 Node, the E2 Node shall reserve for each admitted RIC Service Action the necessary resources and send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message back to the Near-RT RIC.
The E2 Node shall include in the response message the RIC Service Actions for which resources have been prepared at the E2 Node in the RIC Actions Admitted List IE.
The E2 Node shall include the RIC Service Actions that have not been admitted in the RIC Actions Not Admitted List IE with an appropriate cause value.
Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message the Near-RT RIC shall stop timer TRICEVENTcreate and terminate the RIC Subscription procedure.
If more than one RIC Service Actions has been accepted by the E2 Node then, at each occurrence of the common Event Trigger, the sequence of RIC Service Actions shall be executed according to the following considerations:
-	If optional RIC Action Execution Order IE is not present or is present and set to 0 (“Any order”), then the specific RIC Service Action in the sequence of RIC Service Actions may be executed in any order irrespective of the execution order of the other RIC Service Actions.
-	If optional RIC Action Execution Order IE is present and set to a value greater than 0, then the specific RIC Service Action shall be executed in order according to the RIC Action Execution Order IE.
-	If two or more RIC Service Actions have the same value for the optional RIC Action Execution Order IE then these RIC Service Actions shall be executed in parallel.
If the optional RIC Subscription Start Time IE is present, the E2 Node shall only enable the event trigger from the indicated start time.
If the optional RIC Subscription End Time IE is present, the E2 Node shall disable the event trigger when the indicated end time has expired.
Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete Required procedure:
If the optional RIC Subscription End Time IE is present and the indicated end time has expired, the E2 Node may send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUIRED message to the Near-RT RIC with an appropriate cause value.
Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete procedure:
If the optional RIC Subscription End Time IE is present, the Near-RT RIC may initiate an RIC Subscription Delete procedure when the expected RIC Subscription End Time has expired.

If a failure occurs during the RIC Subscription procedure the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.
If the E2 Node admits none of the requested RIC Service Actions, or detects an inconsistency in the sequence of RIC ServiceActions, or in the optional RIC Subsequent Action IE definitions, the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.
If the RIC Subscription procedure contains an invalid optional RIC Subscription Start Time IE and/or RIC Subscription End Time IE, the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.
Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message the Near-RT RIC shall stop the timer TRICEVENTcreate and terminate the RIC Subscription procedure.
Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete procedure:
If there is no response from the E2 Node to the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message before timer TRICEVENTcreate expires in the Near-RT RIC, the Near-RT RIC shall initiate the RIC Subscription Delete procedure containing RIC Request ID IE that was previously assigned by the Near-RT RIC to cancel the RIC Subscription towards the E2 Node. The Near-RT RIC shall ignore any RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE or RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message containing RIC Request ID IE that was previously assigned by the Near-RT RIC received after the initiation of the RIC Subscription Delete procedure and release any resources related to the concerned E2 Node.
8.2.1.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing RIC Subscription Details IE that does not align with the E2 Service Model [3], the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.
If the E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message which contains an unknown RAN Function ID IE, the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.
If the E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing identical contents the E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC containing an appropriate cause value.

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: RIC Indication procedure, successful operation
An E2 Node initiates the procedure by sending RIC INDICATION message to the Near-RT RIC containing the RIC Request ID IE, that was previously assigned by the Near-RT RIC during a successful RIC Subscription procedure.
If the RIC Indication message is in response to an Insert RIC Service Action, then the E2 Node shall provide the RIC Call Process ID IE within the RIC INDICATION message, and the E2 Node shall store current call state, start the associated RIC Time to Wait timer, and suspend further processing of the associated RAN function.
Near-RT RIC may use the RIC Call Process ID IE in a subsequent RIC Control procedure.
If an RIC Subsequent Action IE was associated to the RIC Service Action then, after successful transmission of the RIC INDICATION message, the originating E2 Node shall progress accordingly:
-	If the RIC Subsequent Action Type IE was set to Continue or Halt, and the associated RIC Time to Wait timer has not expired, and a RIC CONTROL REQUEST message is received with the same RIC Call Process ID IE, then the E2 Node shall use the RIC CONTROL REQUEST information along with the stored call state and continue to execute any remaining actions in the sequence of RIC Actions defined in the RIC Subscription procedure prior to resuming normal functionality of the associated RAN function.
-	If the RIC Subsequent Action Type IE was set to Continue and the associated RIC Time to Wait timer has expired, then the E2 Node shall use the stored call state and continue to execute any remaining RIC Service Actions in the sequence of RIC Service Actions defined in the RIC Subscription procedure.
-	If the RIC Subsequent Action Type IE was set to Halt and the associated RIC Time to Wait timer has expired, then the E2 Node shall abort further processing of the associated RAN function.

The Near-RT RIC initiates this procedure by sending the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the E2 node, containing the RIC Request ID IE to uniquely identify the existing RIC Subscription in the E2 node.
When the Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, it shall start timer TRICEVENTmodify.
Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the E2 node shall determine the existing RIC Subscription and the target RAN Function from the RIC Request ID IE and the RAN Function ID IE, respectively.
If the RIC Event Trigger Definition to be Modified IE is included, then the E2 node shall validate and modify the event trigger defined for the existing RIC subscription based on the contents of the IE.
If the RIC Actions to be Removed List IE is included, then for every RIC Action ID IE included in the list, the E2 node shall delete the requested action and release the corresponding neccessary resources.
If the RIC Actions to be Modified List IE is included, then for every RIC Action ID IE included in the list for which there exists a corresponding RIC Action Definition IE and/or RIC Subsequent Action IE, the E2 node shall modify the existing behavior for the action with the requested modification in the respective IEs and modify the corresponding necessary resources.
If the RIC Actions to be Modified List IE is included, then for every RIC Action ID IE included in the list for which there exists a RIC Action Execution Order IE, the E2 node shall replace the current execution order for the action in the sequence of actions with the new execution order for the action in the sequence, as given in the RIC Action Execution Order IE.
If the RIC Actions to be Added List IE is included, then the E2 node shall validate and add the requested actions  to the existing sequence of RIC Actions in order of the RIC Action Execution Order IE and reserve the neccessary resources for the new actions.
The E2 node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION RESPONSE message back to the Near-RT RIC when one of the following cases is successfully executed:
-	If the RIC Event Trigger Definition to be Modified IE is present in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and if the requested modification for the event trigger definition was successfully performed by the E2 node, or
-	If the RIC Event Trigger Definition to be Modified IE is not present (i.e., no modification to the event trigger definition was requested) in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and if at least one of the requested actions to be added or modified or removed as requested by the Near-RT RIC in RIC Actions To Be Added List IE or RIC Actions to be Modified List IE or RIC Actions to be Removed List IE, respectively, in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, was successfully performed by the E2 node.
The E2 node shall report the result of all the requested modifications to the sequence of actions, if any, back to the Near-RT RIC in the RIC SUBSCRIPTION MODIFICATION RESPONSE message as follows:
-	A list of actions requested to be removed, indexed by the RIC Action ID IE, which are successfully removed by the E2 node, shall be included in the RIC Actions Removed List IE.
-	A list of actions requested to be removed, indexed by the RIC Action ID IE, which failed to get removed from the sequence by the E2 node, shall be included in the RIC Actions Failed to be Removed List IE, with appropriate cause values.

-	A list of actions requested to be added, indexed by the RIC Action ID IE, which failed to get added to the sequence by the E2 node, shall be included in the RIC Actions Failed to be Added List IE with appropriate cause values.
If, for a given RIC Action ID IE in the RIC Actions to be Modified List IE, more than one modification to the RIC Service Action is requested in the form of RIC Action Definition IE and/or RIC Action Execution Order IE and/or RIC Subsequent Action IE, then the E2 node shall report that the requested action modification is successfully performed and shall include the action in the RIC Actions Modified List IE, if and only if, all the requested modifications to the action are successfully performed by the E2 node.
If one of the requested modifications to the RIC Service Action is not successfully performed by the E2 node, then the E2 node shall include the RIC Service Action in the RIC Actions Failed to be Modified List IE, along with an appropriate cause, to indicate failure for the requested modification to the RIC Service Action.
If, for a given RIC Action ID IE in the RIC Actions to be Added IE, either the action type in the RIC Action Type IE or the action definition in the RIC Action Definition IE or the action execution order in the RIC Action Execution Order IE or the subsequent action, if included, in the RIC Subsequent Action IE is not successfully processed by the E2 node, then the E2 node shall include the action in the RIC Actions Failed to be Added List IE with an appropriate cause, indicating failure to add the requested action to the existing sequence of actions.
If, after processing the RIC Subscription Modification procedure, more than one RIC Service Action remains accepted by the E2 Node then, at each occurrence of the common Event Trigger, the sequence of RIC Service Actions shall be executed according to the considerations defined in clause 8.2.1.2.

Figure 8.3.5.2-1: E2 Node Configuration Update procedure, successful operation
An E2 Node initiates the procedure by sending a E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the Near-RT RIC. The message shall include an appropriate set of up-to-date E2 Node-related configuration data that the E2 Node has just taken into operational use.
Upon reception of the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall update the application level data for the E2 Node as follows:
Update of E2 Node configuration information in Near-RT RIC:
-	If E2 Node Component Configuration Addition List IE is contained in the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall add the E2 Node Component Configuration information accordingly.
-	If E2 Node Component Configuration Update List IE is contained in the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall modify the E2 Node Component Configuration information accordingly.
-	If E2 Node Component Configuration Removal List IE is contained in the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall remove the E2 Node Component Configuration information accordingly
If Global E2 Node ID IE is contained in the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message for a newly established SCTP association, the Near-RT RIC shall associate the TNL association with the related E2 Node.
If the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes E2 Node TNL Association To Remove List IE, and the Endpoint IP address IE and the Port Number IE for both TNL endpoints of the TNL association(s) are included in the E2 Node TNL Association To Remove List IE, the Near-RT RIC shall, if supported, consider that the TNL association(s) indicated by both received TNL endpoints will be removed by the E2 Node.
If the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes E2 Node TNL Association To Remove List IE, and the Endpoint IP address IE, or the Endpoint IP address IE and the Port Number IE for one or both of the TNL endpoints is included in the E2 Node TNL Association To Remove List IE in E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the Near-RT RIC shall, if supported, consider that the TNL association(s) indicated by the received endpoint IP address(es) will be removed by the E2 Node.
After successful update of requested information, Near-RT RIC shall reply with the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to inform the initiating E2 Node that the requested update of application level data was performed successfully.
If the Near-RT RIC receives a E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message without any IE except for Message Type IE and Transaction ID IE, the Near-RT RIC shall reply with the E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message without performing any updates to the existing configuration.

The Near-RT RIC initiates the procedure by sending a E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message to the E2 Node. The message shall include an appropriate set of up-to-date E2 interface connection data that the E2 Node shall take into account when modifying the E2 interface connection.
Upon reception of a E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message, the E2 Node shall update as follows:
If E2 Connection To Add List IE is contained in the E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message, then the E2 Node shall, if supported, use the information to establish additional TNL Association(s) and configure for use for RIC services and/or E2 support functions according to the TNL Association Usage IE in the message.
If E2 Connection To Modify List IE is contained in the E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message, then the E2 Node shall, if supported, use the information to modify the existing usage for RIC services and/or E2 support functions, according to the TNL Association Usage IE in the message.
If E2 Connection To Remove List IE is contained in the E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message, then the E2 Node shall, if supported, use the information to remove the existing connection(s). If only one connection remains after successful removal of other connections, the E2 Node shall use this remaining connection for all the RIC services and E2 support functions.
After successful update of E2 interface connection(s), the E2 Node shall reply with the E2 CONNECTION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to inform the initiating Near-RT RIC that the requested E2 connection update was performed successfully.
If the E2 Node receives a E2 CONNECTION UPDATE message without any IE except for Message Type IE and Transaction ID IE, the E2 Node shall reply with the E2 CONNECTION ACKNOWLEDGE message without performing any updates to the existing connections.
E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE procedure shall be the first E2AP procedure triggered on an additional TNLA of an already setup E2 interface instance after the TNL association has become operational, and the Near-RT RIC shall associate the TNLA to the E2 interface instance using the included Global E2 Node ID.
An empty E2 NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message (i.e. without any IE expect for Message Type IE and Transaction ID IE) shall be sent by the Near-RT RIC as the first E2AP procedure on the new TNLA, if the E2 Node does not have any Configuration to be updated to Near-RT RIC.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
E2AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 [15], ITU-T Rec. X.680 [16] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [17].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of E2AP messages. E2AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an E2AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If an E2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
9.3.2	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard are not supported with E2AP.
