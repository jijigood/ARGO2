Network Protocol and 	Service Enumeration
STC-7-7.2-001: Network Protocol and Service Enumeration
Requirement Name: Network protocol and service enumeration
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.3.3, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: A list of network protocols and services supported on the O-RAN component shall be clearly documented by its vendor. Unused protocols shall be disabled.
Threat References: T-O-RAN-01, T-O-RAN-02
O-RAN Component References: SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test description and applicability
The purpose of the test is to verify that list of active network protocols and services on running O-RAN component is in line with vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by the O-RAN component. Probing of network protocols and services on running O-RAN component provides the information whether the service is active or not.
NOTE 1: In practice, such probing is often referred to as network scanning or port scanning.
This test case shall probe all possible TCP and SCTP ports in range 0-65535 using port scanner for presence of the active services.
This test case shall probe all documented UDP ports from vendor-provided list using port scanner for presence of the active services. Optionally, additional UDP ports may be scanned as well.
Result of probing the running O-RAN component shall be a list of active network protocols and services. Each item shall contain network protocol (TCP, UDP, SCTP), port number (from range 0-65535) and service name. If service type cannot be determined during probing, service name shall be "unknown".
Service name should be in line with Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry defined by IANA [i.1] . If service name is not defined in [i.1], vendor provided service name should be used.
NOTE 2: In practice, services may also run on ports different from ports defined in [i.1].
O-RAN component configuration influences what network protocols and services are exposed as active. Service that is supported by O-RAN component may be disabled and therefore can be detected during probing as not active.
Comparison between the vendor-provided list of all supported network protocols and services and the list or active network protocols and services found by port scanner shall be performed.
Test setup and configuration
This test shall be executed against running O-RAN component as the DUT.
Test prerequisites:
Port scanner with capabilities as defined in clause 5.3 of present document
Network access to DUT
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Test procedure
List of open ports shall be determined as follows:
Port scanner shall scan all TCP ports in range 0-65535 on the IP interface of DUT. TCP SYN/ACK response by DUT shall be interpreted as open port.
Port scanner shall scan all SCTP ports in range 0-65535 on the IP interface of DUT. SCTP INIT-ACK response by DUT shall be interpreted as open port.
All UDP ports documented in vendor-provided list shall be interpreted as open ports. Other UDP ports may be considered as open for the purpose of service detection.
NOTE 3: Due to the nature of UDP protocol, there is no simple method of open port detection similar to TCP/SCTP methods based on analysis of response message type (TCP: SYN/ACK, SCTP: INIT-ACK). In case of UDP, open port detection inevitably relies on service detection which is discussed in step 2 of this test procedure. In practice, port scans of entire UDP port range 0-65535 are impractical and time consuming. Typically, service detection is performed only for subset of UDP ports. UDP port subset selection is arbitrary and not standardized. Service detection in this test procedure is required for UDP ports from vendor-provided list and is optional for other UDP ports.
For each open port from previous step, port scanner shall perform service detection by sending service probe(s) as follows:
If open port is listed in vendor-provided list, port scanner shall use service probe from its built-in database that exactly matches service documented in vendor-provided list.
If open port is not listed in vendor-provided list, port scanner should use service probe from its built-in database that exactly matches service defined in [i.1] for the that open port. If such service is not defined in [i.1], port scanner may report service as "unknown". Alternatively, port scanner may perform further service detection attempts based on other service probes from its built-in database.
NOTE 4: Service detection for open ports that are also listed in vendor-provided list requires only one probe. Finding any open ports that are not listed in vendor-provided list means this test case fails. However, service information can be helpful in discussion with DUT vendor. This test procedure therefore accommodates optional service detection based on one probe or multiple probes.
Port scanner shall produce list of detected active network protocols, ports and services on DUT.
Expected results
All services found by port scanner shall be documented in vendor-provided list. This test case shall end with success if:
both lists match exactly
list of network protocols and services found by port scanner has fewer items than vendor-provided list; all items found by port scanner exactly match items from vendor-provided list.
If any service is found by port scanner and it is not documented in vendor-provided list, this test case shall fail. It means that vendor-provided list is incorrect and undocumented attack surface exists.
Password-Based Authentication
STC-7-7.3-001: Password guessing
Requirement Name: Password-Based Authentication
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.3.7, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Password guessing protection mechanism is present on the DUT
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-03, T-O-RAN-05, T-O-RAN-06
O-RAN Component References: SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test description and applicability
The purpose of the test is to verify that running O-RAN component has protection mechanism(s) implemented to prevent password guessing attacks against services using password-based authentication.
NOTE 1: In practice, brute-forcing and dictionary attacks are the most common classes of password guessing attacks. Traditional approach to brute-forcing and dictionary attacks uses fixed username with various candidate passwords. Password spraying is another approach that can be combined with brute-forcing and dictionary attacks; fixed password is tested with various candidate usernames. Example of protection mechanism is enforcing delay before next authentication attempt(s) by the same client. This test case cannot list all possible techniques that protection mechanisms can use. However, following list provides overview of the most common approaches:
Increase the delay after each unsuccessful authentication attempt.
Implement challenge-response authentication (example of such measure: CAPTCHA)
In order to prevent more attempts, impose temporary lock out on the client when threshold of consecutive failed authentication attempts is reached. During defined period of time all authentication attempts by locked-out client shall be rejected.
Simulation of password guessing attacks against services on running O-RAN component provides the information whether any protection mechanism is present.
This test case shall be run against all services on running O-RAN component that use password-based authentication. Vendor-provided list of all supported network protocols and services shall be used as a source.
NOTE 2: Vendor-provided list of all supported network protocols and services may not include the specific information about presence of password-based authentication as it is including network protocol, port and service name. In practice, only subset of services from vendor-provided list will use password-based authentication.
This test case shall not mandate any specific list of passwords to be used for testing.
Test setup and configuration
This test shall be executed against running O-RAN component as the DUT.
Test prerequisites:
Valid username for each tested service
Network access to DUT
Physical access to DUT (applicable if the DUT is in physical form)
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Test procedure
List of services using password-based authentication shall be determined by analyzing the vendor-provided list as well as by analyzing local services that are not remotely accessible.
For services identified in the previous step, presence of protection mechanism shall be test as follows:
combination of valid username and invalid password (or various invalid passwords) shall be used for authentication repeatedly.
after certain number of authentication attempts, protection mechanism of DUT shall be detected.
minimum number of authentication attempts shall be 11.
protection mechanism(s) shall be detected after 10 authentication attempts or fewer.
EXAMPLE: If DUT uses protection mechanism based on delaying authentication attempts, such delay shall be observed at the latest when DUT receives 11th consecutive invalid authentication attempt.
Expected results
In context of each of the services using password-based authentication, protection mechanism(s) shall be present. Applicable to local services and to remotely accessible services.
This test case shall fail if one or more services using password-based authentication have no protection mechanism present.
STC-7-7.3-002: Unauthorized Password Reset
Requirement Name: Password-Based Authentication
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.3.7, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Out-of-band password recovery mechanism absent or deactivated on DUT
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-03, T-O-RAN-05, T-O-RAN-06
O-RAN Component References: SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test description and applicability
The purpose of this test is to verify that password reset mechanism of running O-RAN component cannot be circumvented, disabled or misused to gain access to O-RAN component, its configuration and data.
Test shall cover services using password-based authentication and out-of-band mechanisms of  password reset present in O-RAN components in physical form.
If password reset is required, factory reset of O-RAN component shall be performed. Factory reset shall wipe O-RAN component, its configuration and data.
Test setup and configuration
This test shall be executed against running O-RAN component as the DUT.
Test prerequisites:
Network access to DUT
Physical access to DUT (applicable if the DUT is in physical form)
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Test procedure
List of services using password-based authentication shall be determined by analyzing the vendor-provided list as well as by analyzing local services that are not remotely accessible.
For services identified in the previous step, presence of password reset shall be tested.
For DUT that has physical form, it shall be verified that use of hardware factory reset switch or switches results in factory reset. Using any out-of-band mechanism, it shall not be possible to reset password only.
Expected results
In context of each of the services using password-based authentication, no password change mechanism shall be present. Applicable to local services and to remotely accessible services.
This test case shall fail if one or more services using password-based authentication have password reset mechanism exposed.
This test case shall fail if DUT in physical form has hardware switch or switches that can be used to reset password without triggering factory reset of DUT.
STC-7-7.3-003: Password Policy Enforcement
Requirement Name: Password-Based Authentication
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.3.7, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Secure password policy is supported and enforced on the DUT
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-03, T-O-RAN-05, T-O-RAN-06
O-RAN Component References: SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test description and applicability
The purpose of this test is to verify that password policy applied for services using password-based authentication is effectively enforced by running O-RAN component.
Test setup and configuration
This test shall be executed against running O-RAN component as the DUT.
Test prerequisites:
Set of valid username and valid password for each tested service
Network access to DUT
Physical access to DUT (applicable if the DUT is in physical form)
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Test procedure
List of services using password-based authentication shall be determined by analyzing the vendor-provided list as well as by analyzing local services that are not remotely accessible.
For services identified in the previous step, effectiveness of password policy enforcement shall be verified as follows:
combination of valid username and valid password shall be used to authenticate
password change shall be performed using password that does not conform to applied password policy password change shall be rejected by DUT
EXAMPLE: DUT uses password policy to set rules for password length, type of characters used (allowed and disallowed characters), complexity (character groups), and denied passwords (deny-list of passwords that cannot be set). Candidate password that does not conform to rules shall be chosen for this test. As password policy may be complex set of rules, multiple candidate password should be tested to fully cover possible password policy violations.
Expected results
In context of each of the services using password-based authentication, applied password policy shall be effectively enforced and non-compliant passwords shall be rejected by DUT during password change. Applicable to local services and to remotely accessible services.
Network Protocol Fuzzing
Fuzzing is an automated process of sending invalid or random inputs to a SUT to cause it to malfunction or crash.
Fuzzing is effective for finding vulnerabilities because while most modern programs have extensive input fields, the test coverage of these areas is relatively small. Even though this process can be a powerful capability to ensure robustness, it needs to be sufficiently defined and implemented throughout the system development lifecycle to be helpful and achieve the required results in a multi-vendor environment.
While traditional fuzzing techniques involve fuzzing piece(s) of software and generating inputs through command line or input files, fuzzing telecommunication network protocols tends to be different, requiring sending information via network ports. Furthermore, the complex nature of network protocols in the SUT resulting from how they are layered over each other adds to the challenges of fuzzing such SUTs.
In the case of O-RAN SUT, fuzzing cover protocols rather than application-specific (web applications and services, etc.). The following are examples of the protocols that fuzzing will cover;
and
It is anticipated that many O-RAN components utilize common software frameworks used for the lower-level general communication. In this case it should be evaluated if these General Transport Protocols are being tested in extensive Fuzzing tests in other activities and can therefore be considered to have lower risk profiles compared to the O-RAN Specific Protocols with less testing in the general industry.
Many of the O-RAN specific protocols are state- machine based protocols that can have multiple end points served at the same time, e.g. the protocol needs to be tested in scale to understand if possible memory leaks or other similar aspects is available that could lead to buffer overflows (opening up for possible code execution) or software crashes of the O-RAN specific software.
Fuzzing on the M-Plane protocol inside the Configuration of the O-RAN Fronthaul can be a possible significant area as this is combining multiple technologies from many domains into a single solution. In order for the Fuzzing to be time and resource efficient, it is important that this Fuzzing is protocol and state machine aware so that the Fuzzing can focus on the relevant aspects of the SUT representing the most significant risk exposure. Further effectiveness can be achieved if the Fuzzing capability is able to intelligently respond to the SUT behavior. The Fuzzing tool should be able to both perform test with and without access to relevant credentials. Many possible vulnerabilities would be present on the inside of the authenticated session of the management protocols and would lead to escalation of privileges.
In order to identify the possible risk for memory leaks, Denial of Service (DoS) or other similar aspects a robust logging of the underlying platform (hardware and software), the virtualization or container platform and the O-RAN function, the logging needs to be detailed enough to evaluate the trends early but not intrusive to degrade the performance of the platform and lead to inaccurate results.
As general guidance, vendors and operators running fuzzing tests aim to document the list of all of the protocols of the SUTs reachable externally on an IP-based interface, together with indications of whether adequate available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used against them. The tool's name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), user settings, and the relevant output evidenced and should be documented. Additionally, any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behavior and a description of this behavior should be highlighted in the testing documentation.
Since fuzzing test cases are not exhaustive and difficult to define and replicate, it's likely that test results even from testing the same set of protocols by different vendors may end up resulting in different outputs. So further effort and time needs to be invested in fuzzing activities until a satisfactory approach based on the vendor's or/and operators adopted risk-based model is satisfied.
Denial of Service/Message Flooding
STC-7-7.5-001: Protocol, Application and Volumetric Based DDoS Attacks
Requirement Name:  Robustness against Volumetric DDoS Attack
Requirement Reference: Clause 5.3.5, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: REQ-SEC-DOS-1: An O-RAN component with external network interface shall be able to withstand network transport protocol based volumetric DDoS attack without system crash and returning to normal service level after the attack
Threat References: T-O-RAN-04, T-O-RAN-09, T-SMO-03

Test description and applicability
Each component interface shall be tested to validate how handling of large amounts of requests is done, similar to what is seen from denial of service (DoS) or/and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attempts. DoS/DDoS scenario can be occurred as a result of malicious attack or because of network/operator error. DoS/DDoS attacks may come in these forms: Protocol layer attacks (e.g. SYN Floods, UDP Floods, TCP Floods), Volume based attacks (e.g. ICMP floods, Smurf DDoS) and Application layer attacks (e.g. GET/POST floods, low-and-slow attacks, attacks that target specific software – application with exposed network services or operating system network services).
Test setup and configuration
This test shall be executed against running O-RAN component or O-RAN system as the DUT.
Test prerequisites:
Network access to DUT
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Test procedure
In case the call flow needs authentication:
Set up a call flow that will send repeated requests after the authentication at an increasing rate over time. Mark the failure point of receiving rejection or response messages.
Stop the attack.
Set up a call flow that will send repeated requests before the authentication at an increasing rate over time. Mark the failure point of receiving acceptance or response messages.
Stop the attack.
In case the call flow does not need authentication:
Set up a call flow that will send repeated requests at an increasing rate over time. Mark the failure point of receiving response messages.
Stop the attack.
Expected results
It is expected the component could fail to serve requests after step 1.1, 1.3 and/or step 2.1.
After the attack/test stops, the DUT shall return to a functional state, being able to respond to service requests again.
This test case shall fail if DUT does not return to a functional state after the test stops.
