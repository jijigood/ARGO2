Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations
Terms
For definitions of the security terms Attack, Attack surface, Risk, Security control, Technical control, Threat, and Vulnerability used in this document, refer to [i.5].
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [6], O-RAN Architecture Description [1], and the following in this clause apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [6] and O-RAN Architecture Description [1].
A1: Interface between non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC to enable policy-driven guidance of Near-RT RIC applications/functions, and support AI/ML workflow.
E2: Interface connecting the Near-RT RIC and one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs.
RAN: Generally referred as Radio Access Network. In terms of this document, any component below Near-RT RIC per O-RAN architecture, including O-CU/O-DU/O-RU.
Overcommitting resources: The practice of allocating or promising more resources than are physically available on a system. This concept is commonly used in virtualized and cloud environments. The idea behind overcommitment is to optimize resource utilization based on the observation that not all applications will use their allocated resources to the maximum at the same time. Here's a breakdown of overcommitment for different resources:
CPU Overcommitment: More virtual CPUs (vCPUs) are allocated to VMs or Containers than there are physical CPU cores available on the host.
Memory Overcommitment: The total memory allocated to VMs or Containers exceeds the physical RAM available on the host.
Storage Overcommitment: More storage space is allocated to VMs or Containers than the actual available capacity on the storage device.
Network Overcommitment: More bandwidth is promised to VMs or Containers than the physical network can provide.
Overcommit ratios: The extent to which resources can be overallocated compared to the actual available physical resources.
CPU Overcommit Ratio: A CPU overcommit ratio of 2:1 indicates that twice the number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) can be allocated compared to the physical CPU cores available on the host. For instance, if a server has 8 physical CPU cores, 16 vCPUs could be allocated across various VMs or Containers.

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to verify the robustness of the IKEv2 server when faced with malformed IKE headers. Flags within the IKE header are intended to provide specific instructions or information about the message. By fuzzing these flags, we can identify potential vulnerabilities or flaws in the server's processing logic.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
A controlled environment with an IKEv2 server and a test client.
Packet capture tool (e.g., Wireshark) for monitoring the traffic.
Fuzzing tool or script to generate malformed IKE header flags.
Execution steps
Begin by starting the packet capture tool to record the test session.
Use the fuzzing tool or script to generate IKEv2 messages with the following malformed flags in the IKE header:
Initiator flag: Flip this flag to see if the server can identify a message that isn’t from an initiator.
Version flag: Introduce an unsupported version.
Response flag: Send messages that have this flag inappropriately set.
Combination of multiple flags: Mix flags to generate completely unexpected combinations.
Send each of these malformed messages to the IKEv2 server individually, waiting for a response before sending the next.
Observe server reactions, looking specifically for any unhandled exceptions, crashes, or irregular behaviours.
Expected Results
The IKEv2 server handles the malformed flags gracefully, either by rejecting the message or by ignoring the unexpected flag values.
There is no crashes, hangs, or undefined behaviours.
Expected format of evidence
Packet capture files (.pcap) showing the malformed flags sent and the server's responses.
Server logs indicating the handling (or rejection) of the malformed messages.

Requirement Name: Network Security Protocol - IPsec
Requirement Reference: Clause 4.5, O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [2]
Requirement Description: Support IPsec tunnel mode with confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and replay protection.
Threat References: T-O-RAN-01
DUT/s: Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU
Test Name: TC_IKE_KEY_EXCHANGE_PAYLOAD_FUZZING
Purpose: The purpose of this test is to examine the IKEv2 server's ability to manage corrupted or unexpected data within the Key Exchange (KE) payload. The KE payload carries the Diffie-Hellman public value. If the server is unable to handle malformed KE payloads, it might be susceptible to attacks or crashes.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
A controlled environment with an IKEv2 server and a test client.
Packet capture tool (e.g., Wireshark) for monitoring the traffic.
Fuzzing tool or script capable of generating malformed KE payloads.
Execution steps
Initiate the packet capture tool to ensure every detail of the test session is recorded.
Use your fuzzing tool or script to generate IKEv2 messages with the following specific manipulations in the KE payloads:
Unexpected length: Prepare 10 distinct messages where the KE payload's declared length is longer or shorter than the actual payload.
Corrupted data: Generate 10 messages introducing random bytes into the KE payload to see how the server handles non-standard values.
Unsupported Diffie-Hellman groups: Create 5 messages attempting to initiate a key exchange using a DH group that is either deprecated or not supported by the server.
Empty KE payload: Formulate 5 messages with an empty KE payload.
Sequentially send these 30 malformed messages to the IKEv2 server. After sending each message, wait for the server's response to avoid overloading it. Ensure the following sequence:
Send the 10 "Unexpected Length" messages.
Follow with the 10 "Corrupted Data" messages.
Continue with the 5 "Unsupported Diffie-Hellman Groups" messages.
Conclude with the 5 "Empty KE Payload" messages.
NOTE:	Monitor the server's reactions closely. The server ideally handles errors gracefully, either ignoring them or responding with an appropriate error message, without any crashes or hangs.
Expected Results
The IKEv2 server gracefully handles the malformed KE payloads, either by ignoring them, responding with an error, or requesting a valid KE payload.
No crashes, hangs, or undefined behaviours occur.
Expected format of evidence
Packet capture files (.pcap) highlighting the malformed KE payloads and the server's corresponding responses.
Server logs detailing the handling (or rejection) of the malformed KE payloads.
IKE Malformed Certificate Payload
Requirement Name: Network Security Protocol - IPsec
Requirement Reference: Clause 4.5, O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [2]
Requirement Description: Support IPsec tunnel mode with confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and replay protection.
Threat References: T-O-RAN-01
DUT/s: Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU
Test Name: TC_IKE_MALFORMED_CERTIFICATE_PAYLOAD
Purpose: This test aims to verify the IKEv2 server's capability to properly validate certificate payloads. Certificate payloads are essential in the IKEv2 authentication phase. A server vulnerable to malformed certificate payloads could be susceptible to impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
A controlled environment with an IKEv2 server and a test client.
Packet capture tool (e.g., Wireshark) to monitor and capture traffic.
A set of both valid and deliberately malformed certificates.
Execution steps
Valid Certificate Test:
Initiate an IKEv2 session using a valid certificate to ensure baseline functionality.
Confirm successful authentication and session establishment.
Expired Certificate:
Use a previously valid certificate that has now expired.
Attempt to initiate an IKEv2 session.
Observe the server's rejection of this certificate.
Certificate with Invalid Signature:
Modify a valid certificate's content slightly (e.g., change an attribute) without re-signing it. This will invalidate its signature.
Attempt to initiate an IKEv2 session using this certificate.
The server detects the invalid signature and rejects the connection.
Certificate from Untrusted Authority:
Generate a new certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that the IKEv2 server doesn't trust or recognize.
Attempt to initiate a connection using this certificate.
Observe the server rejecting the certificate due to the untrusted CA.
Certificate with Modified Subject/Issuer Fields:
Modify the subject or issuer fields of a certificate to contain irregular or unexpected values (e.g., overly long strings, special characters).
Use this certificate to initiate an IKEv2 session.
The server validates these fields, notices the irregularities, and potentially rejects the connection.
Certificate with Invalid Key Usage:
Use a certificate that doesn't have "key encipherment" or "digital signature" as its key usage, which are typically needed for IKEv2 operations.
Attempt to initiate a session.
The server detects the inappropriate key usage and declines the connection.
Expected Results:
For the valid certificate, the IKEv2 server authenticates successfully and establish a session.
For all other scenarios, the IKEv2 server detects the certificate anomalies and rejects the connection attempts. Specific error messages or logs relating to certificate validation failure are generated.
Expected format of evidence:
Packet capture files (.pcap) capturing the entire exchange, showing the certificate exchange and the server's response.
Server logs detailing the acceptance or rejection of each certificate, with corresponding reasons or error messages for rejections.

Network Protocol and Service Enumeration
Network Protocol and Service Enumeration
Requirement Name: Network protocol and service enumeration
Requirement Reference: REQ-SEC-NET-1, clause 5.3.3.1, O-RAN Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Protocols and services are documented by vendor. No undocumented protocols and services are offered.
Threat References: T-O-RAN-01, T-O-RAN-02
DUT/s: SMO, Non-RT RIC and rApps, Near-RT RIC and xApps, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test name: TC_Network_Procotol_And_Enumeration
Purpose: To verify that the list of active network protocols and services on DUT is in line with vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported. Probing of network protocols and services on DUT provides the information whether the service is active or not. This test case probes all possible TCP and SCTP ports in range 0-65535 using port scanner for presence of the active services.
This test case probes all documented UDP ports from vendor-provided list using port scanner for presence of the active services. Optionally, additional UDP ports may be scanned as well.
NOTE 1:	In practice, such probing is often referred to as network scanning or port scanning.
NOTE 2:	In practice, services may also run on ports different from ports defined in [i.1].
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
Port scanner with capabilities as defined in clause 5.3 of present document.
Network access to DUT
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Execution steps
List of open ports is determined as follows:
Port scanner scans all TCP ports in range 0-65535 on the IP interface of DUT. TCP SYN/ACK response by DUT are interpreted as open port.
Port scanner scans all SCTP ports in range 0-65535 on the IP interface of DUT. SCTP INIT-ACK response by DUT are interpreted as open port.
All UDP ports documented in vendor-provided list are interpreted as open ports. Other UDP ports may be considered as open for the purpose of service detection.
NOTE 3:	Due to the nature of UDP protocol, there is no simple method of open port detection similar to TCP/SCTP methods based on analysis of response message type (TCP: SYN/ACK, SCTP: INIT-ACK). In case of UDP, open port detection inevitably relies on service detection which is discussed in step 2 of this test procedure. In practice, port scans of entire UDP port range 0-65535 are impractical and time consuming. Typically, service detection is performed only for subset of UDP ports. UDP port subset selection is arbitrary and not standardized. Service detection in this test procedure is required for UDP ports from vendor-provided list and is optional for other UDP ports.
For each open port from previous step, port scanner performs service detection by sending service probe(s) as follows:
If open port is listed in vendor-provided list, port scanner uses service probe from its built-in database that exactly matches service documented in vendor-provided list.
If open port is not listed in vendor-provided list, port scanner uses service probe from its built-in database that exactly matches service defined in [i.1] for the that open port. If such service is not defined in [i.1], port scanner may report service as "unknown". Alternatively, port scanner may perform further service detection attempts based on other service probes from its built-in database.
NOTE 4:	Service detection for open ports that are also listed in vendor-provided list requires only one probe. However, service information can be helpful in discussion with DUT vendor. This test procedure therefore accommodates optional service detection based on one probe or multiple probes.
Port scanner produces list of detected active network protocols, ports and services on DUT.
Expected results
Comparison between the vendor-provided list of all supported network protocols and services and the list or active network protocols and services found by port scanner is performed.
All services found by port scanner are documented in vendor-provided list. This test case ends with success if:
both lists match exactly
list of network protocols and services found by port scanner has fewer items than vendor-provided list; all items found by port scanner exactly match items from vendor-provided list.
If any service is found by port scanner and it is not documented in vendor-provided list, this test case shall fail. It means that vendor-provided list is incorrect and undocumented attack surface exists.
Expected format of evidence: Result of probing the DUT is a list of active network protocols and services. Each item contains network protocol (TCP, UDP, SCTP), port number (from range 0-65535) and service name. If service type cannot be determined during probing, service name is "unknown".
Service name is in line with Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry defined by IANA [i.1] . If service name is not defined in [i.1], vendor provided service name is used.
Password-Based Authentication
Password guessing
Requirement Name: Password-Based Authentication
Requirement Reference: SEC-CTL-PASS-2, clause 5.5.7.2, REQ-SEC-PASS-1, clause 5.3.7.1, O-RAN Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Password guessing protection mechanism is present on the DUT
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-05, T-O-RAN-06
DUT/s: SMO, Non-RT RIC and rApps, Near-RT RIC and xApps, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test Name: TC_Password_Guessing
Purpose: To verify that DUT has protection mechanism(s) implemented to prevent password guessing attacks against services using password-based authentication. . Simulation of password guessing attacks against services on DUT provides the information whether any protection mechanism is present.
This test case is run against all services on DUT that use password-based authentication. Vendor-provided list of all supported network protocols and services are used as a source.
NOTE 1:	Vendor-provided list of all supported network protocols and services may not include the specific information about presence of password-based authentication as it is including network protocol, port and service name. In practice, only subset of services from vendor-provided list will use password-based authentication.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
Valid username for each tested service. This test case does not mandate any specific list of passwords to be used for testing.
Network access to DUT
Physical access to DUT (applicable if the DUT is in physical form)
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Number of authentication attempts configured in account lock-out policy
Execution steps
List of services using password-based authentication is determined by analysing the vendor-provided list as well as by analysing local services that are not remotely accessible.
For services identified in the previous step, presence of protection mechanism is tested as follows:
combination of valid username and invalid password (or various invalid passwords) are used for authentication repeatedly.
after certain number of authentication attempts, protection mechanism of DUT are detected.
minimum number of authentication attempts is the calculated as (number configured in the lock-out policy + 1) attempts.
Expected results
In context of each of the services using password-based authentication, protection mechanism(s) is present. Applicable to local services and to remotely accessible services.
NOTE 2:	In practice, brute-forcing and dictionary attacks are the most common classes of password guessing attacks. Traditional approach to brute-forcing and dictionary attacks uses fixed username with various candidate passwords. Password spraying is another approach that can be combined with brute-forcing and dictionary attacks; fixed password is tested with various candidate usernames. Example of protection mechanism is enforcing delay before next authentication attempt(s) by the same client. This test case cannot list all possible techniques that protection mechanisms can use. However, following list provides overview of the most common approaches:
Increase the delay after each unsuccessful authentication attempt.
Implement challenge-response authentication (example of such measure: CAPTCHA)
In order to prevent more attempts, impose temporary lock out on the client when threshold of consecutive failed authentication attempts is reached. During defined period of time all authentication attempts by locked-out client are rejected.
EXAMPLE:	Lock-out policy is configured for 10 invalid authentication attempts. If DUT uses protection mechanism based on delaying authentication attempts, such delay is observed when DUT receives 11th consecutive invalid authentication attempt.
This test case fails if one or more services using password-based authentication have no protection mechanism present.
Expected format of evidence: Report file, log files and/or screenshots.
Unauthorized Password Reset
Requirement Name: Password-Based Authentication
Requirement Reference: REQ-SEC-PASS-1, clause 5.3.7.1, O-RAN Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Out-of-band password recovery mechanism absent or deactivated on DUT
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-05, T-O-RAN-06
DUT/s: SMO, Non-RT RIC and rApps, Near-RT RIC and xApps, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test Name: TC_Unauthorized_Password_Reset
Purpose: To verify that password reset mechanism DUT cannot be circumvented, disabled, or misused to gain access to DUT, its configuration, and data. Test covers services using password-based authentication and out-of-band mechanisms of password reset present in DUT in physical form.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
Network access to DUT
Physical access to DUT (applicable if the DUT is in physical form)
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Execution steps
List of services using password-based authentication are determined by analysing the vendor-provided list as well as by analysing local services that are not remotely accessible.
For services identified in the previous step, presence of password reset is tested.
For DUT that has physical form, it verifies that use of hardware factory reset switch or switches results in factory reset. Using any out-of-band mechanism, it is not possible to reset password only. If password reset is required, factory reset of O-RAN architecture element is performed. Factory reset wipes O-RAN architecture element, its configuration and data.
Expected results
In context of each of the services using password-based authentication, no password change mechanism is present. Applicable to local services and to remotely accessible services.
This test case fails if one or more services using password-based authentication have password reset mechanism exposed.
This test case fails if DUT in physical form has hardware switch or switches that can be used to reset password without triggering factory reset of DUT.
Expected format of evidence: Report file, log files and/or screenshots.
Password Policy Enforcement
Requirement Name: Password-Based Authentication
Requirement Reference: REQ-SEC-PASS-1, clause 5.3.7.1, O-RAN Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Secure password policy is supported and enforced on the DUT
Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-03, T-O-RAN-05, T-O-RAN-06
DUT/s: SMO, Non-RT RIC and rApps, Near-RT RIC and xApps, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud
Test Name: TC_Password_Policy_Enforcement
Purpose: To verify that password policy applied for services using password-based authentication is effectively enforced by DUT.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
Set of valid username and valid password for each tested service
Network access to DUT
Physical access to DUT (applicable if the DUT is in physical form)
Vendor-provided list of network protocols and services supported by DUT
Password policy that is actually applied on the DUT
Execution steps
List of services using password-based authentication is determined by analyzing the vendor-provided list as well as by analyzing local services that are not remotely accessible.
For services identified in the previous step, effectiveness of password policy enforcement is verified as follows:
combination of valid username and valid password are used to authenticate
password change is performed using password that does not conform to applied password policy
EXAMPLE:	DUT uses password policy to set rules for password length, type of characters used (allowed and disallowed characters), complexity (character groups), and denied passwords (deny-list of passwords that cannot be set). Candidate password that does not conform to rules are chosen for this test. As password policy may be complex set of rules, multiple candidate passwords are tested to fully cover possible password policy violations.
Expected results
In context of each of the services using password-based authentication, applied password policy are effectively enforced and non-compliant passwords are rejected by DUT during password change. Applicable to local services and to remotely accessible services.
Expected format of evidence: Report file, log files and/or screenshots.
Network Protocol Fuzzing
Fuzzing is an automated process of sending invalid or random inputs to a SUT to cause it to malfunction or crash.
Fuzzing is effective for finding vulnerabilities because while most modern programs have extensive input fields, the test coverage of these areas is relatively small. Even though this process can be a powerful capability to ensure robustness, it needs to be sufficiently defined and implemented throughout the system development lifecycle to be helpful and achieve the required results in a multi-vendor environment.
While traditional fuzzing techniques involve fuzzing piece(s) of software and generating inputs through command line or input files, fuzzing telecommunication network protocols tends to be different, requiring sending information via network ports. Furthermore, the complex nature of network protocols in the SUT resulting from how they are layered over each other adds to the challenges of fuzzing such SUTs.
The following are examples of the protocols that fuzzing will cover;
and
It is anticipated that many O-RAN architecture elements utilize common software frameworks used for the lower-level general communication. In this case it should be evaluated if these General Transport Protocols are being tested in extensive Fuzzing tests in other activities and can therefore be considered to have lower risk profiles compared to the O-RAN Specific Protocols with less testing in the general industry.
Many of the O-RAN specific protocols are state- machine based protocols that can have multiple end points served at the same time, e.g. the protocol needs to be tested in scale to understand if possible memory leaks or other similar aspects is available that could lead to buffer overflows (opening up for possible code execution) or software crashes of the O-RAN specific software.
Fuzzing on the M-Plane protocol inside the Configuration of the O-RAN Fronthaul can be a possible significant area as this is combining multiple technologies from many domains into a single solution. In order for the Fuzzing to be time and resource efficient, it is important that this Fuzzing is protocol and state machine aware so that the Fuzzing can focus on the relevant aspects of the SUT representing the most significant risk exposure. Further effectiveness can be achieved if the Fuzzing capability is able to intelligently respond to the SUT behaviour. The Fuzzing tool should be able to both perform test with and without access to relevant credentials. Many possible vulnerabilities would be present on the inside of the authenticated session of the management protocols and would lead to escalation of privileges.
In order to identify the possible risk for memory leaks, Denial of Service (DoS) or other similar aspects a robust logging of the underlying platform (hardware and software), the virtualization or container platform and the O-RAN function, the logging needs to be detailed enough to evaluate the trends early but not intrusive to degrade the performance of the platform and lead to inaccurate results.
As general guidance, vendors and operators running fuzzing tests aim to document the list of all of the protocols of the SUTs reachable externally on an IP-based interface, together with indications of whether adequate available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used against them. The tool's name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), user settings, and the relevant output evidenced and should be documented. Additionally, any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour and a description of this behaviour should be highlighted in the testing documentation.
Since fuzzing test cases are not exhaustive and difficult to define and replicate, it's likely that test results even from testing the same set of protocols by different vendors may end up resulting in different outputs. So further effort and time needs to be invested in fuzzing activities until a satisfactory approach based on the vendor's or/and operators adopted risk-based model is satisfied.

Threat References: T-FRHAUL-02
DUT/s: O-DU
Test Name: TC_Port_Access_Enforcement_Validation
Purpose: To verify that the DUT, when acting as an 802.1X authenticator, enforces port-based access control by allowing only EAPoL frames prior to authentication, and blocking all other Ethernet traffic—including frames carrying IP packets—until EAP-TLS authentication is successfully established.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions

The DUT is connected to a test tool or host representing a network device attempting to access the Open FH.
Execution steps
Unauthenticated traffic attempt: Connect the test tool to the DUT port. Without initiating any 802.1X (EAPoL) authentication, attempt to send standard Ethernet traffic such as ARP requests, ICMP echo (ping), and TCP SYN packets toward the DUT.
Authenticated traffic attempt: Configure the test tool to act as a supplicant and initiate a full 802.1X authentication using valid EAP-TLS credentials. Upon successful authentication and port authorization, re-attempt sending the same Ethernet traffic.
Expected results
Unauthenticated traffic attempt: The DUT blocks all Ethernet frames. The port remains in the unauthorized state.
Authenticated traffic attempt: The DUT authorizes the port and permits all Ethernet traffic.

S-Plane
Introduction
The tests outlined in this clause focus on PTP as a packet-based clock synchronization protocol, which is susceptible to various network-based attacks. The LLS-C1, LLS-C2, and LLS-C3 configurations are considered in this assessment, as they rely on external timeTransmitters for synchronization. In contrast, LLS-C4 features a local PRTC (Primary Reference Time Clock) embedded within the O-RU, which provides time synchronization internally to the O-RU. This local PRTC operates independently and does not rely on an external timeTransmitter, such as an O-DU or a PRTC/T-GM in the Open Fronthaul (Open FH), to maintain synchronization. Consequently, there is no external network communication path that could be exploited to disrupt synchronization in the O-RU. Additionally, while LLS-C4 may be vulnerable to GNSS-related attacks, such attacks are not considered in the current set of tests.
DoS Attack against a timeTransmitter
Introduction
The tests outlined in this clause evaluate the system's defence capabilities against DoS attacks targeting the timeTransmitter, especially in different LLS configurations.
DoS timeTransmitter LLS C1 C2 C3
Refer to the test case in clause 7.5.1 for test verification
DoS timeTransmitter LLS C4
NOTE:	In LLS-C4, the local PRTC is embedded in the O-RU and provides time synchronization internally to the O-RU. This local PRTC does not depend on an external timeTransmitter, such as the O-DU or a PRTC/T-GM in Open FH, to maintain its synchronization. Therefore, there is no external network communication path where a DoS attack targeting a timeTransmitter could be launched.
Spoofing of timeTransmitters in the S-Plane
Introduction
The tests presented in this clause focus on assessing the system's defences against potential spoofing attacks on timeTransmitters. Specifically, these tests examine scenarios where attackers may try to impersonate or manipulate the timeTransmitter's communications to disrupt accurate time synchronization.

The data is being received at or below a pre-defined rate.
The Near-RT RIC shall log security event(s) if any of the verification steps fail.
Threat References: T-NEAR-RT-01, T-xApp-01
DUT/s: Near-RT RIC
Test Name: TC_E2_Interface_data_validation_by_NearRTRIC
Purpose: To validate the E2 traffic that is received by Near-RT RIC via E2 interface. The Near-RT RIC uses E2 interface to collect near real-time information (EXAMPLE:- UE basis, Cell basis) and provide value added services. These real-time information needs to be validated when it gets received at Near-RT RIC and security events are to be logged if data validation fails. E2 interface connects the Near-Real-Time RIC with other E2 nodes like O-CU, O-DU, and O-eNB.
Procedure and execution steps
EXAMPLE 1:	One of the incoming data values to the Near-RT RIC are the measurement reports (carried in E2 Indication messages) that include:
Channel quality reports: Signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and modulation quality.
Interference reports: Identifying sources of interference.
Load reports: Current load on E2 nodes
Preconditions
Client is the test system which simulates E2 data traffic towards Near-RT RIC. This includes all the supported E2 support services (EXAMPLE: E2 RESET procedure), Measurement reports and other supported services. Test system is also capable of simulating multiple E2 connections where E2 traffic can be pushed.
Near-RT RIC is fully operational and data value validation in Near-RT RIC is defined, and the pre-defined data threshold rate is set. By fully operational Near-RT RIC, this means the Near-RT RIC is enabled with necessary xApps and configurations at the platform level.
Client system is logged in and the initial control connections are up with Near-RT RIC. At this point the Near-RT RIC has subscribed with E2 Nodes in the Client system and is expecting data at a predefined rate.
Login to the DUT with authorized credentials and start data collection required for checking the data handling.
Execution steps
From the client system, Initiate the E2 traffic with valid data values towards Near-RT RIC over single E2 connection
From the client test system, Initiate the E2 traffic with valid data on multiple E2 connections simultaneously
From the client test system, initiate invalid E2 traffic data
EXAMPLE 2:	Invalid values (or) Invalid format in the measurement reports (or) Invalid E2 Node configuration information sent in E2 setup request (or) Invalid cause in the E2 reset request
From the client test system, initiate the E2 data which is equal to the Near-RT RIC predefined data rate via multiple E2 connections simultaneously
From the client test system, initiate sudden burst of E2 data which is more than the Near-RT RIC predefined data rate via multiple E2 connections simultaneously
Expected results
After step 1, the DUT processes the data traffic received over a single E2 connection.
After step 2, the DUT processes the data traffic received simultaneously over multiple E2 connections.
After step 3, the DUT discards the data and security event is logged with the logs fields as per clause 5.3.8.8 of [5].
After step 4, the DUT receives E2 traffic and handles it because E2 data is at, or below the pre-defined rate in DUT.
After step 5, the DUT discards the spilled over data and security events are logged with the log fields are as per clause 5.3.8.8 of [5] because the E2 data rate is higher than the pre-defined rate in DUT.
Expected format of evidence: Log files, traffic captures and/or report files.

Figure 24-9 shows the test setup and configuration.
Figure 24-9: Near-RT RIC A1 Vulnerability Assessment Test Setup
Execution steps
The tester uses a vulnerability scanning tool to scan the IP address of the Near-RT RIC A1 interface with the following parameters defined.
TCP Ports: Port scanner scans all TCP ports in range 0-65535 on the IP interface of SUT. TCP SYN/ACK response by SUT is interpreted as open port.
UDP Ports: All UDP ports documented in vendor-provided list. Other UDP ports may be considered as open for the purpose of service detection.
Safe Checks: Disabled (to make sure that exploitation attempts of the vulnerabilities will be performed)
NOTE:	Due to the nature of UDP protocol, there is no simple method of open port detection similar to TCP/SCTP methods based on analysis of response message type (TCP: SYN/ACK, SCTP: INIT-ACK). In case of UDP, open port detection relies on service detection which is discussed in step 2 of this test procedure. In practice, port scans of entire UDP port range 0-65535 are impractical and time consuming. Thus, service detection is generally performed only for subset of UDP ports. UDP port subset selection is arbitrary and not standardized. Service detection in this test procedure is required for UDP ports from vendor-provided list and is optional for other UDP ports.
Expected results
During the execution of the test, the degradation of service availability and performance of the SUT is not noticeable.

DUT is the Shared O-RU with:
IP enabled Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface, reachable from the authentication server
Valid certificate loaded for the server and necessary certificate authorities (CAs)
Client’s root CA required to validate NETCONF client certificate
Valid TLS Client-to-NETCONF username mapping
Execution steps
First set up a host/device with TLS client software installed, valid client certificates, keys, root CA certificate for the server (Shared O-RU), and all intermediate CA certificates required to validate the client certificate.
The following test steps are validated:
Start the NETCONF-over-TLS session using OpenSSL s_client command to connect with DUT using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3
Verify the session is established and mapped to the correct NETCONF user
Verify the global NACM enforcement control setting of
enable-nacm = true
read-default = permit
write-default = deny
exec-default = deny
enable-external-groups = true
Verify the NACM rule sets for the pre-defined groups
Close the NETCONF session and TLS connection
Upon availability of the NETCONF operations set(s) definition per NACM group, the NACM rule set(s) enforcement by the DUT is validated for each of those pre-defined groups listed above.
Expected results
The DUT supports NETCONF over TLS session over its Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface and NACM enforcement control settings.
Expected format of evidence: Log entries and packet captures.
TLS across Open Fronthaul
Requirement Name: Shared O-RU support for TLS 1.2, or higher, on the Open FH M-Plane interface with an O-RU controller
Requirement Reference: SEC-CTL-SharedORU-4, clause 5.1.9.2, O-RAN Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [5]

Reject Password-based authentication
Requirement Name: Denial of password-based authentication with an O-RU Controller by Shared O-RU
Requirement Reference: SEC-CTL-SharedORU-2, clause 5.1.9.2, O-RAN Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [5]
Requirement Description: Shared O-RU is able to reject password-based authentication on the Open Fronthaul M-Plane
Threat References: T-SharedORU-04
DUT/s: Shared O-RU
Test Name: TC_SharedORU_SSH_Password_Based_Authentication
Purpose: To verify the Shared O-RU can reject a SSH session using password-based authentication on the Open Fronthaul.
Procedure and execution steps
Preconditions
DUT is the Shared O-RU with password-based authentication for SSH on the Open Fronthaul disabled.
Execution steps
Enable SSH on the Open Fronthaul for the Shared O-RU. Ensure password-based authentication is not enabled on the Shared O-RU for SSH on the Open Fronthaul.
Configure the O-RU Controller as the SSH client with password-based authentication on the Open Fronthaul M-Plane.
Attempt to establish the Open Fronthaul M-Plane session between the Shared O-RU and O-RU Controller.
Expected results
The DUT rejects the Open Fronthaul M-Plane session with the O-RU Controller.
Expected format of evidence: Log entries, packet captures, and/or screenshots.
