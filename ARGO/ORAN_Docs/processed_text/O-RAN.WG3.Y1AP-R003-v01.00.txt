4	General
4.1	Introduction
The present document contains the stage-3 definitions for the services identified in Y1GAP [1]. Certain data types (e.g., the RAI data types) are defined in Y1TD [2].
One or more solution sets in terms of network protocol and data interchange format may be defined for each Y1 service API. The use of a specific solution set for a Y1 service API may be preconfigured or selected via appropriate means between the Near-RT RIC and the Y1 consumer.
4.2	Versioning of Y1 service APIs
4.2.1	General rules for API version
Each Y1 service API is versioned independently. An API version shall consist of at least 3 fields, following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern according to the Semantic Versioning Specification [i.2] unless specified otherwise.
EXAMPLE:	"1.0.0".
The basic rules as reproduced from [i.2] shall apply for incrementing the versions:
-	MAJOR version is incremented if backward incompatible change is made.
-	MINOR version is incremented if functional change is made in a backward compatible way.
-	PATCH version is incremented if correction is made in a backward compatible way.
4.2.2	Versioning for multiple solution sets of a Y1 service API
For a single Y1 service API in a release of this document, a single version should be kept across all the solution sets defined for that API. That means the different solution sets for a Y1 service API should evolve simultaneously.
4.2.3	Versioning for certain data types
The Y1 service APIs are designed in the approach that certain data types (e.g., the RAI data types) are decoupled from the APIs, and such data types may have versions independent from the API version. To that end, the full compatibility for a given solution set of a single Y1 service API between Near-RT RIC and Y1 consumer is jointly governed by the API version and the relevant data type version(s). Appropriate mechanisms should be applied to ensure compatibility.
5	Usage of solution sets
5.1	Introduction
For each solution set, the generic designs that are applicable in this specification are defined in this clause.
The solution sets may be used for a Y1 service API are listed in Table 5.1-1.
Table 5.1-1: Solution sets for Y1 interface
5.2	Usage of HTTP REST with JSON
5.2.1	General
The solution set of HTTP REST with JSON is introduced in clause 7.2 of Y1GAP [1].
The OpenAPI [3] specifications for each Y1 service API with this solution set are documented in Annex A.
5.2.2	Content type
The bodies of HTTP request and successful HTTP responses shall be encoded in JSON format. The MIME media type that shall be used within the related Content-Type header field is "application/json", as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [4], unless specified otherwise.
The "Problem Details" JSON object used to indicate additional details of the error in a HTTP response body shall be signaled by the content type "application/problem+json", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [5].
5.2.3	URI structure
5.2.3.1	Resource URI structure
The resource URIs of all Y1 service APIs, unless specified otherwise, shall be structured as:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>
with the following components:
-	The {apiRoot} indicates the scheme (e.g. "https"), the host name and optional port, and an optional implementation-specific sequence of path segments (starting with "/").
-	The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service API in an abbreviated form. It is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding Y1 service API.
-	The <apiMajorVersion> indicates the major version of the service API (see clause 4.2.1) and is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding Y1 service API.
-	Each <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> represents a specific resource of the service API. It is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding Y1 service API.
All resource URIs of the service APIs shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [6].
5.2.4	HTTP headers
5.2.4.1	General
The HTTP headers used in [7] are generally applicable to all Y1 service APIs with the solution set "HTTP REST with JSON" in the current release of document, unless specified otherwise.
5.2.5	Error handling
5.2.5.1	General
Unless specified otherwise, the HTTP error handling mechanism described in clause 5.2.6 of [7] is applicable to all Y1 service APIs with the solution set "HTTP REST with JSON" in the current release of document, with the following interpretations:
-	the SCEF is replaced by the Near-RT RIC; and
-	the SCS/AS is replaced by the Y1 consumer.
6	API Definitions
6.1	Introduction
The Y1 service APIs defined in this release of specification are listed in Table 6.1-1.
Table 6.1-1: List of Y1 Service APIs
6.2	Y1_RAI_Subscription API
6.2.1	Introduction
The Y1_RAI_ Subscription API is used to access the Y1_RAI_Subscription service.
The service operations and corresponding API definitions are organized in the following clauses for different solution sets.

6.2.2.1	Service operations
6.2.2.1.1	Introduction
Table 6.2.2.1.1-1 lists the operations supported by the Y1_RAI_Subscription service for the solution set "HTTP REST with JSON".
Table 6.2.2.2.1-1: Operations of the Y1_RAI_Subscription service
6.2.2.1.2	RAI_Subscribe service operation
6.2.2.1.2.1	General
The RAI_Subscribe service operation is used by a Y1 consumer to create or update a subscription for RAI notifications from the Near-RT RIC.
6.2.2.1.2.2		Subscribe to RAI notifications
Figure 6.2.2.1.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the Y1 consumer sends a request to the Near-RT RIC to create a subscription to RAI notifications. The operation is based on HTTP POST.
@startuml
participant "Y1 consumer" as cons
participant "Near-RT RIC" as prod
cons ->> prod: 1. POST .../subscriptions
prod ->> cons: 2. 201 Created
@enduml
Figure 6.2.2.1.2.2-1: Y1 consumer subscribes to notifications
The Y1 consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the Near-RT RIC with the Resource URL "{apiRoot}/Y1_RAI_Subscription/<apiMajorVersion>/subscriptions" representing the "All Y1 RAI Subscriptions" resource, to create an "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource according to the information in the message.
The "RaiSubscription" data structure provided in the request body shall include:
-	the type of RAI as the "raiType" attribute;
-	the version of the RAI type as the "raiTypeVersion" attribute;
-	the target entity/entities of the RAI in the "targetEntities" attribute;
-	an URI where to receive the RAI notifications as the "notificationTargetAddress" attribute;
-	the timing or the events when the RAI notifications are triggered in the "notificationCriteria" attribute, which shall include:
-	the method used to trigger RAI notifications as the "notificationMethod" attribute;
-	the time interval between periodic RAI notifications as the "notificationPeriod" attribute, if the "notificationMethod" attribute is set to "PERIODIC";

and may include:
-	the expected time of the first RAI notification as the "notificationStartTime" attribute, if the "notificationMethod" attribute is set to "PERIODIC".
The "RaiSubscription" data structure provided in the request body may include:
-	the expected validity period(s) for the RAI in the "expectedValidityPeriodsRelative" attribute; an expected validity period before the occurrence of a RAI notification refers to statistics for a past time, and an expected validity period after the occurrence of a RAI notification refers to a prediction for a future time.
-	the filter parameters to filter RAI contents in the RAI report as the "filterParameters" attribute;
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request, the Near-RT RIC shall create the subscription according to the request, assign a unique subscription ID as "subscriptionId", and store the record.
If the Near-RT RIC successfully creates an "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource, the Near-RT RIC shall respond with "201 Created" status code, with the message body containing a representation of the created subscription. The response shall include a "Location" HTTP header field which contains the URI of the created subscription, i.e., "{apiRoot}/Y1_RAI_Subscription/<apiMajorVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}".
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the Near-RT RIC shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.2.2.6. In particular,
-	If the necessary data to perform the analysis are unavailable, the Near-RT RIC shall reject the request with a "500 Internal Server Error" status code and a "ProblemDetails" data structure including the "cause" attribute set to "DATA_UNAVAILABLE".
6.2.2.1.2.3	Update subscription for RAI notifications
Figure 6.2.2.1.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the Y1 consumer sends a request to the Near-RT RIC to update a subscription to RAI notifications. The operation is based on HTTP PUT.
@startuml
participant "Y1 consumer" as cons
participant "Near-RT RIC" as prod
cons ->> prod: 1. PUT .../subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
prod ->> cons: 2a. "200 OK" or 2b. "204 No Content"
@enduml
Figure 6.2.2.1.2.3-1: Y1 consumer updates subscription to notifications
The Y1 consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request to the Near-RT RIC with the Resource URL "{apiRoot}/Y1_RAI_Subscription/<apiMajorVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}" representing the "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource, to update that resource identified by the "subscriptionId" field.
The "RaiSubscription" data structure provided in the request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 6.2.2.1.2.2.
Upon the reception of the HTTP PUT request, the Near-RT RIC shall update the subscription according to the request, and store the record.
If the Near-RT RIC successfully updates the "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource, the Near-RT RIC shall respond with:
-	a "200 OK" status code with the message body containing a representation of the updated subscription; or,
-	a "204 No Content" status code.
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP PUT request, the Near-RT RIC shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.2.2.6. In particular,
-	If the necessary data to perform the analysis are unavailable, the Near-RT RIC shall reject the request with a "500 Internal Server Error" status code and a "ProblemDetails" data structure including the "cause" attribute set to "DATA_UNAVAILABLE".
6.2.2.1.3	RAI_Unsubscribe service operation
6.2.2.1.3.1	General
The RAI_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an Y1 consumer to delete a subscription for RAI notifications.
6.2.2.1.3.2	Unsubscribe from RAI notifications
Figure 6.2.2.1.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the Y1 consumer sends a request to the Near-RT RIC to unsubscribe from RAI notifications. The operation is based on HTTP DELETE.
@startuml
participant "Y1 consumer" as cons
participant "Near-RT RIC" as prod
cons ->> prod: 1. DELETE .../subscriptions/{subscriptionId}
prod ->> cons: 2. 204 No Content
@enduml
Figure 6.2.2.1.3.2-1: Y1 consumer unsubscribes from notifications
The Y1 consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request to the Near-RT RIC with the resource URI "{apiRoot}/ Y1_RAI_Subscription/<apiMajorVersion>/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}" representing the "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource, to delete that resource identified by the "subscriptionId" field.
The message body shall be empty.
Upon the reception of the HTTP DELETE request, the Near-RT RIC shall remove the "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource according to the request.
If the Near-RT RIC successfully removes the "Individual Y1 RAI Subscription" resource, the Near-RT RIC shall respond with "204 No Content" status code.
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the Near-RT RIC shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.2.2.6.
6.2.2.1.4	RAI_Notify service operation
6.2.2.1.4.1	General
The RAI_Notify service operation is used by the Near-RT RIC to send RAI notifications to the Y1 consumer, or to terminate the subscription.
6.2.2.1.4.2	Notify subscribed RAI or termination of subscription
Figure 6.2.2.1.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the Near-RT RIC sends a request to the Y1 Consumer to send RAI notifications or to terminate the subscription. The operation is based on HTTP POST.
@startuml
participant "Y1 consumer" as prod
participant "Near-RT RIC" as cons
cons ->> prod: 1. POST{notificationTargetAddress}
prod ->> cons: 2. "204 No Content"
@enduml
Figure 6.2.2.1.4.2-1: Y1 consumer notifies the subscribed event
The Near-RT RIC shall send an HTTP POST request to the Y1 consumer with "{notificationTargetAddress}" as the resource URL.
The request shall be triggered according to the notification criteria as the "notificationCriteria" attribute in the subscription request, or when Near-RT RIC determines to terminate the subscription.
When the request is triggered by the notification criteria, the "RaiNotification" data structure provided in the request body shall include:
-	the subscription ID as the "subscriptionId" attribute;
-	the RAI reports in the "raiReports" attribute that, for each RAI report, the "RaiReport" data type shall include:

Figure 6.3.2.1.2.2-1: Y1 consumer query a RAI
The Y1 consumer shall send an HTTP GET request to the Near-RT RIC on the resource URI "{apiRoot}/Y1_RAI_Query/<apiMajorVersion>/analytics" representing the "Y1 RAI" resource, to request RAI. The following information shall be provided:
-	the type of RAI as the "raiType" attribute;
-	the version of the RAI type as the "raiTypeVersion" attribute;
-	the target entity/entities of the RAI in the "targetEntities" attribute.
The following information may be provided:
-	the expected validity period(s) for the RAI in the "expectedValidityPeriods" attribute; an expected validity period before the occurrence of a RAI query refers to statistics for a past time, and an expected validity period after the occurrence of a RAI query refers to a prediction for a future time.
-	the filter parameters to filter RAI contents in the RAI report as the "filterParameters" attribute;
Upon the reception of the HTTP GET request, the Near-RT RIC shall analyse RAI according to the request.
If the HTTP request message from the Y1 consumer is accepted, the Near-RT RIC shall respond with "200 OK" status code with the message body containing the RAI with parameters as relevant for the requesting Y1 consumer. The "raiQueryResult" data structure in the response body shall include:
-	the RAI reports in the "raiReports" attribute that, for each RAI report, the "RaiReport" data type shall include:
-	the target entity of the RAI report as the "targetEntity" attribute;
-	the validity period of the RAI report as the "validityPeriod" attribute;
-	the actual RAI contents as the "raiContents" attribute;
and may include:
-	the confidence of the RAI report, if the RAI report is a prediction;
-	the timestamp when Near-RT RIC generates the RAI report as the "timeStampRaiGeneration" attribute.
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the Near-RT RIC shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.2.2.6. In particular,
-	If the necessary data to perform the analysis are unavailable, the Near-RT RIC shall reject the request with a "500 Internal Server Error" status code and a "ProblemDetails" data structure including the "cause" attribute set to "DATA_UNAVAILABLE".
6.3.2.2	Resources
6.3.2.2.1	Resource URI structure
The resource URI shall have the structure as defined in clause 5.2.3.1 with the following clarifications:
