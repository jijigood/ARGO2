Conformance testing Near-RT RIC
General
Test configuration
The test configuration for E2 conformance testing of Near-RT RIC is illustrated in Figure 4.2.2-1 which shows a test setup that employs an E2 Node simulator, O-RU simulator, and UE simulator as a simplification.  A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of an O-RU with associated M-Plane support and also a real UE or test UE.
In as much as the conformance testing involves configuring the E2 Nodes and the Near- RT RIC, it shall be performed by means of the O1 interface. Configuration of the E2 Nodes and Near-RT RIC to operate in nominal state via the O1 interface and configuring for policy guidance and enrichment data to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface are outside
the scope of this test specification.
Figure - Illustration of Near-RT RIC E2 conformance test setup
Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrated Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node simulator may support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4.  Examples include:
-	Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and one or more standalone O-DU.   Each logical node is considered as an E2 Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.
-	Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components
-	Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  The combined node may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components
In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN components.The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC are bundled with some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the specification.
Bundle the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP
Bundle the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU
Device Under Test (Near-RT RIC)
For enabling conformance testing, the Near-RT RIC has implemented the E2 interface, and the procedures specified in “O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol” [2] that are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. It may also support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in “ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM” [5], “ORAN WG3: E2SM NI” [4] and “ORAN WG3: E2SM RC” [6] respectively.
The DUT, Near-RT RIC, may comply to only a subset of E2 procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to compliance claimed by a DUT are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 5.2.
Testing Tools
The E2 Node simulator simulates the E2 functionalities of the E2 Node side and have flexibility to generate, receive and validate messages for all the E2 global procedures and certain or all of the E2 service models. The test simulator logs all message content during the testing.
The test simulator has all the capabilities needed to operate the E2 test cases, including:
Generate E2 Node initiated procedures.
Receive Near-RT RIC initiated procedures.
Generate responses for either successful or unsuccessful operations with appropriate cause value in case of failure.
The test simulator should support all the RAN configurations discussed in clause 4.2.2, except those excluded in this version of the specification as described above.
The E2 Node simulator may also logically simulate the UE functions from the Near-RT RIC point of view, enabling meaningful cell and UE specific E2 services to run. Only the UE functions sufficient to facilitate the E2 interface focused conformance testing are simulated.
Conformance testing E2 Nodes
General
Test configuration
The test configuration for E2 conformance testing of different types of E2 Nodes are illustrated in Figure 4.3.2-1. The test setup employs a Near-RT RIC simulator, O-RU simulator, Core simulator and UE simulator as a simplification.  A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of real equipment. Configuring E2 Nodes to bring it to nominal operating state via the O1 is outside the scope of this test specification.
Figure -  Illustration of  E2-Node conformance test setup
Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node may support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4.  Examples include:
-	Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and one or more standalone O-DU.   Each logical node is considered as an E2 Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.
-	Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components
-	Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  The combined node may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components
In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC Simulator for each logical O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.
The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC is bundled with some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the specification.
Device Under Test (E2 Node)
The DUT could be of any E2 Node of the following type
O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP or O-DU
Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU
Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP
O-DU
O-eNB
For conformance testing the E2 Node has E2AP interface and implements procedures specified in “O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol” [2] that are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. It may support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in “ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM” [5], “ORAN WG3: E2SM NI” [4] and “ORAN WG3: E2SM RC” [6] respectively.
The DUT (E2 Node ) may comply to only a subset of E2AP procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to compliance claimed by a DUT are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 6.2.
Testing Tools
The Near-RT RIC simulator simulates the E2 functionalities of Near-RT RIC and has flexibility to generate, receive and validate messages for all the E2AP procedures and certain or all of the E2 service models. The test simulator logs all message contents during the testing.
The test simulator has all the capabilities needed to operate the E2 test cases, including:
Generate Near-RT RIC initiated procedures.
Receive E2 Node initiated procedures.
Generate responses for either successful or unsuccessful operations with appropriate cause value in case of failure.
The Test simulator (Near-RT RIC)  should support all the RAN configurations discussed in clause 4.3.2, except those excluded in this version of the specification as described above.
The test setup has the DUT (E2 Node) connect to other test equipment. These can be real or simulated UEs, RAN elements and Core (EPC or 5GC) to support scenarios appropriate for the E2 functionality being tested. An SMO with O1 interface is also included optionally if the E2 Node or any of real or simulated elements need configuration or operation to function.
Interoperability Testing between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node
General
FFS
Test configuration
The test configuration for interoperability testing between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node(s) is illustrated in figure 4.4.2-1 which shows a test setup that employs a Non-RT RIC simulator, Core Simulator, O-RU simulator, and UE simulator as a simplification. A test set-up without use of simulations would require inclusion of a real O-RU with associated M-Plane support and also a real UE or test UE.
In as much as the interoperability testing involves configuring the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node, it shall be performed by means of the O1 interface. Configuration of the Near-RT RIC and E2 Node to operate in nominal state via the O1 interface, and configuring for policy guidance and enrichment data to the Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface are outside the scope of this test specification.
Figure 4.4.2-1 Illustration of interoperability between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node test setup
Although the above test configuration diagrams illustrate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU as separate entities, the E2 Node may support a range of different RAN configurations similar to the list of cases described in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4.  Examples include:
-	Standalone O-CU-CP connected to one or more standalone O-CU-UP and one or more standalone O-DU.   Each logical node is considered as an E2 Node that presents an E2 interface to the Near-RT RIC.
-	Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP connected to one or more standalone O-DU. The combined O-CU-CP/O-CU-UP may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components
-	Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  The combined node may present either a common E2 interface or individual E2 interfaces corresponding to the individual O-RAN components
In all cases the different RAN components may initiate either independent E2 connections to the Near-RT RIC for each logical O-RAN component or may present a shared E2 interface and hence present the combined RAN components as a common E2 Node supporting services appropriate to more than one logical O-RAN component.
The following RAN configurations where the Near-RT RIC is bundled with some or all of the O-RAN nodes as discussed in “O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description” [8], Annex A.4, are not addressed in this version of the specification.
System Under Test (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node)
The System Under Test (SUT) consist of  Near-RT RIC and  E2 Node.
The E2 Node can be of any of the following type:
O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP or O-DU
Combined O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU
Combined O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP
O-DU
O-eNB
For enabling interoperability testing, the Near-RT RIC and E2 Node have implemented the E2 interface, and the procedures specified in “O-RAN WG3: E2 Application Protocol” [2] that are required to perform testing of the applicable test cases. They may also support all or a subset of the E2 service models - E2SM-KPM, E2SM-NI and E2SM-RC as specified in “ORAN WG3: E2SM KPM” [5], “ORAN WG3: E2SM NI” [4],  “ORAN WG3: E2SM RC” [6] and “ORAN WG3: E2SM CCC” [10] respectively.
Each element of the SUT, Near-RT RIC and E2 Node, may comply to only a subset of E2 procedures and E2 service models. Therefore, only those testcases that relate to procedures supported by both Near-RT and E2 Node are relevant. This is noted on a case-by-case basis in testcases defined in clause 7.
Testing Tools
The test setup has the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) connected to other test equipments. These can be real or simulated UEs, O-RU, RAN elements, Core (EPC or 5GC) and Non-RT RIC to support scenarios appropriate for the E2 functionality being tested. An SMO with O1 interface is also included optionally if the Near-RT RIC, E2 Node or any of real or simulated elements need configuration or operation to function.
In addition, a TAP interface can be used on E2 interface between Near-RT RIC and E2 Node to passively capture and analyze packets for test case validation. Alternatively, E2 logs from the SUT can be used for protocol analysis.

The RAN Function to which RIC subscribes and the RAN Function definition are predefined and shared between the elements of the SUT (Near RT RIC and E2 Node).). A Measurement Type as specified in [5] clause 8.3.9 is agreed to be included in the RIC Subscription. An example of the agreed RAN Function Definition IE defined in [5] clause 8.2.2.1 is shown in table below
Table 7.2.2.5.1-1 E2SM KPM Function Definition Profile IE profile
The SUT has functionality to trigger RIC Subscription Delete procedure
Test Methodology
Initial conditions
The elements of the SUT (Near-RT RIC and E2 Node) are connected by E2 interface
E2 Setup procedure is successfully completed in the SUT with the agreed RAN Function Definition IE
RIC Subscription procedure is successfully completed in the SUT with the agreed RIC Request ID and RAN Function ID
Procedure
Step 1. Enable the protocol analyzer to capture, record and decode the E2 signalling between SUT elements via the TAP interface.
Step 2. Perform the RIC Subscription Delete procedure
An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.
Initiate appropriate action or configuration in the SUT to trigger the RIC Subscription Delete procedure
Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUEST message to the E2 Node, with the agreed RIC Request ID and RAN Function ID
E2 Node sends RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE to the Near-RT RIC with the agreed RIC Request ID and RAN Function ID
Step 3. The test is ended after the test duration defined in test entrance criteria, allowing the E2 Node to cover several Reporting periods after the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE message is received
Expected results
The test is considered passed if
All messages are correctly decoded by the protocol analyser
E2 logs recorded in the protocol analyzer are aligned with successful operation message flows specified in [2] clause 8.2.2.
RIC Subscription Delete procedure is successful and it is validated in recorded E2 logs that
- RAN Function ID IE corresponds to the agreed RAN Function (during E2 Setup procedure and RIC Subscription procedure) in both RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUEST and RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE messages
- RIC REQUEST ID IE is the same as that in RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST, RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE and RIC INDICATION messages
- RIC REQUEST ID IE corresponds to the agreed RIC Request ID (during RIC Subscription procedure) in both the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE REQUEST and RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE RESPONSE messages
No RIC Indication messages are sent for the agreed RAN Function ID and RIC Request ID after the E2 Node sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE message
If an Error Indication procedure is triggered during the test, then the test result shall be determined as failed.
If RIC SUBSCRIPTION DELETE FAILURE message is sent by E2 Node, then the test result shall be determined as failed.
