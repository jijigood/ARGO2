4 Application protocol for TE&IV services 
4.1 Introduction  
The present document contains a realization of the services identified in TE&IV UCR [1]. This definition of the TE&IV 
Application Protocols Interface (TE&IV API) defined in the present document is based on the 3GPP service framework for 
network functions specified in 3GPP TS 29.501 [3]. 
4.2 Version conventions for the present document 
The version number of the present document follows the "xx.yy " versioning scheme. There could be implications for the 
interoperability between TE&IV Service Consumers and TE&IV Service API implementations in the SMO that are based on 
different versions of the present document. 
An incremented "xx" version field of the present document could indicate that a new major feature (e.g., a new TE&IV 
Service) has been added or that an incompatible change has been made to one or more TE&IV Service APIs. An incremented 
"yy" version field could indicate that an optional feature has been added, a technical issue has been fixed, or that clarific ations 
or editorial corrections have been made. 
The version conventions for RESTful TE&IV Service APIs are defined in clause 5.2. 
 
5 RESTful TE&IV Service APIs 
5.1 Overview  
The design of the RESTful TE&IV Service APIs is based on the services and requirements defined in TE&IV UCR [1], and on 
the protocol design framework as specified in 3GPP TS 29.501 [3].  

 
 
 
© 2025 by the O-RAN ALLIANCE e.V. Your use is subject to the copyright statement on the cover page of this specification. 6 
 
O-RAN.WG10.TS.TE&IV-API.0-R004-v03.00 
The present document defines the protocols for the TE&IV service APIs listed in table 5.1-1. 
Table 5.1-1: RESTful TE&IV Service APIs and their versions defined in the present document.  
Service API API version 
Topology & Inventory API 1.0.0 
5.2 Versioning of RESTful TE&IV Service APIs 
Each RESTful TE&IV Service API is versioned independently. The API version number defined in the present document 
contains three numerical fields following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern, and may contain a pre -release version field, 
according to SemVer [4].   
The API version number held by an implementation may additionally include a build metadata field, according to SemVer [4], 
to indicate a specific deployment. The content of this field is implementation specific; it is provided by the deployment. The 
<apiVersion> path segment used in URI structures indicate the MAJOR field of the API version number . The full API version 
number is visible in the "version" field of the "info" object of each OpenAPI document in Annex A . 
To indicate the full API version the API Consumer intends to use, the API Consumer may include the "Version" HTTP header 
(see IETF RFC 4229 [i.1]) in an HTTP request, in which case the header shall contain the version identifier as defined above. 
It is optional to include the build metadata field. 
The API Producer shall include in the response the "Version" HTTP header signalling the used API version, including the 
build metadata if available. If the build metadata have been omitted in the request, the API Producer shall use the combinati on 
of MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH, and pre-release indicator as requested and the highest supported value for the build metadata 
field for that combination, if available. In case the API Consumer has not sent a "Version" header in the request, the API 
Producer shall use the latest available version, and signal it in the "Version" header. 
NOTE: In case multiple versions are supported by an API Producer under the URI for a major version, this allows the 
API Consumer to request a particular version. This mechanism is referred to as "microversioning".  
If the API version signalled by the API Consumer in the "Version" request header is not supported by the API Producer, the 
API Producer shall respond with a "406 Not Acceptable" error and may include in the response payload body a Problem 
Details structure providing more information on the cause of the error. 
5.3 URI structure and supported content formats  
This clause specifies the URI prefix and the supported content formats applicable to the RESTful TE&IV Service APIs. 
All resource URIs of the APIs shall have the following prefix:  
 {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/ 
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API Consumer towards the API Producer shall have the resource URI 
structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [3], i.e.: 
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart> 
with the following components: 
- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [3]; however,  the restrictions w.r.t the 
operator specific FQDN of the host portion defined there do not apply.  
- The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. It is defined in the 
clause specifying the corresponding RESTful TE&IV Service API. 
- The <apiVersion> indicates the major version (see clause 5.2) of the API and is defined in the clause specifying the 
corresponding RESTful TE&IV ServiceAPI. 
- Each <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> represents a specific resource of the API. It is defined in the corresponding 
RESTful TE&IV Service API for each one of the defined resources.

O-RAN.WG10.TS.TE&IV-API.0-R004-v03.00 
For HTTP requests and responses that have message content, the content format JSON shall be supported (see IETF RFC 8259  
[5]). The JSON content shall be signalled by the content type "application/json" and for JSON encoded YANG, the content 
type “application/yang.data+json” shall be used (see IETF RFC 7951 [8]). 
All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [6]. An implementation that 
dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of path segments that are separated by "/", 
query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the character set that is allowed by IETF RFC 3986 [6] for these 
parts.  
 
5.4 General considerations for RESTful TE&IV Service APIs   
5.4.1 Usage of HTTP header fields  
HTTP headers are components of the headers section of the HTTP request and response messages. The usage of HTTP header 
fields shall follow the definitions in clause 4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [7].  
5.4.2 Handling of large query results 
The handling of large query results shall be supported by RESTful TE&IV Service APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2 of ETSI 
GS NFV-SOL 013 [7]. 
5.4.3 Error reporting 
In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is generally not enough to 
discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error information is typically delivered in the message  
content based on the ProblemDetails data type. 
HTTP error responses shall be supported as specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [3]. Protocol errors and application errors 
specified in table  5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP  TS 29.500 [2] shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status 
codes are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [2]. 
If an HTTP method is not defined for a particular resource in the present document, that method is not supported.  When that 
method is requested on the resource, the API Producer shall return a "405 Method Not Allowed" response. The message content 
may include a ProblemDetails structure. 
6 Topology Exposure and Inventory Management Services  
6.1 Topology Inventory API 
6.1.1 Introduction 
This API enables the API Consumer to query the topology entities, entity types and its relationship to other topology entities as 
defined in TE&IV CIMI [9].  
6.1.2 API version  
For the Topology Inventory API as specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be 1, the MINOR version 
field shall be 0 and the PATCH version field shall be 0 (see clause 4.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [3] for a definition of the version 
fields). Consequently, the <apiVersion> URI path segment shall be set to “v1“.

O-RAN.WG10.TS.TE&IV-API.0-R004-v03.00 
6.1.3 Resource structure and methods 
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API Consumer towards the API Producer shall have the resource URI structure 
as defined in clause 5.2. The <apiName> resource URI variable shall be “topology-inventory”. The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> 
for each resource shall be set as described in clause 6.1.5. 
Figure 6.1.3-1 shows the overall resource URI structure defined for the Topology Inventory API.

OpenAPI Specifications 
A.1 Overview 
This Annex formally specifies the RESTful Topology & Inventory API by defining OpenAPI documents in YAML format that 
comply with the OpenAPI 3.0.3 Specification [11]. 
The Open API specifications of the RESTful Topology & Inventory API provided in this annex are versioned as described in 
clause 5.2.

    API for Topology and Inventory API. 
 
    Topology and Inventory data is the information that represents entities 
    in a telecommunications network and the relationships between them that 
    provide insight into a particular aspect of the network of importance to 
    specific use cases. Topology and Inventory data can be derived from 
    inventory, configuration, or other data. 
 
    Topology and Inventory supports several topology domains. A domain is a 
    grouping of topology and inventory entities that handles topology and 
    inventory data. 
 
    Entities are enabling the modelling and storage of complex network 
    infrastructure and relationships. 
 
    A relationship is a bi-directional connection between two entities, one

    of which is the originating side (A-side) and the other is the 
    terminating side (B-side). The order of the sides matters since it 
    defines the relationship itself which must be unique. 
 
    Classifier (also known as tag or label) permits the association of a 
    well defined user specified string with an entity or relationship. 
 
    Decorators are user-defined attributes (key-value pairs) which can 
    be applied to topology entities and relationships. 
 
    Topology and Inventory API provides the capabilities to fetch topology 
    data. Using the filtering options, it is possible to define more specific 
    query requests.
