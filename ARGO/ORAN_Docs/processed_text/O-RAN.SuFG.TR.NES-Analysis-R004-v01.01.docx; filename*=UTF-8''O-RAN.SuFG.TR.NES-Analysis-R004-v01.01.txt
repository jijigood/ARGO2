Introduction

Open RAN energy management is a key sustainability objective shared by mobile operators worldwide, aiming to scale Open RAN technology for commercial deployments and expedite its development. As part of broader industry goals, leading operators have highlighted energy efficiency as critical to Open RAN’s success, underscoring their commitment to advancing sustainable telecommunications infrastructure. To achieve meaningful energy savings, while ensuring reliable performance, the telecom industry requires a standardized approach not only to save energy but also to evaluate, test, measure, and monitor energy consumption in Open RAN deployments. This Technical Report (TR) analyzes operator requirements related to energy consumption measurements and energy efficiency KPIs and identifies gaps within O-RAN ALLIANCE specifications to align with these industry-wide priorities

1	Scope

The present document provides a technical analysis report aimed at identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the definitions of energy consumption measurements and energy efficiency KPIs across O-RAN ALLIANCE specifications, current MoU Release Operator Requirements, and relevant Standard Development Organizations (SDOs), primarily 3GPP and ETSI. Its objective is to harmonize the reporting of energy consumption KPIs and to enable the calculation of consistent and comparable energy efficiency KPIs.

4	Objectives and analysis approach

4.1	Objectives

This Technical Report presents the outcomes of the SuFG TG2 Energy Measurement analysis phase, with objectives in the pre-normative phase outlined as follows:

This report evaluates O-RAN ALLIANCE specifications and energy consumption measurement standards to align with industry KPIs, ensuring consistency with operator-specific KPIs that address real-world expectations and requirements from 3GPP and ETSI standards.

The report identifies key gaps and areas for improvement in current O-RAN ALLIANCE specifications, focusing on the need for actionable and practical energy measurement and KPI enhancements. These improvements aim to provide a robust foundation for standardized reporting, ensuring compatibility with industry-wide frameworks and operational needs.

The goal is to propose new measurement approaches and configuration parameters where necessary, addressing identified gaps while maintaining alignment with industry best practices and priorities.

4.2 	Approach followed

O-RAN SuFG conducted an analysis of the Open RAN Technical Priority Documents, which were published by the Open RAN MoU Group at TIP in March 2023 [i.2]. These documents, developed as part of the memorandum signed by Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefónica, TIM, and Vodafone, outline key operator expectations for O-RAN technology. SuFG focused its analysis on energy consumption measurements and energy efficiency KPIs, identifying gaps in the existing O-RAN specifications and providing recommendations for future enhancements within the O-RAN ALLIANCE.

The methodology of this Technical Report includes:

Current Standard Analysis: Examines foundational requirements against O-RAN, 3GPP, and ETSI specifications.

Gap Analysis: Identifies and documents gaps between these requirements and the specifications.

Recommendations: Provides informed recommendations aimed at improving future NES work items in O-RAN, based on the analysis.

5			O-Cloud Energy Measurements

5.1			Foundational Requirements for O-Cloud

5.1.1	Energy consumption KPIs at hardware level

5.1.1.1	Description

The O-Cloud platform to provide power, energy, and environmental (PEE) metrics for all hardware components, including CPU, NIC, and Accelerator card, reporting energy consumption via the O2 interface to the SMO, or through a proprietary NBI interface to external tools until O2 specifications are available.

Reference MOU “rel2_CaaS_123”

5.1.1.2	Current Standard Analysis

5.1.1.2.1		O-RAN ALLIANCE references

WG1 has identified a similar requirement in their Network Energy Saving Use Cases Technical Report but does not provide any further analysis in that report, see clause 4.2 of O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3].

WG6 has specified a generic Performance Management framework in the Technical Specification for O2 Interface General Aspects and Principles that supports PM reporting of O-Cloud resources to SMO, see clause 3.9 of O-Cloud Performance Basic Concepts of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P-R003-v06.00 [i.4].

The ongoing Study on O-Cloud Energy Savings, now in version O-RAN.WG6.O-Cloud ES-v02.00 [i.5], provides a comprehensive analysis of power and energy consumption metrics at the infrastructure level in clause 6.

The ES technical report [i.3] have identified several KPIs and measurement methodologies for power/energy consumption, and efficiency at various levels within the O-Cloud infrastructure.

O-Cloud Resource Power Consumption Metrics: These metrics include PowerCapacity, PowerConsumed, AveragePowerConsumed, MaxPowerConsumed, and MinPowerConsumed. These measurements apply to relevant O-Cloud resources, capturing the power dynamics over a specified interval.

O-Cloud Node Energy Consumption Metrics: New metrics such as ECnode,core (total energy consumption of CPU cores), ECnode,uncore (uncore components like caches and memory controllers), ECnode,dram (DRAM energy), and others are introduced to monitor energy consumption across different components of the O-Cloud nodes.

Container Energy Consumption: WG6 introduces metrics at the container level, such as ECcontainer, total (total energy consumption within a container), ECcontainer,core (energy used by CPU cores within a container), and other relevant metrics to track energy usage at the container level.

Figure 5.1.1.2-2 – Excerpt from O-Cloud Node Power Consumption Metrics [i.3]

5.1.1.2.2		3GPP and ETSI references

3GPP TS 28.552 v18.5.0 [i.6] clause 5.1.1.19 specifies following PEE (Power Energy & Environmental) related measurements for a 5G Physical Network Function (PNF):

Table 5.1.1.2.2-1: PEE Measurements [i.6]

Attribute

Description

PEE.AvgPower

This measurement provides the average power consumed over the measurement period in watts (W)

PEE.MinPower

This measurement provides the minimum power consumed during the measurement period in watts (W)

PEE.MaxPower

This measurement provides the maximum power consumed during the measurement period in watts (W)

PEE.Energy

This measurement provides the energy consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

PEE.AvgTemperature

This measurement provides the average temperature over the measurement period in degrees Celsius (°C).

PEE.MinTemperature

This measurement provides the minimum temperature during the measurement period in degrees Celsius (°C).

PEE.MaxTemperature

maximum This measurement provides the temperature during the measurement period in degrees Celsius (°C).

PEE.Voltage

This measurement provides the voltage in volts (V)

PEE.Current

This measurement provides the current in ampere (A)

PEE.Humidity

This measurement provides the percentage of humidity during the measurement period (as integer value between 0-100)

For the measurement methods of each of the above measurements, the 3GPP TS references the respective clause in ETSI ES 202 336-12 v1.2.1 [i.8]. The equipment in scope of ETSI ES 202 336-12 v1.2.1 [i.8]is not limited to 3GPP 5G PNFs, but has a broader scope, i.e., all types of ICT equipment that is used in telecommunications networks, see Table 1 in clause 4.4.1 of ETSI ES 202 336-12 v1.2.1 [i.8].

5.1.1.3	Gap Analysis

Looking at the MoU requirement and the standards references above, SuFG TG2 interprets “rel2_CaaS_123” as requirement for providing power, energy and environmental (PEE) parameters and measurement data for O-RAN resources to SMO in a similar way as specified by 3GPP TS 28.552 [i.6] for PNFs. As O-CU and O-DU are not necessarily PNFs but can be implemented as virtualized NFs (VNFs/CNFs) running in O-Cloud, the O-Cloud will need the capability to collect PEE measurements of all relevant physical components of O-Cloud, and to provide these as PM data to SMO, similar to the PEE measurements provided by O-RU (as already specified by relevant WGs).

WG6 has already specified a generic framework for PM reporting and is currently working on stage 3 specifications for O2 PM. In the ongoing study on O-Cloud Energy Savings WG6 has provided an initial analysis for power and energy consumption metrics of infrastructure

SuFG TG2 identified following gaps:

WG6 has not defined a data model for O2 PM measurements. Currently, only a framework exists for transporting supplier-proprietary data elements, which are specified within supplier-specific dictionaries.

Discussions within WG6 have revealed differing opinions regarding the exposure of hardware and component-level measurements to the SMO, resulting in a lack of consensus on this issue.

The O-RAN ALLIANCE has not yet established a clear definition or framework for measuring hardware energy efficiency, such as computing performance per watt (Compute/Watt).

It is important to note that all current work in WG6 is still at the study level, and there have been no normative discussions on power or energy measurements thus far.

Reference MOU “rel2_CaaS_124”

5.1.2.2	Current Standard Analysis

5.1.2.2.1		O-RAN ALLIANCE references

WG1 has identified a similar requirement in their Network Energy Saving Use Cases Technical Report but does not provide any further analysis in that report, see clause 4.2 of O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3].

WG6 has specified a generic Performance Management framework in the Technical Specification for O2 Interface General Aspects and Principles that supports PM reporting of O-Cloud resources to SMO.

WG6 defined power and energy consumption metrics at the workload level within the O-Cloud in Energy Savings Technical Report (O-RAN.WG6.O-Cloud ES-v02.00 [i.5]). Specifically, clauses 6.3 and 6.4 outline metrics for containers, NF deployments, and Cloudified NFs. These include energy consumption metrics such as ECcontainer,total, ECcontainer,core, and ECNF Deployment, estimated, which allow for detailed monitoring and analysis of energy consumption at various levels of the O-Cloud infrastructure. WG6 has also highlighted the importance of these metrics in assessing the performance of energy efficiency strategies and making necessary policy adjustments. power and energy consumption metrics [i.5] (Table 5.1.2.2.1-1):

Figure 5.1.1.2-3 - Excerpt from O-Cloud NF Deployment Energy Metrics [i.5]

Figure 5.1.1.2-4 - Excerpt from O-Cloud Cloudified NF Energy Efficiency [i.5]

5.1.2.2.2		3GPP and ETSI references

Relevant 3GPP and ETSI references are covered by the WG6 TR, these are ETSI GR NFV-EVE 021 [i.7] and clause 6.7.3.1.4 of 3GPP TS 28.554 [i.9].

ETSI NFV EVE (authoring WG of ETSI GR NFV-EVE 021 [i.7] and 3GPP SA5 (responsible WG for 3GPP TS 28.554 [i.9]) had an LS exchange about "5G network energy efficiency and energy saving", that highlight results of ETSI NFV EVE informative work in ETSI GR NFV-EVE 021 [i.7].

Based on the LS from ETSI NFV EVE to 3GPP SA5, SuFG TG2 expects that ETSI NFV will provide normative specifications to derive actual VNF/CNF power consumption by collecting relevant metrics about power consumption of underlying virtualized resources without having to rely on estimated values based on other metrics. Their intention is to make extensible the functionality to collect power consumption for any kind of NFVI resources, if feasible. 3GPP SA5 can then take this normative work as basis to update their TS 28.554 [i.9].

5.1.2.3	Gap Analysis

	Observations related to WG6:

As mentioned in 5.1.1.3 WG has yet to establish a mechanism for reporting of PM data in a standardized, Interoperable manner.

Furthermore, WG6 will need to work out a detailed flow about how power and energy consumption metrics of NF deployment and cloudified NFs is derived and made available for SMO; respective specifications updates will need to be made.

The following SMO requirement is also connected to this topic:

MoU Requirement rel_2_SMO_116 [i.2]: “Dashboards for power consumption of clusters should be available in SMO (power consumption by worker, by switch, by FAN, by HW acceleration, by site, by data center, by CaaS, PaaS, tools). Operator should be able to export all dashboard manually or automatically”

MoU Requirement rel_2_SMO_118 [i.2]: “Power consumption metrics/KPI/counters/logs of CNFs should be available on SMO per NF type and per NF instance to allow automated load consolidation.”

5.1.3.2	Current Standard Analysis

5.1.3.2.1		O-RAN ALLIANCE references

In the ongoing Study [i.5] , WG6 has identified the relevant energy efficiency KPIs in clause 6.4, also including the relevant 3GPP and ETSI references:

“The approach for assessing energy efficiency of Cloudified NF strongly depends on the functionality and purpose of the Cloudified NF. In general, the energy efficiency of a Cloudified NF can be determined by assessing its delivered performance versus its energy consumption over a defined time interval following formula:

Wherein  corresponds to the service p

NOTE: “Further information on how these KPIs is calculated are available in the relevant 3GPP and ETSI specifications. Selection of a particular way of measuring the energy efficiency depends on the requirements, type of deployments and use-cases. It is expected that the SMO can compute the Energy consumption and efficiency of a Cloudified NF based on measurements from the O-Cloud. Energy efficiency calculations may involve collaboration with other working groups, such as WG10.”

WG6 specifications for O2 general aspects and principles (see clause 3.9 of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P-R003-v06.00 [i.4] and use-cases and requirements (see clasue 3.8 of O-RAN-WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES-R003-v09.00 [i.12]) for PM are available. These enable SMO to interact with PM services to receive measurement reports and to perform PM jobs related interations, e.g. request for, subsribe to, update, PM jobs

Stage 3 for O-Cloud PM for O2 interface is expected to be covered in the future releases.

WG1studied decoupling of SMO Services (SMOS) offered by different SMO Functions in O-RAN-WG1. Decoupled-SMO-Architecture-R003-v02.00 [i.22]. In clause 5.1.1 the RAN NF Performance Assurance Management SMO Service (NFPM) is discussed. It describes the NFPM SMOS that provides a mechanism for the NFPM SMOS consumers to create and terminate the PM job as well as querying the related PM information by consuming PM MnS via O1 interface and Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface. This enables a NFPM SMOS consumers to collect PM measurements as defined in 3GPP TS 28.552 [i.6], like DL PDCP SDU Data Volume per interface in clause 5.1.3.6.2.3, UL PDCP SDU Data Volume per interface in clause 5.1.3.6.2.4, PNF Energy consumption in clause 5.1.1.19.3 or Power consumed by Physical Network Function & its components in clause 5.1.1.19.2.

Generic mechanisms for O1 PM are already standardized, see O-RAN.WG1.O1-Interface.0-v04.00 [i.19] clause 2.3 Performance Assurance Management Services and O-RAN.WG10.OAM-Architecture-R003-v11.00 [i.20] clause4.2.2 O-RAN Measurement Data Collection Use Case.

5.1.3.2.2	3GPP and ETSI references

In addition to the 3GPP and ETSI references above, it is relevant to look at the 3GPP specifications for the OA&M collection method, which are 3GPP TS 28.550 [i.14] and 3GPP TS 28.532 [i.15]. 3GPP defines one set of generic procedures for all types of PM measurements and KPIs that are specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 [i.6] and TS 28.554 [i.9].

5.1.3.3	Gap Analysis

Looking at the MoU requirement and the standards references above, SuFG TG2 interprets “rel2_CaaS_123” as requirement towards O2 PM services, i.e. to enable a management service within SMO to control requests and collection of sufficient energy/power measurements in a way that allows it to synchronise these PM measurements with relevant performance PM measurements from E2 Nodes over the respective interfaces so that management service within SMO can calculate meaningful EC and EE KPIs.

The following SMO requirement is also connected to this topic:

Energy Saving features

To improve energy efficiency, it's crucial to examine how measurements from the O-RU can be used and what types are needed for various energy-saving features. The current O-RAN specifications don't define the necessary energy measurements for these features in the O-RU. The following details are from the WG1 O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 technical report on O-RU rules for different energy-saving features:

O-RU Specific KPIs: Energy Efficiency and power consumption KPIs provided by real-time metering.

Energy Saving Feature

O-RU Roles

Carrier and Cell Switch Off/On

O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3] Clause 5.2.2.2 and 5.2.2.3.1

a) Report EC and EE related information via Open FH M-Plane interface to O-DU or alternatively to SMO directly.

b) Support actions required to perform EE/ES optimization. updated carrier configuration (i.e. activation, deactivation or sleep)

c) Input data: Power consumption metrics: Mean total/per carrier power consumption, mean total/per carrier transmit power

RF Channel Reconfiguration

O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3] Clause 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3.1

a) Report EC and EE related information over Open FH M-Plane to O-DU or alternatively to SMO directly.

b) Perform actions required to be performed due to RF Channel Reconfiguration (i.e., O-RU Tx/Rx Array selection, modification of the number of SSB beams, modification of the O-RU Antenna Transmit power, modification of the number of SU/MU MIMO spatial streams or data layers) as part of EE/ES optimization.

c) Input: Power consumption metrics: Mean total/per carrier power consumption, mean total/per carrier transmit power.

Information on supported Tx/Rx Array selections along with power consumption (site/O-RU input power needed for certain EE KPIs)

Advanced Sleep Mode Selection

O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3] Clause 7.2.1.2

a) Support reporting the O-RU SMs capabilities and additional operational parameters to O-DU via O-FH.

b) Internally apply SM selection or alternatively receive over O-FH and apply O-DUs request for updated SM configuration (e.g., switch off a certain O-RU functionality).

c) Input: missing from the TR

WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 TR [i.3] is referencing the 3GPP TS 28.552 [i.6], clause.5.1.1.19.2 and O-RAN.WG4.MP [i.10] (Clause B.1 and B.5) in relation to the energy measurements.

Shared O-RU Scenario

The O-RU energy efficiency could also be beneficial in a Multi-Operator Operation scenario. Based on the technical specification O-RAN.WG4.MP.0-R004-v15.00 [i.10], clause 19, O-FH shall support the multi-operator scenario:

“Shared O-RU performance management

The NETCONF client of a Shared Resource Operator is identified by using a user list entry in o-ran-usermgmt YANG model that contains a configured sro-id. Such a NETCONF client shall have restricted access privileges to the o-ran-performance-management YANG model as described in sub-clause O-RAN.WG4.MP.0-R004-v15.00 [i.10],  19.3.3. An O-RU supporting the SHARED-ORU-MULTI-OPERATOR feature should support the GRANULARITY-TRANSPORT-MEASUREMENT and/or the GRANULARITY-EAXC-ID-MEASUREMENT features. These allow the O-RU to report rx-window-measurement-objects on a per ru-element and/or eaxcid basis, meaning window measurements pertain to the transport flows and/or eaxcids associated with a particular Shared Resource Operator. A Shared O-RU Host can configure multiple remote-file-uploads list entries corresponding to the individual file servers of different Shared Resource Operators. However, there is currently no role-based access control applied to file management-based performance management reporting, as specified in clause [i.10] 10.3.2. If access to configured measurement results needs to be controlled on a per Shared Resource Operator basis, file management-based performance management should not be used.”

Based on the comparison above in EPE-STATS, the energy consumption (kWh) and humidity counter are missing.

In defining EPE-STAT, it was not clearly specified which hardware components need to transmit these data. Based on the O-RAN.WG7.OMAC-HRD.0-R003-v03.00 [i.11] specification, multiple O-RU hardware components were identified.

The O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3] technical report describes the energy-saving features for O-RAN, along with the equipment roles and requirements of the equipment involved. The features such as Carrier and Cell Switch Off/On and RF Channel Reconfiguration energy-saving require power consumption metrics, including mean total power consumption/per carrier, as well as the mean total transmit power/per carrier. Measuring power consumption per carrier may require multiple sensors or additional calculations; refer to the following requirement for more details.

The technical report also discusses the Advanced Sleep Mode Selection energy-saving feature, which does not rely on any input counters or metrics from the O-RU. In this scenario, it is unclear which counters are required or how power consumption could be measured across different sleep mode types.

Advanced sleep mode with M-PLANE OFF

Advanced sleep mode with M-PLANE OFF, also known as Deep-Hibernate sleep mode, please refer to clause 20.5 of O-RAN.WG4.MP.0-R004-v15.00 [i.10]

In a multi-operator scenario, it would be beneficial to measure or calculate the energy consumption for each operator. The current specification only requires the rx-window-measurement-objects.

Title

Description

Motivation

SuFG-to-WG4-REC-001

O-RU Per Carrier Power consumption

O-RU Power Efficiency in Multi-Band Operations Power efficiency metrics should be available for each frequency band in multi-band O-RUs, reporting the efficiency of each band's energy consumption.

Facilitates fine-tuned energy optimization by assessing and adjusting power usage for each active frequency band.

SuFG-to-WG4-REC-002

O-RU energy consumption.

PEE.Energy (kWh)

Total energy consumed by the O-RU during specific measurement period

Its part of ETSI ES 202 336-12 v1.2.1 [i.8], however not included in O-RAN WG4 EPE-STAT.

SuFG-to-WG4-REC-003

O-RU Energy consumption during M-Plane off (Deep Hibernate)

The O-RU should report its energy consumption for the period when it was in deep hibernate mode after the M-Plane connection is re-established.

When the M-Plane is off, the O-RU cannot report real-time energy consumption data, making it difficult for operators to monitor energy usage during hibernation. By providing energy consumption data after re-establishing the M-Plane, operators can accurately assess energy savings and manage consumption during deep hibernate periods..

SuFG-to-WG4-REC-004

O-RU Real-Time Power Monitoring

Real-time power consumption metrics should be accessible from the O-RU to monitor transient power changes dynamically

Enables continuous tracking of power fluctuations, supporting immediate adjustments in energy management strategies, especially valuable in high-demand or multi-tenant deployments.

SuFG-to-WG4-REC-005

O-RU Power Consumption per Antenna Array

Detailed power consumption metrics for each antenna array in MIMO configurations within the O-RU.

Supports energy optimization in MIMO setups by enabling power adjustments for individual antenna arrays based on demand and usage patterns

7.1			Foundational requirements for O-CU / O-DU

7.1.1 	O-DU & O-CU Energy measurements reporting

7.1.1.1	Description

 O-CU and O-DU to provide CNF level energy efficiency counters / KPIs (e.g. Traffic load / data volume / throughput), which is to be reported through O1 interface to the SMO or through NBI to external tooling.

Reference (MoU Requirement “rel_2_O-CU_O-DU_66”)

7.1.1.2	Current Standard Analysis

7.1.1.2.1		O-RAN ALLIANCE references

WG1 has identified a similar requirement in their Network Energy Saving Use Cases Technical Report O-RAN.WG1.NESUC-R003-v02.00 [i.3].

WG2 is using O-CU/O-DU EC measurements in Non-RT RIC & A1/R1 interface: Use Cases and Requirements, see clause 4.8 in O-RAN.WG2.Use-Case-Requirements-R003-v09.00 [i.23] but only for O-CU/O-DU deployed as PNF.

In the ongoing Study on O-Cloud Energy Savings (current draft version O-RAN.WG6.O-Cloud Energy Savings.v00.00.07[i.5], WG6 has stated the following in clause 6.4:

“It is expected that the SMO can compute the Energy consumption and efficiency of a Cloudified NF based on measurements from the O-Cloud”

7.1.1.2.2		3GPP and ETSI reference

Refer to Clause 5.2.2 in the document.

7.1.1.3	Gap Analysis

The O-CU and O-DU can exist as Cloudified NFs, or Physical NFs and energy consumption metrics should be available in SMO for both deployment options.

When the O-CU and O-DU are deployed as PNFs, the reporting of energy consumption by both will be via the O1 interface to the SMO.

When the O-CU and O-DU are deployed as VNFs/CNFs, the reporting of energy consumption of O-Cloud resources should be via the O2 interface and a management function in SMO would need to determine energy consumption for the O-CU and O-DU NF deployment. The issue has not yet been addressed.

Additionally, the same references apply as described in clause 5.1.3.2.2.

8.1.1.3		Gap Analysis

Looking at the MoU requirement and the standards references above, SuFG TG2 identified following gaps:

Missing specification of SMOS for collecting relevant PM measurements (as defined in 3GPP TS 28.552 [i.6])

Missing specification of SMOS for calculating EE KPIs as defined in 3GPP TS 28.554 [i.9]. clause 6.7.1 NG-RAN data Energy Efficiency (EE) for PNFs

Missing specification of SMOS for

collecting relevant PM measurements of O-Cloud resources via the O2 interface

determining energy consumption for the O-CU and O-DU VNF/CNF deployment

for calculating EE KPIs as listed in Table 5.1.3.2.1-1

The following SMO requirement is closely related to this topic:

[i.2] MoU Requirement rel3_CaaS_125: “O-Cloud platform shall provide sufficient power, energy and environmental (PEE) parameter and measurement data details in order to compute meaningful KPIs (e.g., state if the data is an instantaneous value or an average, declare the rolling window size in case of average, etc.) and, if appropriate, it should provide control over some parameters (e.g. change size of rolling window for average).”,
