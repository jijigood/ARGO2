    "This module defines the common groupings used by configuration management
    model for the O-RAN WG4 Cooperative Transport Interface.

    Note - this module comprises a number of re-usable groupings.
    It has been designed to be agnostic to model specific 'style-guides' used by
    the 'importing models', enabling the groupings to be incorporated into models
    defined externally to O-RAN Alliance (e.g., BBF and CableLabs) as well as
    incorporated into O-RAN alliance defined models.
