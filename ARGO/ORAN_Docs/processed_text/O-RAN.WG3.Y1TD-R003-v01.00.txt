Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG3 of the O-RAN Alliance.
The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows:
version xx.yy.zz
where:
xx:	the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
yy:	the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
zz:	the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

significant bits of the SD shall appear first in the string, and the character
representing the 4 least significant bit of the SD shall appear last in the string.
This is an optional parameter that complements the Slice/Service type(s) to allow
to differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices of the same Slice/Service type.
This IE shall be absent if no SD value is associated with the SST.
