Scope and Definitions

Scope

This document specifies the requirements, conditions, configurations, profiles, and sequences for interoperability testing of O-RAN O-CU and O-DU deployment scenarios with other O-RAN components in standalone (SA) mode.

This document complies with ORAN Testing and Integration Focus Group (TIFG) recommendation on a uniform documentation approach for interface testing specifications across all ORAN Working Groups (WGs).

The following interfaces (logical or physical) are covered in IOT test cases.

RLC-MAC

L1-L2

RRC-SDAP

SDAP-PDCP

RRC-PDCP

O1 interface

E2 interface

High Level Scenarios

Scenarios included in Release 3 of the IOT specification are aligned with ORAN-WG8.AAD [1]. In this release, the focus is on functional behavior and limited performance of O-CU/O-DU under different traffic scenario.

Cell Setup and activation.

SystemInformation (MIB, SIB1, SIB2 and SIB3).

RACH (with PRACH Format 0).

Registration and De-Registration procedure.

PDU session establishment and modification.

Idle mode Paging.

UDP data transfer (DL/UL).

O1 and E2 interface

Beam Management

The following are the performance scenarios:

Throughput under load condition in UL and DL.

Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to verify cell bring up is successful when the parameter occasion and CB-preambles per SSB is configured to 1 by SMO.

Reference Requirements

For detailed requirements, refer to the Chapter 9.2.1 in ORAN-WG8.AAD [1].

Initial Conditions

Following are the preconditions for this test.

Physical interface of DHCP(v4/v6) server, DNS server, CA/RA server, SMO, O-DU and O-RU is connected.

Use the default O-CU configuration files to configure all modules (NR RRC, NR PDCP, and SDAP) in O-CU.

O-RU is connected to O-DU. O-RU is deployed remotely and connected to O-DU using O-RAN WG4 defined hierarchical approach (Refer Chapter 2.3 of [22]).

O-CU is connected to O-DU.

O-CU is connected to 5GC through NG interface and O-CU is operational.

It is assumed that when Power-ON the O-DU, the NETCONF Server is started or when the O-DU is restarted, the NETCONF Server is restarted.

NETCONF Client is operational.

The O-DU have obtained their IPv4 addresses by auto-configuration using DHCPv4 OR O-DUs operating using stateful IPv4 or IPv6 address allocations, obtain SMO information during IP address allocation. (Note: If IPv6 is supported, O-DU may obtain their IPv6 addresses by stateless address auto-configuration, may use stateless DHCPv6, [23] to obtain SMO information).

The O-DU is be able to recover SMO information using O-RAN defined vendor specific option.  The SMO sends information to the O-DU using option 43 for DHCPv4 or option 17 for DHCPv6 as mentioned in Section 3.1.6 of [22]. Multiple instances of the SMO information may be signalled.

The PnfRegistration is successful with TLS secure connection is established between O-DU and SMO as per test case ORAN.WG8.IOT.017.

O-DU and O-RU are able to exchange the information between them.

Annex ZZZ: O-RAN Adopter License Agreement

BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O-RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O-RAN Alliance and the entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”).

This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification.

Section 1: DEFINITIONS

1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity.

1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether implemented in hardware, software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification.

1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications.

1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O-RAN Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates.

1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable by a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment of consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O-RAN Alliance or the date the patent claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent claims shall be considered Necessary Claims.

1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates.

Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE

2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in furtherance of implementations of an ORAN Specification.

2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written agreement with O-RAN Alliance.

Section 3: FRAND LICENSE

3.1 Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non- Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal grant to Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors, as set forth in Section 3.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Adopter’s distributors and the use by the Adopter’s customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations.

3.2 Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees.

3.3 Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates under Fair Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license will not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates that is not making a reciprocal grant to Adopter, as set forth in Section 3.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ distributors and the use by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations.

Section 4: TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1 This Agreement shall remain in force, unless early terminated according to this Section 4.

4.2 O-RAN Alliance on behalf of its Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors may terminate this Agreement if Adopter materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure or is not capable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days after being given notice specifying the breach.

4.3 Sections 1, 3, 5 - 11 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Under surviving Section 3, after termination of this Agreement, Adopter will continue to grant licenses (a) to entities who become Adopters after the date of termination; and (b) for future versions of ORAN Specifications that are backwards compatible with the version that was current as of the date of termination.

Section 5: CONFIDENTIALITY

Adopter will use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication, and dissemination of O-RAN Specifications to third parties, as Adopter employs with its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care. Any disclosure by Adopter to its Affiliates, contractors and consultants should be subject to an obligation of confidentiality at least as restrictive as those contained in this Section. The foregoing obligation shall not apply to any information which is: (1) rightfully known by Adopter without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to disclosure; (2) publicly available through no fault of Adopter; (3) rightfully received without a duty of confidentiality; (4) disclosed by O-RAN Alliance or a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor to a third party without a duty of confidentiality on such third party; (5) independently developed by Adopter; (6) disclosed pursuant to the order of a court or other authorized governmental body, or as required by law, provided that Adopter provides reasonable prior written notice to O-RAN Alliance, and cooperates with O-RAN Alliance and/or the applicable Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor to have the opportunity to oppose any such order; or (7) disclosed by Adopter with O-RAN Alliance’s prior written approval.

Section 6: INDEMNIFICATION

Adopter shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the O-RAN Alliance, its Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, and their employees, and agents and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (the “Indemnitees”), against any liability, damage, loss, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by or imposed upon any of the Indemnitees in connection with any claims, suits, investigations, actions, demands or judgments arising out of Adopter’s use of the licensed O-RAN Specifications or Adopter’s commercialization of products that comply with O-RAN Specifications.

Section 7: LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY; NO WARRANTY
