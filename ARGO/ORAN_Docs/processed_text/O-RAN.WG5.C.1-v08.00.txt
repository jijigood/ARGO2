1	Scope
The present document provides profiles for C-plane procedures and functions to achieve interoperability among different vendors. The profile specifies the expected behavior of each node, e.g., message flow of each use case, definitions of IEs, etc. which is not specified in 3GPP specifications. The profile specification provided in this document does not violate 3GPP specifications.
The use cases in this specification cover selected 3GPP functionalities. 
In the IE tables:
If optional IEs are essential for a use case to work, they are categorized ‘included’ in the IE tables.
If optional IEs are used under certain conditions applicable for this use case, they are categorized ‘optionally included’.
If optional IEs are not essential for the use case, they are set to ‘not included’.
One or more use cases described in this document can be initiated in a single procedure if this is allowed by 3GPP specifications. In these cases, the IE tables need to be augmented and the ‘included’ IEs of the procedure are the combination of ‘included’ IEs of the individual use cases, unless otherwise specified in 3GPP.
In addition, it is also possible to combine the initiation of one or multiple use cases of this document with other functions of the 3GPP procedure as defined in the relevant 3GPP specifications.
The use cases are described based on following two architectures defined by 3GPP for 5G.
For a description of the overall architecture in E-UTRA NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) also known as NR Non-Standalone (NSA) as depicted in Figure 1-1 see TS 37.340 [1].
Figure 1-1:	EN-DC Overall Architecture
The overall architecture of NG-RAN as shown in Figure 1-2 is described in TS 38.300 [6].
Figure 1-2:	NG-RAN Overall Architecture
1.1	UE connectivity options used in this document
The 3GPP architecture provides different options in the way a UE can connect to the network. Throughout this document the configuration options as explained in the following chapters are used. Note that these chapters focus on explaining the connectivity for the profiled use case. There might be additional bearers such as MCG or default bearers that are not shown in the figures.
1.1.1	NR Non-Standalone (NSA)
In the NSA architecture the UE relies on LTE access to attach to EPC network and uses NR as secondary RAT for increased throughput using dual connectivity. In this version of the specification EN-DC is used with different options to establish the UP bearer(s).
1.1.1.1	SN terminated SCG bearer (‘Option 3a’)
First UE connectivity option is typically referred to as ‘Option 3a’. The PDCP and S1-U terminate in en-gNB acting as Secondary Node (SN). From there SCG bearers are used to convey UP data to/from the UE (‘SN terminated SCG bearer’).
Figure 1.1.1.1-1:	SN terminated SCG bearer (‘Option 3a’)
1.1.1.2	SN terminated split bearer (‘Option 3x’)
This UE connectivity option also terminates UP PDCP in SN en-gNB, but the SN en-gNB splits the UP bearer in two legs utilizing X2-U and, if applicable F1-U, to send / receive UP data to/from the UE via bearer using RLC in both, MCG and SCG. This UE connectivity option is referred to as ‘Option 3x’ or ‘SN terminated split bearer’.
Figure 1.1.1.2-1:	SN terminated split bearer (‘Option 3x’)
1.1.1.3	SN terminated MCG bearer
This UE connectivity option terminates the UP PDCP and S1-U in the SN en-gNB. The SN en-gNB establishes a UP bearer leg utilizing X2-U to send and receive UP data to and from the UE via bearers using RLC in the MCG. This UE connectivity option is referred to as ‘SN terminated MCG bearer’.
Figure 1.1.1.3-1:	SN terminated MCG bearer
1.1.2	NR Standalone (SA)
In NR SA, also referred to as ‘Option 2’, the NG-RAN based on gNB RAN nodes only is connected to 5GC, i.e. no EPC is involved and ng-eNBs are not considered to be part of NG-RAN.
1.1.2.1	NR-DC with SN terminated Split bearer
In case a UE connects with option 2 and uses NR-NR dual connectivity (NR-DC) this specification in its current version is profiling cases where MN and SN are gNBs. 3GPP shows options to terminate NG-U on MN, SN or both. Current version of this specification considers use cases with PDCP terminated on SN. SN splits the UP bearer in a leg via Xn-U and, if applicable F1-U, to convey UP data via bearer using RLC in both, MCG and SCG (‘SN terminated split bearer’).
When profiling the NR SA SN terminated split bearer cases it was further assumed that MN is serving FR1 cells with a larger coverage area than FR2 cells served by SN.  By that the amount of unwanted mobility inter MN mobility events is reduced.
Figure 1.1.2.1-1:	NR-DC with SN terminated split bearer
1.2	UE connectivity options via IAB Node
The presence of IAB Nodes in the network is transparent to the UE. UE connectivity options remain the same as described in Section 1.1. There are no procedural changes to the UE.
1.3	IAB Node connectivity options
1.3.1	IAB Node connectivity in Standalone mode
This section describes control plane procedures for IAB (Integrated Access and Backhaul) in SA mode as defined in [7].
IAB SA mode means that IAB-node’s MT operates as UE using UE connectivity option NR SA. UEs (Access UEs) accessing the network over cells served by IAB nodes can be served using NSA and SA UE connectivity option.
The SA IAB architecture supported in this version of the specification is illustrated in Figure 1.3.1-1.

8	Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) Procedures
8.1	IAB procedures in Standalone mode
In this version of the profile, the following procedures based on [7] are defined for successful integration of IAB into the network:
IAB Donor DU Setup
IAB-MT Setup
BH RLC Channel Setup
Routing Update
IAB -DU Setup
The access UEs gaining services via cells supported by an IAB-Node may be served in both NSA and SA modes as described in section 1.1.
8.1.1	IAB Donor DU Setup
This section describes IAB Donor DU Setup. The purpose of this procedure is to exchange application-level data needed for IAB Donor DU and IAB Donor CU to interoperate over the F1 interface. This procedure also allocates a BAP address to the IAB Donor DU during F1 Setup/Cell activation procedures by the IAB Donor CU.
Note: As captured in section 8.2.3 of [3], it is implementation specific how an O-CU would determine if an O-DU is an IAB Donor DU.
8.1.1.1	IAB Donor DU Setup message flow
Please refer to chapters 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.
For the purposes of the IAB Donor DU setup procedural flow, the gNB-DU and gNB-CU identified in sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 shall be considered an IAB Donor DU and IAB Donor CU respectively.
8.1.1.2	F1-C IE handling
Please refer to sections 4.2.3.1.2, 4.2.4.1.2 and 4.2.5.1.2.
8.1.2	IAB Node1 integration
This section describes how IAB Node1 is integrated into the IAB Network. IAB Node1 shall be interpreted as any 1st hop IAB Node downstream of a Donor DU, for example, as shown in Figure 6.1.4-1 of [7].
8.1.2.1	IAB-MT Setup and BH RLC channel Setup
IAB-MT of the new IAB-Node connects to the network in the same way as a 5G UE, by performing RRC connection setup procedure with IAB Donor CU and authentication with the 5G core network.
The IAB-Node can select the parent node for access based on an over-the-air indication from potential parent node IAB-DU. The potential parent node indicates IAB support capability in system information (transmitted in SIB1).
8.1.2.1.1	IAB-MT and BH RLC Channel Setup message flow for F1
The following parameter conditions are applied for this procedure.
Figure 8.1.2.1.1-1 shows the flow for IAB-MT setup in SA mode.

8.1.2.1.2	F1-C IE handling
8.1.2.2	Routing Update
In this phase, IAB-MT requests TNL addresses for the collocated IAB-DU and secondly the BAP sublayer of the IAB Donor DU is updated with configuration to support routing between the new IAB-node and the IAB Donor DU.
As per section 8.12.1 of [7], TNL address request by IAB-MT can be support at any time after successful RRC Connection establishment. In that case, RRCReconfiguration in Step 5 of Figure 8.1.2.2.1-1 can be combined into the RRCReconfiguration in Step 18 of Figure 8.1.2.1.1-1.
The normative procedures in section 8.12.1 of [7] discusses TNL Address request as part of Phase 2-2: “Routing Update”.
The following parameter condition is applied for this procedure.
8.1.2.2.1	TNL Address Request message flow for F1
Figure 8.1.2.2.1-1 shows the flow whereby the IAB-MT requests one or more TNL Addresses for the collocated IAB-DU.
