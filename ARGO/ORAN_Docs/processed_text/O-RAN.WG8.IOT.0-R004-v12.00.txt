Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by O-RAN Alliance.
Modal verbs terminology
In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions).
"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.
1	Scope
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows:
version xx.yy.zz
where:
xx:	the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
yy:	the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
zz:	the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
This document specifies the requirements, conditions, configurations, profiles, and sequences for interoperability testing of O-RAN O-CU and O-DU deployment scenarios with other O-RAN components in standalone (SA) mode.
This document complies with ORAN Testing and Integration Focus Group (TIFG) recommendation on a uniform documentation approach for interface testing specifications across all ORAN Working Groups (WGs).
The following interfaces (logical or physical) are covered in IOT test cases.
RLC-MAC
L1-L2
RRC-SDAP
SDAP-PDCP
RRC-PDCP
O1 interface
E2 interface
High Level Scenarios
Scenarios included in Release 3 of the IOT specification are aligned with ORAN-WG8.AAD [1]. In this release, the focus is on functional behavior and limited performance of O-CU/O-DU under different traffic scenario.
Cell Setup and activation.
SystemInformation (MIB, SIB1, SIB2 and SIB3).
RACH (with PRACH Format 0).
Registration and De-Registration procedure.
PDU session establishment and modification.
Idle mode Paging.
UDP data transfer (DL/UL).
O1 and E2 interface
Beam Management
The following are the performance scenarios:
Throughput under load condition in UL and DL.
Static configuration files are used to configure O-CU and O-DU.
Assumptions
In current release of this test specification, the following assumptions have been made:
The F1 interfaces are assumed to comply with 3GPP release specifications [2], [15], [16] and [17].
O-CU and O-DU comply to the same version of the O-RAN Software Architecture specifications [1].
All elements in the interoperability test and the supporting test environment, where 3GPP support is relevant, comply to the same version of the 3GPP specification.
