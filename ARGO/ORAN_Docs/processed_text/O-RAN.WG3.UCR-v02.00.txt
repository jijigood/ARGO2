Objective
This document provides O-RAN WG3 Near-RT RIC Use Cases and Requirements, including E2 interface.
Use cases
3.1	Use case 1: Traffic Steering
This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for near RT RIC and E2 interface to support Traffic Steering, whose end-to-end requirements are defined in [23].
3.1.1	Background and goal of the use case
The rapid traffic growth and multiple frequency bands utilized in a commercial network make it challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution. Typical controls are limited to adjusting the cell reselection and handover parameters; and modifying load calculations and cell priorities.
The goal of Near-RT RIC Traffic Steering is to interpret the Policies received over A1 and to determine the optimum changes it can make towards achieving those goals. It may also leverage the A1 enrichment information.  Traffic Steering may reuse mechanisms provided by other use cases to effect the changes necessary to achieve its goals.
More specifically, Near-RT RIC triggers E2 procedure and related control/policies so as to obtain network performance that would fulfill the criteria identified in the A1 policies.
3.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case
OAM Functions in SMO domain:
Collect necessary measurement metrics from network level measurement report and enrichment data (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models
Deploy or update, configure the relevant TS optimization AI/ML models to Near-RT RIC via O1.
Non-RT RIC in SMO domain:
Send A1 policies and receive policy feedback to/from Near-RT RIC to drive resource optimization at RAN level.
E.g. TS targets as defined in [25]
Near-RT RIC:
Supports update of AI/ML models from SMO.
Supports inference, such as traffic prediction, using AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC based on network data, e.g. measurement reports from E2 Node.
Supports interpretation and execution of A1 policies from Non-RT RIC.
Sends TS resource optimization related policies and commands to E2 Node to influence RRM behavior.
Sends the relevant A1 policy feedback to Non-RT RIC for potential policy update.
Sends the relevant O1 performance data to OAM Functions; these may be used by Non-RT RIC for potential policy update
E2 Node:
Supports reporting of UE context, network measurements, and UE measurements to Near-RT RIC over E2 interface.
Executes policies and commands received from Near-RT RIC over E2 interface
Supports network and UE performance report to OAM Functions in SMO domain over O1 interface.
3.1.3	Solutions
In this section the possible processing modes of Traffic Steering are described. Figure 3.1.3-1 shows three general Traffic Steering processing modes and the transitions between them.
These modes represent the way the Near-RT RIC (or RAN) operates on a given group of UEs, and not the operation of any component as a whole.  As such, the Near-RT RIC, could be operating in both modes 1 and 2 concurrently for different sets of UEs.  For example, the transition from Mode 0 or 1 to 2 occurs only for a group of UE defined by the A1 policy Scope. At the same time, other UE groups may still be handled in Mode 0 and/or 1.
Figure 3.1.3-1: Traffic Steering Processing Modes
The three processing modes are described in more detail below:
“Baseline” Traffic Steering Behavior: OAM Functions in SMO domain uses O1 configuration on one or more E2 node to set up a desired baseline behavior.  This also sets up baseline Performance Monitoring of E2 Node by the SMO. In this mode, Near-RT RIC is not involved.
“Background” Near-RT RIC Processing: OAM Functions in SMO domain uses O1 configuration of near-RT RIC to set up a desired “background near-RT RIC behavior”.  In this mode the near-RT RIC sets up E2 mechanisms to monitor E2 Node and uses Traffic Steering related E2 mechanisms to achieve the desired background behavior of the set of E2 Nodes connected to the near-RT RIC.
“A1-Policy based” Near-RT RIC Processing: This mode may be entered from either Mode 0 or Mode 1.  Non-RT RIC in SMO domain uses A1-P to specify an A1 guided behavior for a targeted subset of E2 Nodes or UEs. If entering this from Mode 1, this will have the effect of modifying the existing near-RT RIC “background” behavior to include a more specific A1 guided behavior.  In this mode, the near-RT RIC may either set up or modify E2 mechanisms used to monitor E2 Nodes and will use Traffic Steering related E2 mechanisms to obtain the desired behavior of some targeted sub-set of E2 Nodes or UEs.  This mode terminates when the corresponding A1-P Policy Delete message is received from Non-RT RIC in SMO domain and the system returns to either Mode 0 or Mode 1, depending on whether or not OAM Functions in SMO domain had previously configured the optional Near-RT RIC “background” role (Mode 1).
Note 1: Processing Mode 0 is strictly not in scope for WG3.  It is described here for completeness and to clearly state what is the starting point prior to the WG2 and WG3 defined mechanisms.
Processing Mode 2 contain an ‘outer loop’ and an ‘inner loop’.  In the inner loop, a number of different “E2 mechanism” may be used (Policy, Report/Control or Insert/Control) towards a number of different target RAN functions in order to either exercise existing RAN mechanisms or modifying their ongoing behavior.  The appropriate mechanism and target RAN Function would depend upon the RAN Function capabilities to support a given E2 mechanism, the A1-P scope and policy, the O1 configuration of the RIC and the performance observed through E2 monitoring.

Figure 3.1.3.1-1: The overall procedure for Near RT RIC A1-Policy based Traffic Steering Use Case
3.1.4	Required data
This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the Traffic Steering use case. The requirements are specified in Section 4.
3.1.4.1 Control over E2
Mobility Control: serving cell can be chosen based on the resource status and QoS of the UE(s) targeted by an A1 Traffic steering policy. Moreover, load balancing can be achieved to improve the overall network performance. The following procedures can be used for Traffic Steering:
Handover from the source cell to the target cell
Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list
Configuration of idle mode mobility parameters
Enable, disable, or modify CA (3GPP TS 38.300[15], 3GPP TS 36.300[9], 3GPP TS 38.473[22], 3GPP TS 38.331[19], 3GPP TS 36.331[12] )
Enable, disable, or modify Dual Connectivity (3GPP TS 38.300[15], 3GPP TS 36.300[9], 3GPP TS 37.340[14], 3GPP TS 38.473[22], 3GPP TS 38.331[19], 3GPP TS 36.331[12] )
Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.
3.1.4.2	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes
The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:
UE ID (as defined in [24])
Slice level: S-NSSAI
DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.
QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).
UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities
For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used to derive the QoS requirements and the resource occupation; the UE capabilities may be required to select the appropriate RRM action (e.g. CA/DC configuration).
3.1.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes
The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the Traffic Steering use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g. handover control, DC, CA, idle mode mobility) by taking into account the RAN resource utilization, cell level and the UE level performance, the radio conditions, etc.
The following lists the examples of measurement information identified as required:
Table 3.1.4.3-1: Measurements from E2 Nodes
3.1.4.4 E2 node Configuration
Cell level configuration parameters, such as PCI, neighbor relations and related offsets etc. are needed at Near-RT RIC in order to e.g. configure UE measurements monitor cell level performance and manage mobility control (handover and cell reselection) according to the network topology and the related E2 parameters.
3.2	Use case 2: QoS Based Resource Optimization
This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support near real-time QoS aware resource optimization.
Based on the end-to-end requirements for the QoS based resource optimization use case defined in [23] section 3.8, some high-level functional descriptions and requirements over Near-RT RIC and E2 interface are introduced.
3.2.1	Background and goal of the use case
The network must offer means to prioritize resources while preserving the required QoS properties, e.g. reliability, latency, bandwidth requirements, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [3]. Current RAN network coverage and capacity depends on rigorous planning and configuration. However, due to varying nature of traffic demands and radio channels as well as multiple services to co-exist, it is hard to satisfy all QoS requirements simultaneously.
In summary, it is important for an E2 Node to achieve QoS targets as smoothly as possible. The QoS aware resource optimization should provide a refined granularity of radio resource allocation based on varying radio conditions and traffics in order to meet the diverse requirements of reliability, latency, and bandwidth simultaneously. In addition, it should coordinate allocation of radio resources for co-existing multiple services, which may have different priorities, to achieve the optimal utilization of radio resources.
In case when the network performance data is observed outside the boundary of the defined QoS targets, the Near-RT RIC should be able to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that the QoS indicators can move back within limits outlined in the A1 policies.
3.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case
OAM Functions in SMO domain:
Collect necessary measurement metrics from network level measurement report and enrichment data (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models
Deploy or update, configure the relevant QoS optimization AI/ML models to Near-RT RIC via O1.
Non-RT RIC in SMO domain:
Send A1 policies to and receive policy feedback from Near-RT RIC to drive resource optimization at RAN level.
E.g. QoS targets defined in TS 23.203 [3], such as GFBR, MFBR, Priority Level, PDB.
See WG2 A1AP specification [25] for more information.
Near-RT RIC:
Support update of AI/ML models from SMO.
Support inference, such as QoS prediction, using AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC based on network data, e.g. measurement reports from E2 Node.
Support interpretation and execution of A1 policies from Non-RT RIC.
Sending QoS resource optimization related policies and commands to E2 Node to influence RRM behavior.
Sending the relevant A1 policy feedback to Non-RT RIC for potential policy update.
Sending the relevant O1 performance data to OAM Functions, may be used by Non-RT RIC for potential policy update

Support reporting of UE context, network measurements, and UE measurements to Near-RT RIC over E2 interface.
Executes policies and commands received from Near-RT RIC over E2 interface
Support network and UE performance report to OAM Functions in SMO domain over O1 interface.

3.2.4	Required data
This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the QoS based resource optimization use case. The requirements are specified in Section 4.
3.2.4.1 Control over E2
DRB Control: RB control can be applied for modification of the following QoS properties:
DRB QoS modification (TS 38.473 [22], TS 23.501 [4]): The DRB level QoS may be tuned to accommodate A1 policy requirement.
QoS flow remapping (TS 38.473 [22]): The mapping relationship between QoS flows and DRBs may be adjusted.
Logical channel reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): The relevant parameters can be considered, e.g., priority, prioritized bit rate, bucket size duration, etc.
Radio Admission Control (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): DRB admission control such as reject or release may be applied.
Modification of dual-connectivity DRB (TS 37.340 [14]): change of bearer termination point (MN or SN) and/or bearer types (MCG/SCG/split), and control of split ratio for a split bearer.
Activation and deactivation of packet duplication and configuration of the number of legs in DC, CA, or DC+CA scenarios (TS 36.300 [9], TS 38.300 [15]).
RIC CONTROL (e.g. request for QoS flow remapping) or RIC POLICY (e.g. DRB admission policy) can be applicable.
Radio Resource Allocation, such as configuration of DRX, semi-persistent scheduling (SPS), or guidance for the scheduling and rate selection in MAC. For example, based on prediction, an E2 policy or control to reconfigure SPS configuration or ConfiguredGrantConfig for UL may be generated.
DRX reconfiguration (TS 38.473 [22], TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): Long DRX cycle length, Short DRX cycle length as well as short DRX cycle timer can be considered.
SR periodicity reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): Both sr-ProhibitTimer and sr-TransMax can be treated.
SPS configuration (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): Both SPS-Config (DL) and ConfiguredGrantConfig (UL) can be treated.
Reconfiguration of slice level PRB quota (TS 28.541 [5])
Configuration of CQI table with certain target block error rate (TS 38.214 [16])
Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used. For example, SPS can be configured via RIC CONTROL; RIC POLICY can be used, e.g. to set the guidance for the scheduler.
Radio Access Control: Depending on operator's policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and available services, different criterion will be used in determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when congestion occurs in the system, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [2]. For example, access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific cell in order to achieve better QoS for some UEs. A cell-level, UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Four categories of radio access control are indicated as below:
RACH Backoff
RRC Connection Reject
RRC Connection Release
Access Barring
Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.
Connection Mobility Control: For example, a neighbouring cell may be selected for the optimization of QoS of a specific UE. A neighbour handover restriction list may be configured to prevent the UEs from HO to some neighbouring cells in order to guarantee QoS of the UEs served by those neighbouring cells. Or, a capacity boosting mechanism may be used to achieve better QoS, e.g. enable CA/DC.
Handover from the source cell to the target cell
Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list
Enable, disable, or modify CA (TS 38.473 [22], TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])
Enable, disable, or modify dual connectivity (TS 38.473 [22], TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])
Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used. For the specific requirements and related stage-3 E2SM works, please refer to the Traffic Steering use case defined in Section 3.1.
3.2.4.2 UE Context Information from E2 Nodes
The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:
UE ID (as defined in [24])
Slice level: S-NSSAI
DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.
QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).
UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities
RLC/MAC/PHY level: e.g., logical channel, DRX, scheduling request, SPS configurations.
For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used for different granularity of controls over E2; an established DRB level information may be needed to change the mapping of QoS flows to a specific DRB or modify DRB attributes; the UE capabilities may be required to make sure if CA/DC can be enabled.
3.2.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes
The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the QoS based resource optimization use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g. RB control, handover, access control) by taking into account the runtime status in the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, it is required to specify those measurement parameters as possible as needed over E2 interface.
The following lists the examples of UE-level, cell-level, and slice-level measurement information identified as required:
(*) Detailed measurement definition will be provided in E2SM specifications.
3.3	Use case 3: RAN Slice SLA Assurance
The 3GPP standards architected a sliceable 5G infrastructure which allows creation and management of customized networks to meet specific service requirements that may be demanded by future applications, services and business verticals. Such a flexible architecture needs different requirements to be specified in terms of functionality, performance and group of users which may greatly vary from one service to the other. The 5G standardization efforts have gone into defining specific slices and their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on application/service type [2]. Since network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes the core network, the transport network and the radio access network (RAN), these requirements should be met at any slice subnet during the life-time of a network slice [5], especially in RAN side. Exemplary slice performance requirements are defined in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, latency and reliability at a high level in SDOs such as 3GPP [2] and GSMA [23]. These requirements are defined as a reference for SLA/contractual agreements for each slice, which individually need proper handling in NG-RAN.
Although network slicing support is started to be defined with 3GPP Release 15, slice assurance mechanisms in RAN needs to be further addressed to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN environment. It is necessary to assure the SLAs by dynamically controlling slice configurations based on slice specific performance information. Existing RAN performance measurements [7] and information model definitions [6] are not enough to support RAN slice SLA assurance use cases. This use case is intended to clarify necessary mechanisms and parameters for RAN slice SLA assurance.
3.3.1	Background and goal of the use case
In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific business requirements. These requirements include customizable network capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G standardization efforts, the 5G system should support the needs of the business through the specification of several service needs such as data rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN’s open interfaces and AI/ML based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

3.4.3.2 Beam-based Mobility Robustness Optimization (bMRO)
Beam-based Mobility Robustness Optimization (bMRO) is an autonomous self-optimizing algorithm that improves beam-based inter-cell mobility performance by applying beam-specific HO parameters including Cell Individual Offsets (CIO), Time to Trigger (TTT), T310 counter, etc. on the handover configuration between neighbor cells, based on the analysis of beam-specific mobility-related counters and/or mobility failure events. bMRO is capable to reduce the number of unnecessary handovers, handover failures as well as ping-pong handovers particularly in cells that cover areas with different mobility characteristics. Performance, complexity and gain analysis has been provided in [27, section 3.3]. Signaling overhead and complexity (RRC re-configuration, mobility reporting and O-CU reconfiguration messages) can be further reduced by beam grouping in which case beams with similar mobility characteristics comprise a beam group (e.g., group 1: low mobility pedestrian area, group 2: high mobility street). Mobility reports consist of aggregated mobility KPI/PMs (e.g., number of too early HOs, number of too late HOs, number of HO to wrong cell) or individual failure reports with root cause (e.g., to early HO, too late HO, HO to wrong cell) or a combination of the two. Reports are sent per each SSB beam or SSB beam group towards each neighbor cell. Individual mobility failure reports will also be reported per UE to allow UE or UE group-based optimization (besides beam or beam group specific reporting). While aggregated mobility KPIs/PMs are used for slow adaptations (e.g., 5 min), individual failure reports are used for faster adaptations (e.g., 100 ms) or for AI/ML based analysis of failure patterns. Measurement reporting periodicity and measurement type are configurable on a per cell basis considering the tradeoff between gain in mobility performance and associated signaling overhead. Mobility KPIs and failure events are forwarded from the O-CU to the Near-RT RIC, and the near-RT RIC configures the CIO and the measurement reporting in the O-CUs. CIOs might be beam- or beam group-based and can also be configurable per UE group (e.g., UE type, UE mobility or UE mode such as energy saving mode).
While AI/ML based approaches are not mandated, AI/ML methods/models can be used i) to build beam groups, to ii) decide on cell individual measurement configuration, to iii) detect changes in mobility characteristics (e.g., traffic jam) that trigger optimization, to iv) group UEs in UE groups as well as v) for the bMRO optimization algorithm itself to calculate the optimal cell individual offsets. In case of dynamic beam pattern optimization, relevant mMIMO beam pattern information must be available at the Near-RT RIC, e.g., mobility reports might indicate a specific beam pattern.
