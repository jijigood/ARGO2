Security for Fronthaul CUS-Plane
Introduction
The Open Fronthaul interface links the O-DU with the O-RU with a Lower Layer Functional Split-7-2x based architecture as specified in the O-RAN CUS-Plane specification [i.5]. The present document studies the security aspects of the control plane, user plane and synchronization plane protocols used over the Open Fronthaul interface.
Security for S-Plane
Introduction
Within a PTP domain, the grandmaster clock is the primary source of time for clock synchronization using Precision Time Protocol (PTP).
The IEEE 1588[i.10] standard specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the network’s grandmaster clock in a distributed fashion. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for the synchronization of the PTP slave nodes.
The BMCA is the basis of PTP functionality. The BMCA specifies how each clock on the network determines the best master clock in its subdomain of clocks, including itself. The BMCA runs on the network continuously and quickly adjusts for changes in network configuration.
ANNOUNCE messages are used by the BMCA in IEEE 1588[i.10] to build a clock hierarchy and select the grandmaster. A clock which considers itself a better master clock will transmit ANNOUNCE message to invoke a change of master clock. Once the current master recognizes the better clock, the current master stops transmitting SYNC messages and associated clock properties (ANNOUNCE messages in the case of IEEE 1588-2008) and the better clock takes over as master. The BMCA only considers the self-declared quality of clocks and does not take network link quality into consideration.
RFC 7384 [i.1] has a detailed threat analysis of several key issues and provides a set of security requirements for PTP. In the following clauses we identify and analyze relevant key issues when PTP is used in Open Fronthaul interface for timing and synchronization.
Key Issues
Key Issue #1: Impersonation of a Master clock (Spoofing) within a PTP network with a fake ANNOUNCE message
Introduction
The S-Plane must be protected against an attacker within the PTP network impersonating the master clock’s grandmaster Identity value and proposing himself as a grandmaster candidate by sending fake ANNOUNCE messages declaring him to be the best clock in the network. The attacker may be residing either within the attacked network (insider) or on an external network connected to the attacked network.
Threats
This attack results in a situation where the attacker clock becomes a GM, PTP is operational, all clocks are synchronized, but the malicious GM provides intentionally inaccurate timing information.
This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the O-RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.
A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.
Risk analysis
Impact:
High - as it can bring down all the cells that the impacted O-RUs are serving.
Likelihood:
High - Since ANNOUNCE messages can be seen publicly (as it is sent in clear text), it becomes easy for an attacker to spoof an existing master clock and use spoofed identity to declare itself as the master. This could be a bigger risk for a centralized timing network for the Open Fronthaul.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] The security mechanism for PTP shall support authentication of ANNOUNCE messages that allows slaves to authenticate the identity of the masters.  The authentication mechanism shall also verify that the sender is authorized to be a master.
[REQ-2] The system shall provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.
[REQ-3] The system shall provide integrity protection for ANNOUNCE messages
[REQ-4] The system shall provide replay protection for ANNOUNCE messages, for e.g. using a monotonously increasing packet sequence number.
[REQ-5] To handle insider attacks, proper hardening measures are essential that provides a barrier for insiders to login to a genuine clock and spoof a master. The system shall harden the clock nodes as per 3GPP TS 33.511 SCAS for gNB [i.11].
Key Issue #2: A Rogue PTP Instance wanting to be a Grand Master
Introduction
The S-Plane must be protected against an attacker proposing himself as a grandmaster candidate by sending manipulated/malicious ANNOUNCE messages declaring him to be the best clock in the network. The attacker causes other nodes in the network to believe it is a legitimate master. The attacker is internal to the attacked PTP network and could launch this attack by either modification of in-flight protocol packets or injecting fake ANNOUNCE messages to the PTP network. It is assumed that a MitM attacker has physical access to a segment of the network or has gained control of one of the nodes in the network.
Threats
This attack results in a situation where the time protocol is operational, but slaves are being provided intentionally inaccurate timing information.
This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the O-RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.
A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.
Risk analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium
Since ANNOUNCE messages can be seen publicly, it becomes easy for an attacker to spoof an existing master clock and use spoofed identity to declare itself as the master.
Potential Security Requirements
Same requirements indicated in 4.2.2.1.4
Key Issue #3: DoS attack against a Master clock
Introduction
The S-Plane must be protected against the denial of service (DoS) attack towards a Master clock of the timing network used by the Open Fronthaul to maintain the availability and accuracy of the Master clock. An attacker can attack a master clock by sending an excessive number of time protocol packets or impersonate a legitimate clock, a slave, or an intermediate clock, by sending malicious messages to the master, thus degrading the victim’s performance.
The attacker may be residing either within the attacked network (insider) or on an external network connected to the attacked network.
Threats
This attack results in a situation where the clock service is interrupted completely, or the timing protocol is operational, but slaves are being provided inaccurate timing information due the degraded performance of the Master clock.
This clock service disruption or degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the O-RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.
A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.
Risk analysis
Impact: High, especially for PTP network with telecom profile for time synchronization with full timing support from the network [i.2].
Likelihood: Medium
Since PTP messages are in clear text and there is no mandate for a master to authenticate its slaves, it becomes easy for an attacker to conduct the network reconnaissance, map out the entire timing network topology and launch the DoS attack against the Master clock.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] The security mechanism for PTP shall provide a means for a master clock to authenticate its slaves and verify that the sender of a protocol packet is authorized to send a packet of this type.
[REQ-2] The security mechanism for PTP shall provide a means (e.g. random session keys for authentication) for protection against PTP replay attack.
[REQ-3] A security mechanism that is external to PTP such as MACsec at layer 2 may provide link layer based security enabling authentication, integrity, and confidentiality (optional, because of the cadence of PTP protocol itself) for the PTP messages, and thus effectively hiding the timing network topology and preventing DoS attack against the Master clock or other nodes.
Key Issue #4: Selective interception and removal of PTP timing packets
Introduction
An attacker can position himself in such way that allows him to intercept and remove valid synchronization packets. This leads to clock synchronization errors of all clocks downstream or makes them go into free-running mode.
Attacks may be launched close to the GM by tapping the egress line of an active GM clock. This impacts a larger set of slaves who depend on this GM for timing synchronization.
Attacks may also target  one or more slaves. This is done by tapping the ingress line of a particular slave(s). The impact is confined to the targeted slaves.
Alternatively, a MiTM attacker can reside in an intermediate node such as T-TCs, routers and switches to launch this attack The attacker has physical access to a node of the PTP n/w or has gained full control of one device in the network. This requires additional capability to tap the h/w where PTP timing is implemented.
Threats
Selective interception and removal can impact timing packets and cause clock degradation in attacked nodes. Removing all packets or random packets may push the clocks in attacked nodes into free running mode.
This attack results in a situation where the time protocol is operational, but slaves are being provided intentionally inaccurate timing information.
This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the O-RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.
A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.
Risk Analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Low.
Attacker either has to tap into a line or has complete control of an intermediate node to launch this attack. In an operator network, it is expected that physical assets including transmission lines are adequately protected from tampering and sabotage.
Potential Security Requirements
There shall be a security mechanism that provides protection against MitM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks.
NOTE: Cryptographic security protocols cannot protect against packet drops. One suggested mechanism is to have a secure architecture that provides redundant paths between GM and slaves, which then allows the operator to switch to another path between GM and slaves.
Key Issue #5: Packet delay manipulation attack
Introduction
IEEE 1588 requires symmetric delays between GM and slaves. In packet delay manipulation attacks, the attacker is positioned such a way that allows him to delay the transmission of legitimate time synchronization protocol packets to the intended destination.
An attacker launches this attack by either tapping the transmission network or by taking control of an intermediate nodes such as routers, switches and T-TCs.
Threats
This attack results in a situation where the time protocol is operational, but slaves are being provided intentionally inaccurate timing information.
This degradation in the accuracy of time may cause DoS to applications on all the O-RUs that rely on accurate time, potentially bringing down the cell.
A cell outage caused by misaligned time, may further impact performance in connected neighboring cells.
Risk Analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Low.
Attacker either has to tap into a line or has complete control of an intermediate node to launch this attack. In an operator network, it is expected that physical assets including transmission lines are adequately protected from tampering and sabotage.
Potential Security Requirements
Same as 4.2.2.4.4.
Solutions
Solution #1: Hardening of Fronthaul infrastructure
Implementing protection for S-Plane PTP messages is challenging for the following reasons:
-	Need hardware support on new devices for timestamping and support for it in existing devices. Vendors would require at least 2yrs to implement this feature in their products. Until then their products will not be O-RAN standards compliant.
-	Any e2e security between Master and Slave, will disallow use of transparent clocks in the network as it needs to update the correction field.
-	Also, this means legacy equipment can never be "O-RAN Compliant". For WG4, this would be considered a non-backward-compatible change to the FH interface.
It is therefore infeasible to realize the solution with the present state of hardware availability in the market.
Security for S-Plane PTP messages would be implicitly achieved by hardening of all the network elements in the Open Fronthaul network including O-RU, intermediary switches, and physically securing all the underlying infrastructure including transmission wires etc.
Solution #2: Using Layer-2 MACsec for protecting S-Plane messages
MACsec [i.9] could be a possible solution for protection of S-Plane messages. When MACsec is used, PTP messages are protected at Layer 2.
Evaluation of the impact of using MACsec on S-Plane messages are discussed in clause 4.2.4.1.
Solution #3: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1X Port Based Access Control
In order to prevent an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization, it is essential to implement authentication and authorization for PTP nodes.
The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:
O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.
O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RUs at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).
IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [i.4] provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network. It provides a solution for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.
Clause 4.5.2.1 provides an e2e solution of protecting the Open FH Interface using Port Based Access Control.
Solution #4: Providing redundancy in Open Fronthaul synchronization architecture
In order to protect the S-Plane against MitM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [i.1] it is essential to have redundancy and resiliency in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.
- The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture supports simultaneous Grandmasters.
- The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture supports the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.
O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [i.13] Clause 8.2.4 provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
Solution #5: Using the PTP integrated security mechanism
General
To ensure the security of the S-plane in the O-RAN fronthaul, we propose implementing the authentication mechanism as defined in IEEE 1588-2019 ([i.10]), clause 16.14. This involves using the AUTHENTICATION TLV to provide source authentication, message integrity, and replay attack protection for PTP Announce messages within a PTP domain.
Key Management Scheme for the PTP integrated security mechanism
For a security key management scheme, we propose the following options:
GDOI: GDOI (“Group Domain of Interpretation”, [i.15]) is a group key management protocol that provides secure distribution and management of cryptographic keys to multiple entities in a group. It enables efficient and scalable authentication and encryption for large networks.
TESLA: TESLA (“Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication”, [i.16]) is a one-way hash chain-based authentication mechanism that provides message authentication, allowing all message receivers to check the integrity and authenticate the source of each message in multicast or broadcast data streams.
Direct configuration: Direct configuration involves manually configuring the security keys on each network element.
Evaluation and Conclusions
Solution #2: Using Layer-2 MACsec for protecting S-Plane messages
Evaluation
Implementation challenges in PTP over MACsec
MACsec [i.9] provides point-to-point security on Ethernet links. However, PTP over MACsec implementation has its challenge. There are two types of clock implementation in PTP – one-step clock and two-step clock. Each of these has its challenges in implementing PTP over MACsec with regards to PTP Sync message transmission.
Implementation challenge in Sync message transmission in one step clock
In one step clock implementation, egress timestamp of Sync message is inserted in Sync message itself.
Figure 4.2.4.1.1.1.1-1 One-step Clock of PTP over MACsec on Tx Side
If MACsec is used as a security solution for PTP, T1 timestamp insertion must happen before MACsec layer to secure Sync message. If time taken from actual message timestamp point to ideal message timestamp point is fixed and known  a priori, then timestamp generated can be compensated with this time (known as egressLatency). For each message transmission, MACsec layer compute Integrity Check Value (ICV) based upon the content of the message and inserts it in the message. The time taken to compute ICV is unknown, and the spec does not mandate any upper limit for the same. This makes estimation of egressLatency unpredictable, thus degrades accuracy and precision of T1 timestamps carried in Sync message.
Implementation challenge in Sync message transmission in two-step clock
In two step clock, T1 timestamp is carried in a subsequent Follow Up message. Since Sync message does not carry T1 timestamp, this timestamp can be generated after MACsec layer. So, accuracy and precision of T1 timestamp does not suffer from jitter in egressLatency. However, after Sync message transmission, corresponding T1 timestamp needs to be communicated back to 1588 layer so that generated Follow Up message can be protected by MACsec layer beneath it. In certain implementations without MACsec, the job of sending Follow Up message is offloaded to hardware port so that 1588 layer is concerned only about generating Sync message and thus can scale better. With PTP over MACsec implemented, this type of implementation might not be scalable especially in a device with many ports.
Implementation challenge in PTP event message reception
There could be two possible ways of timestamping in case of PTP event message reception in a PTP over MACsec implementation.
Figure 4.2.4.1.1.1.3-1 PTP over MACsec on Rx Side
In an implementation, as shown in the figure above, timestamp can be generated only after MACsec validates the integrity of the received PTP event message. However, this timestamp needs to be compensated for the time it takes for the message to reach from ideal message timestamp point to actual message timestamp point. This time is known as ingressLatency. However, due to unpredictable time it takes for computing ICV on received messages, ingressLatency becomes hard to predict. Ultimately it degrades accuracy and precision of receive timestamps of PTP event messages.
In another kind of implementation, to avoid the issue owing to potential jitter in ICV computation time, receive timestamp can be generated for each message at a point below MACsec layer. Once MACsec layer validates a message and it is identified as PTP event message, corresponding receive timestamp can be used for further PTP related processing. However, this approach can suffer since this requires all received messages to be timestamped and non-PTP messages could be received at close to line rate of the interface.
Deployment challenges in PTP over MACsec
There are four S-Plane deployment scenarios for the O-RAN Open Fronthaul described in [i.5] and illustrated in the figure below.
Figure 4.2.4.1.1.2-1 Topology Configurations of S-Plane Deployment Scenarios
Configuration LLS-C1 is based on point-to-point connection between O-DU and O-RU using network timing option. As shown above, it is the simplest topology for network timing option, where O-DU directly synchronizes O-RU.
Configuration LLS-C2 is similar to LLS-C1 with O-DU acting as master to distribute network timing toward O-RU. One or more Ethernet switches are allowed between the central site (hosting O-DUs) and the remote sites (hosting O- RUs). All the switches in the synchronization path will need to support PTP with hop-by-hop MACsec for security protection. Therefore, the aggregated PDVs (Packet Delay Variation) introduced by MACsec on each LAN segment along the synchronization path poses significant deployment challenges to meet the O-RAN S-Plane timing requirement.
Configuration LLS-C3 is similar to LLS-C2 except frequency and time distribution is made by the fronthaul network itself (not by the O-DU). That means that one or more PRTC/T-GM are implemented in the fronthaul network to distribute network timing toward O-DU and O-RU. One or more Ethernet switches are allowed between the central site (hosting O-DUs) and the remote sites (hosting O-RUs). Also, similar to LLS-C2, all the switches in the synchronization path will need to support PTP with hop-by-hop MACsec for security protection. Therefore, the aggregated PDVs (Packet Delay Variation) introduced by MACsec on each LAN segment along the synchronization path between T-GM and T-TSC (O-RU or O-DU) poses significant deployment challenges to meet the O-RAN S-Plane timing requirement.
Under configuration of LLS-C4, local or remote PRTC time source option is allowed at O-RU and O-DU respectively, there is no PTP based S-Plane required for the Fronthaul. Therefore, PTP over MACsec is not applicable in this deployment scenario.
Conclusion
Due to implementation and deployment challenges, MACsec as a security solution for PTP is not recommended for Fronthaul network. However, if synchronization performance is guaranteed by implementation, then PTP over MACsec can be used in LLS-C1 topology.
Solution #3: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1X Port Based Access Control
Evaluation
The S-Plane should support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.
This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane by ensuring the authenticity of PTP nodes communicating over the Open Fronthaul network.
Conclusion
IEEE 802.1X Port-based Network Access Control [i.4]  restricts  network access to authorized PTP nodes.
Solution #4: Providing redundancy in Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture
Evaluation
This clause addresses the Key Issue#4 as defined in clause 4.2.2.4
An architectural recommendation to S-plane security is proposed based on redundancy and resiliency in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
.
Conclusion
Implementing redundancy and resiliency synchronization architecture provides timing/sync reliability by avoiding single point failure.
Security for C-Plane
The O-RAN interface is divided into C-Plane and U-Plane parts.
The C-Plane must be available in order to process the corresponding U-Plane packets.
The main purpose of these messages is to transmit data-associated control information required for processing of user data (e.g., scheduling and beamforming commands).
To support coordination of C-Plane and U-Plane timing, the O-RAN interface specifies that C-Plane messages must arrive at the O-RU some amount of time in advance (Tcp_adv_dl) of the latest possible time the first corresponding U-Plane messages may arrive.
The control information will not be transmitted via the eCPRI specific protocol.
This information can use protocols (e.g. TCP) over the IP protocol but any other solution is not precluded.
The control information flow will be considered as real-time control and utilize a small part of the total bandwidth between eCPRI entities.
Loss of a C-Plane packet is serious, with the possibility of impacting an entire slot’s worth of data. -> A broader impact is also possible with C-Plane packet loss: if downloaded beamforming weights, beamforming attributes, or channel information is lost then a beamId may be incorrectly associated with an “old” set of beamforming weights thereby possibly impacting multiple slots. (packet loss can be detected via the sequence number so a recovery action may be taken to re-send messages)
Editor’s Note: It is FFS how the sequence number recovery would work in case of injection of higher values.
Key Issues
Key Issue #1: Spoofing of DL C-Plane messages
Introduction
A DL C-Plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU at least Tcp_adv_dl before the end of DL U-Plane receive window for symbol startSymbolId (the earliest symbol described by the message).
Threats
The lack of authentication could allow an adversary to inject own DL C-Plane messages that falsely claiming to be from the associated O-DU.
As a result, it would block the O-RU to process the corresponding U-Plane packets, leading to temporary DoS. (dropping the entire DL C-Plane messages would achieve same goal)
Risk analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium
An attacker needs physical  access to the network transporting C-Plane messages.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] The security mechanism for C-Plane shall support authentication of <DL C-Plane messages> to allow O-RU to authenticate the O-DU (transport-based endpoint identifiers). The authentication mechanism shall also verify that the O-DU is authorized to serve the O-RU.
Key Issue #2: Spoofing of UL C-plane messages
Introduction
A UL C-Plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU at least t2a_min_cp_ul before the earliest air interface UL signal sample of symbol startSymbolId (the earliest symbol described by the message) arrives at O-RU antenna. UL C-Plane messages from O-RU to O-DU are only defined in case of LAA operations. 
(otherwise, there should be no C-Plane messages originated by the O-RU).
Threats
The lack of authentication could allow an adversary to inject its own UL C-Plane messages that falsely claiming to be from the associated O-DU.
As a result, temporarily limited cell performance (or even DoS) on cells served by the O-RU and in addition a consequential threat to all O-RUs parented to that O-DU might exist. (dropping the entire UL C-Plane messages would achieve same goal)
Risk analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium
An attacker needs physical  access to the network transporting C-Plane messages.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] The security mechanism for C-Plane shall support authentication of <UL C-Plane messages> to allow O-RU to authenticate the O-DU (transport-based endpoint identifiers). The authentication mechanism shall also verify that the O-DU is authorized to serve the O-RU as well as that the O-RU is authorized to communicate to the O-DU.
Key Issue #3: Loss of Availability of Cell (Sleeping Cell) caused by C-Plane message tampering.
Introduction
In mobile communication a sleeping cell is an unlocked cell that is transmitting on the broadcast channel, has no alarms active yet is unable to setup calls.
Threats
An attacker may tamper DL C-Plane messages to exploit possible vulnerabilities in the C-Plane protocol or C-Plane endpoint implementation to cause an active cell to become a sleeping cell. As a result, this would result in cell unavailability, leading temporarily to DoS.
Risk analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium; An attacker needs physical access to the network transporting C-Plane messages. Vulnerabilities in the C-Plane protocol or C-Plane endpoint implementation need to exist.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] Authenticated integrity protection should protect C-Plane data flows through the fronthaul network, as that would allow the O-RU to detect altered messages and prevent their execution.
Further security measures include:
Regular Patching and Updates: Keeping the C-Plane related software up to date by regularly applying security patches and updates provided by the vendor. This ensures that known vulnerabilities are fixed, reducing the risk of exploitation.
Network Segmentation: Implementing network segmentation to isolate critical systems from the rest of the network. This limits the potential impact of a C-Plane protocol stack vulnerability by containing the attack within a smaller network segment.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Deploying IDPS solutions to monitor network traffic and detect potential IP stack attacks in real-time. These systems can identify and block malicious activities, providing an additional layer of defense against exploitation.
Key Issue #4: C-Plane volumetric DoS attacks.
Introduction
Attackers may overwhelm a target system's network bandwidth or computing resources by flooding it with a massive volume of traffic. This is called a volumetric Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
Threats
Threats of attackers mounting volumetric DoS attacks include
Bandwidth Exhaustion: Attackers generate a large amount of traffic directed at the target's network interfaces, consuming all available bandwidth. This can result in legitimate data flows being unable to access the services or resources provided by the target system.
Resource Consumption: Volumetric DoS attacks consume significant computing resources of the target, such as CPU, memory, or network connections. This can lead to degraded performance or even a complete system failure, rendering the target inaccessible.
Network Congestion: The high volume of malicious traffic overwhelms the network infrastructure between the attacker and the target, causing congestion and potentially impacting other network services or users.
Risk analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium; An attacker needs physical access to the network transporting C-Plane messages and sufficient resources to actually overwhelm the network/target.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] Authenticated integrity protection and anti-replay protection should allow the target to detect all legitimate messages with relatively low processing overhead. This would allow the target to defend against resource consumption.
[REQ-2] As a further security measure Traffic Monitoring and Analysis can be employed, i.e. implementing network traffic monitoring and analysis tools to detect and identify abnormal traffic patterns that may indicate a volumetric DoS attack. Solutions like intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) or traffic anomaly detection systems can assist in real-time detection. Physical security and system Log monitoring can also help mitigate this type of an attack.
Key Issue #5: Intentionally causing delay or dropping of C-Plane messages carrying scheduling and beam forming commands
Introduction
UL C-Plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU at least t2a_min_cp_ul before the earliest air interface UL signal sample of symbol startSymbolId (the earliest symbol described by the message) arrives at O-RU antenna.
DL C-Plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU at least Tcp_adv_dl before the end of DL U-Plane receive window for symbol startSymbolId (the earliest symbol described by the message).
Threats
Any delay in the arrival of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard UL C-Plane and DL C-Plane traffic from O-DU and the UE causing a denial of service for the impacted UEs.
Risk analysis
Impact: Medium
Likelihood: Medium
An adversary or insider would need to have direct (physical) access to the network path between O-DU and O-RU to employ active monitoring techniques to intercept messages. The adversary can then store and forward the intercepted messages, inducing an intentional delay in the arrival of the message at the O-RU. This would cause the O-RU to drop /discard UL C-Plane and DL C-Plane traffic resulting in a DoS attack on the O-RU.
Potential Security Requirements
None
Key Issue #6: Targeted Reconnaissance attack on a user
Introduction
When the flow indicator (eAxCID) is carried in clear text, an attacker can look at this information to target a certain user in a certain physical location. User Identity is not revealed, but there could be scenarios where an attack can be pre-meditated on a well-known user based on the available location of the user at a certain point in time.
Threats
This attack can be used to launch a reconnaissance attack on the targeted user based on the flow indicator.
Risk analysis
Impact: Medium
Likelihood: Low
Malicious actors can engage in passively monitoring the beamforming information for reconnaissance purposes. However, conducting a successful reconnaissance attack of this nature requires prior knowledge of the targeted user's movement patterns and required infrastructure.  The post-processing needed to extract useful user-specific information is a complex and exhaustive process.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] The C-Plane data should be encrypted to prevent an insider to intercept or gather sensitive information on a targeted user.
This requirement applies to deployment scenarios where the O-RU and O-DU are in two separate locations connected via a switched fronthaul network. Refer to Annex B for additional information.
NOTE: In scenarios where the O-RU and O-DU are collocated and confined within the secure perimeter of a cell-site location, the need for encryption of C-Plane messages is reduced.
Physical security of a cell site is ensured by security measures like restricted access to the site which means only authorized personal, should be allowed entry and access may be controlled by keycards, biometrics, or other secure mechanisms. Additionally, surveillance systems, and secure enclosures for the O-RAN components, regular audit and inspections are other measures that ensure perimeter security of a cell site.
Key Issue #7: Tampering of DL C-Plane messages in a switched fronthaul network
Introduction
C-Plane messages may contain control information necessary for the O-RU like resource mapping, beamforming, and DL power control to properly perform its tasks. Switched fronthaul networks are described as LLS-C2, LLS-C3 and LLS-C4 types of fronthaul networks in [i.5], clause 11.2.2.
Threats
Depending on the installation topology, the O-DU and O-RU can be in physically separate locations. The network path between the O-DU and O-RU can be publicly accessible and does not require any physical access protections. The network interface is an industry standard interface with publicly available testing and analysis tools.
An attacker may tamper DL C-Plane messages to
Distort the mapping of the logical flows onto the physical resources.
Distort the beamforming (the UE doesn't receive the signal as the beams are modified).
Modify the commands for DL power, possibly leading to inadequacy between the MCS and the DL power, leading to insufficient SINR or, conversely, PA saturation.
Issue Network Energy Saving C-Plane commands that turn off the O-RU disrupting all traffic.
As a result, this would result in cell unavailability, leading temporarily to DoS.
Risk analysis
This risk analysis expects that no security measures are applied, i.e. the network is set up as a single broadcast region and all messages are unprotected.
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium - An attacker needs access to the network transporting C-Plane messages. Depending on the installation topology, the network path between the O-DU and O-RU can be publicly accessible.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] Authenticated integrity protection should protect all C-Plane data flows through the fronthaul network, as that would eliminate all options for an attacker of tampering with or injecting C-Plane messages.
[REQ-2] Further security measures include:
Network Segmentation: Implementing network segmentation to isolate critical systems from the rest of the network. This limits the potential impact of a C-Plane protocol stack vulnerability by containing the attack within a smaller network segment.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Deploying IDPS solutions to monitor network traffic and detect potential IP stack attacks in real-time. These systems can identify and block malicious activities, providing an additional layer of defense against exploitation.
NOTE 1: Authenticated integrity protection does not prevent an attacker from blocking the control messages which could also lead to DoS and cell unavailability.
Key Issue #8: C-Plane protocol stack vulnerability attacks in a switched fronthaul network
Introduction
Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation of the protocol stack termination points on the O-RAN Open Fronthaul C-Plane. Switched fronthaul networks are described as LLS-C2, LLS-C3 and LLS-C4 types of fronthaul networks in [i.5], clause 11.2.2.
Threats
Threats of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities include
Remote Code Execution: If an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability in the C-Plane protocol stack implementation, they can execute arbitrary code on the target system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and further compromise of the O-RU or O-DU.
Information Disclosure: Vulnerabilities in the C-Plane protocol stack can lead to unintended information disclosure, such as leaking sensitive data or exposing system configurations. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain valuable insights about the targeted system, which can be used for further attacks.
Protocol Exploitation: Exploiting protocol vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, network manipulation, or the injection of malicious packets into the network.
Risk analysis
This risk analysis expects that no security measures are applied, i.e. the network is set up as a single broadcast region and all messages are unprotected.
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium; An attacker needs physical access to the network transporting C-Plane messages.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] Authenticated integrity protection should protect all C-Plane data flows through the fronthaul network, as that would eliminate all options for an attacker of exploiting vulnerabilities in the C-Plane protocol stack.
[REQ-2] Further security measures include:
Regular Patching and Updates: Keeping the C-Plane related software up to date by regularly applying security patches and updates provided by the vendor. This ensures that known vulnerabilities are fixed, reducing the risk of exploitation.
Network Segmentation: Implementing network segmentation to isolate critical systems from the rest of the network. This limits the potential impact of a C-Plane protocol stack vulnerability by containing the attack within a smaller network segment.

Solutions
Solution1: Layer-2 MACsec for protecting C-plane messages
The clear text nature of the C-Plane messages over the Ethernet exposes the open-fronthaul to the threats and risks identified in clause 4.3.1.
MACsec [i.9] is a Layer 2 security protocol providing data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and authenticity of data origin. It ensures that data transmitted over Ethernet networks is protected from eavesdropping, denial of service, passive monitoring, and tampering.
The recommendation is to establish MACsec between the O-RU and O-DU in an end-to-end tunnel mode. With this solution the intermediary switches need not be MACsec aware, and we overcome the deployment challenges faced in hop-by-hop MACsec.
As per the guidelines provided in IEEE 802.1AE-2018[i.9], C-Plane data should be protected using MACsec in scenarios where the O-RU and O-DU are in two separate locations connected via a switched fronthaul network.
In this solution, the functional blocks of controlled port, uncontrolled port, and Ethernet Data Encryption (EDE), as defined in the standard IEEE 802.1AE -2018[i.9] clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 15.6 are used to selectively apply MACsec for C-plane messages.
Clause 4.6.4 provides an e2e solution of protecting the Open FH Interface. The C-plane messages are sent on controlled port where MACsec is applied, while S-plane messages are transmitted unprotected on uncontrolled port.
Evaluation and Conclusions
Evaluation
MACsec is a viable solution for securing C-Plane traffic in the Open Fronthaul network. This solution addresses the key issue#3, #4, #6 in clause 4.3.1.
Conclusion
IEEE 802.1AE-2018[i.9] MACsec is recommended as a solution to protect C-plane messages on the Open Fronthaul interface. For selective encryption of C-plane messages alone, C-plane messages are transmitted via controlled port as described in clause 4.6.4.
MACsec is configured in an end-to-end tunnel mode. This approach eliminates the necessity for intermediary switches to be MACsec aware, thus addressing deployment challenges encountered in hop-by-hop MACsec.
Security for U-Plane
Key Issues
Key Issue #1: Tampering of U-Plane messages.
Introduction
U-Plane messages contain information necessary like the I/Q and RACH packets to properly perform its tasks.
Threats
An attacker may
Tamper with I/Q packets OR
Discard valid I/Q packets and replaces them by fake ones.
Tamper with RACH messages OR
Discard valid RACH packets and replaces them by fake ones.
As a result, this would result in cell unavailability.
Risk analysis
Impact: High
Likelihood: Medium
An attacker needs access to the network transporting U-Plane messages.
Potential Security Requirements
[REQ-1] Authenticated integrity protection should protect all U-Plane data flows through the fronthaul network and would eliminate all option for an attacker of tampering.
Solutions
Solution1: Layer-2 MACsec for protecting U-Plane messages
The U-Plane data packets that carry information related to I/Q samples  and PRACH are transported  over Open Fronthaul as encapsulated Ethernet packets and are not integrity protected. These messages are susceptible to attacks described  in clause 4.4.1.1. Additionally, an adversary can also tamper with the eCPRI and O-RAN headers that remain unprotected.
The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [i.17] provides confidentiality and integrity protection of 5G System Control Plane and User Plane between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE, However, the above messages are not protected by PDCP.
MACsec [i.9], Layer 2 security protocol providing data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and authenticity of data origin is considered as a potential solution for protecting U-Plane data. It ensures that data transmitted over Ethernet networks is protected from eavesdropping, denial of service, passive monitoring, and tampering.
One of the concerns for proposing MACsec as potential security solution for U-Plane is the impact on Performance. However, with the MACsec evolving from local-area network (LAN) encryption technology to a much wider area in WAN transport along with Hardware based encryption and decryption enables to meet the performance and latency requirements in an Open Fronthaul network.
The potential solution is to enable MACsec[i.9] in an end-to end tunnel mode for protecting U-Plane messages[PRACH, PUCCH,SSB, O-RAN Application and eCPRI headers] in the Open FH network. The decision to enable MACsec on the fronthaul network elements depends on the specific deployment scenarios outlined in the Fronthaul CUS Plane Security Analysis Technical Report.With this solution the intermediary switches need not be MACsec aware, and we overcome the deployment challenges faced in hop-by-hop MACsec.
In this solution, the functional blocks of controlled port, uncontrolled port, and Ethernet Data Encryption (EDE), as defined in the standard IEEE 802.1AE -2018[i.9] clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 15.6 are used to selectively apply MACsec for C-Plane and U-Plane messages.
Clause 4.6.4.2 provides an e2e solution of protecting the Open FH Interface. The C,U-Plane  messages are sent on controlled port where MACsec is applied, while S-plane messages are transmitted unprotected on uncontrolled port.
Evaluation and Conclusions
Evaluation
MACsec is a viable solution for securing U-Plane traffic in the Open Fronthaul network. This solution addresses the key issue#1 clause 4.4.1. Based on the topology options described in clause 4.3.2.1, MACsec can be enabled at various elements constituting the Open Fronthaul network.
Conclusion
IEEE 802.1AE-2018[i.9] MACsec is recommended as a solution to protect U-plane messages on the Open Fronthaul interface.
Security for Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical layer interface
Key Issues
Key Issue #1: Unauthorized access to Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical layer interface(s)
Introduction
The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. Each end of the Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, e.g., O-DU, O-RU, etc., as described in [i.5] and [i.7].
Unauthorized access to the Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical layer interface (cables and connections) provides a means to launch attacks on the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the Open Fronthaul system.
Threats
Potential loss of availability on the Open Fronthaul interface can occur from one or more of the following threats:
An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface can flood the L1 interface with unintended network traffic causing disruption or degradation of authorized network elements on the Open Fronthaul interface.
An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface can send L2 messages to authorized network devices causing disruption, denial, or degradation of the Open Fronthaul interface. This threat enables the attacks described in Key Issue 1, 2, and others.
An attacker (person) gains access to the Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 interface(s) and denies the Open Fronthaul services by disabling a physical connection to a network element either by removing an Ethernet port connection or cutting the physical interface (coaxial cable, twisted pair, or optical fibre).
Potential loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity on the Open Fronthaul interface can occur from one or more of the following threats:
•	An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface has access to U-Plane traffic on the Open Fronthaul Interface.
•	An unauthorized device on the Ethernet L1 Interface has access to S-Plane traffic on the Open Fronthaul Interface.

Solutions
Solution #1 Port Based Access Control for Open Fronthaul Network
This solution addresses KI #1 in clause 4.5.1.1.
Zero trust principles [i.3] call for least privileged access where the Open Fronthaul network should only allow network access to authorized network elements. IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) [i.4] may be used to restrict access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network.
The scope of these requirements span those relevant to the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprising port-based network control between supplicant and authenticator entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 and as further described in this section. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification.
[REQ1] Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.
Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network
An Open Fronthaul Network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, and PRTC-T/GM [i.5][i.6][i.7].
[REQ 2] Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 NAC supplicant functionality for each Port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.
Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network
In IEEE 802.1X-2020 NAC a supplicant mutually authenticates with an authenticator.
[REQ 3] Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.
[REQ 4] An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 NAC.

[REQ Y] X.509 certificate renewal for all network elements using CMPv2.
Security at Fronthaul Layer 2 using MACsec
MACsec could be an option for the security solution of all traffic except S-Plane PTP due to implementation and deployment challenges of PTP over MACsec detailed in section 4.2.4. Clause 4.3.2.1 of the Technical Report recommends using MACsec for encryption of C-Plane traffic. MACsec has been recommended as a security mechanism for protection of U-Plane messages.
In the following clauses, we are going to focus on the MACsec option for securing the C-Plane and M-Plane traffic under Open Fronthaul deployment topologies described in [i.5].
MACsec in LLS-C1 topology running PTP G.8275.1 profile
Figure 4.6.1-1: C-Plane and M-Plane protection based on MACsec in LLS-C1 topology
As shown in the above figure, eCPRI/C-Plane and M-Plane traffic is protected by MACsec. It is recommended that PTP remains unprotected due to PTP over MACsec implementation challenges. PTP may use its own integrity security mechanism. However, if synchronization performance is guaranteed by any implementation, then MACsec as a security solution for PTP is not precluded in this topology.
MACsec in LLS-C2 topology running PTP G.8275.1 profile
Figure 4.6.2-1 C-Plane and M-Plane protection based on MACsec in LLS-C2 topology
As shown in the above figure, eCPRI/C-Plane and M-Plane traffic is protected by MACsec end-to-end between O-DU and O-RU. Fronthaul Transport Network Equipment (TNE) such as B1 or B2 in the above figure does not participate in MACsec. PTP remains unprotected by MACsec since PTP over MACsec would require MACsec to be hop by hop instead of end to end which can lead to two challenges – MACsec in each TNE in Fronthaul can cause more latency per TNE for any kind of traffic including latency sensitive C/U-Plane traffic and also such hop-by-hop deployment might be difficult. So PTP over MACsec is not recommended. PTP may use its own integrated security mechanism. However, if synchronization performance is guaranteed by any implementation, then MACsec as a security solution for PTP is not precluded in this topology.
MACsec in LLS-C3 topology running PTP G.8275.1 profile
Figure 4.6.3-1 C-Plane and M-Plane protection based on MACsec in LLS-C3 topology
In the case of LLS-C3 deployment all the discussions for LLS-C2 would also apply.
MACsec Solution Proposals for Fronthaul Security Protection
From the previous clauses, it is clear that while MACsec is a potential security solution for protection of C and U-Plane traffic, however, it is not recommended for PTP due to its implementation and deployment challenges.
This clause discusses potential solutions for O-DU and O-RU to keep PTP unprotected by MACsec whereas providing MACsec protection for other traffic. The solutions described in clause 4.6.4.2 allows to selectively filter out the S-Plane based on its EtherType and does not apply MACsec for S-Plane  traffic type, while C,U,M-Plane messages are encrypted using MACsec due to no differentiating factor of EtherType.
The deployment of MACsec in an end-to-end tunnel mode can be configured at various points within an Open Fronthaul network and is elucidated further in the below topology scenarios.
Deployment consideration for end-to end MACsec
Scenario 1: MACsec enabled at O-DU and O-RU
This option explores enabling MACsec at the O-RU and O-DU in an end-to-end tunnel mode, offering a secure communication pathway without requiring MACsec awareness in the transport network elements. The communication between the O-RU and O-DU is fortified with encryption, protecting against eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
This scenario is Zero Trust Architecture compliant from the Cell Site O-RU to the O-DU.
Figure 4.6.4.1.1-1 MACsec enabled at O-RU and O-DU
Scenario 2: MACsec enabled at the Transport Network elements at the edge of Cell site and Central Site
In this configuration, MACsec is activated on the edge transport network elements located at both the cell site and central site. The O-RU transmits unencrypted C-Plane messages to TNE1, where they are encrypted and subsequently tunneled to TNE2 at the central site.
This scenario is Zero Trust Architecture compliant from the Cell Site TNE1 to the TNE2.
Figure 4.6.4.1.2-1 MACsec enabled at edge Transport Network Elements
Scenario 3: MACsec enabled at the O-RU at Cell site and edge TNE at the Central Site
In this scenario, MACsec is activated on the O-RU located at the cell site, which is connected to a TNE. The end-to-end MACsec tunnel is established between the O-RU and TNE2 at the central site. The encrypted C-Plane traffic is then tunneled through the MACsec-unaware TNEs within the Open Fronthaul network.
This scenario is Zero Trust Architecture compliant from the Cell Site O-RU to the TNE2.
Figure 4.6.4.1.3-1 MACsec enabled at O-RU and TNE2
Scenario 4: MACsec enabled Cell site TNE and O-DU at the Central Site
In this scenario, MACsec is activated on the TNE1 located at the cell site. The end-to-end MACsec tunnel is established between the TNE1 and O-DU at the central site. The encrypted traffic is then tunneled through the MACsec-unaware TNEs within the Open Fronthaul network.
This scenario is Zero Trust Architecture compliant from the Cell Site TNE1 to the O-DU.
NOTE: When DU is hosted on the O-Cloud, MACsec termination will occur at the O-Cloud.
Figure 4.6.4.1.4-1 MACsec enabled at TNE1 and O-DU
Scenario 5: MACsec enabled at O-DU and O-RU
In this configuration, MACsec is activated on the O-RU and O-DU connection that is directly connected to each other with no transport network elements. The communication between the O-RU and O-DU is fortified with encryption, protecting against eavesdropping, and unauthorized access. This scenario is Zero Trust Architecture compliant from the Cell Site O-RU to the O-DU.
NOTE: Note: When DU is hosted on the O-Cloud, MACsec termination will occur at the O-Cloud.
Figure 4.6.4.1.5-1 MACsec enabled at O-DU and O-RU
Scenario 6: MACsec enabled at O-RU and TNE at the Central Site
In this configuration, MACsec is activated on the O-RU and TNE connection that is directly connected to each other with no transport network elements. The communication between the O-RU and TNE is fortified with encryption, protecting against eavesdropping, and unauthorized access. This scenario is Zero Trust architecture-compliant from the Cell Site O-RU to the TNE.
Figure 4.6.4.1.6-1 MACsec enabled at O-RU and TNE at the Central Site
Scenario 7: MACsec enabled at FHM and O-DU at the Central Site
In this configuration of Shared Cell, MACsec is activated on the FHM and O-DU that is directly connected to each other with no transport network elements. The communication between the FHM and O-DU is fortified with encryption, protecting against eavesdropping, and unauthorized access. This scenario is Zero Trust architecture-compliant from the Cell Site FHM to the O-DU.
NOTE: When DU is hosted on the O-Cloud, MACsec termination will occur at the O-Cloud.
Figure 4.6.4.1.7-1 MACsec enabled at FHM and O-DU at the Central Site
Scenario 8: MACsec enabled at TNE at Cell site and O-DU at the Central Site
In this configuration of Shared Cell, MACsec is activated on the TNE at cell-site and  O-DU at central site. The end-to-end MACsec tunnel is established between the TNE and O-DU at the central site. The encrypted traffic is then tunneled through the MACsec-unaware TNEs within the Open Fronthaul network.
This scenario is Zero Trust Architecture compliant from the Cell Site TNE to the O-DU.
NOTE: When DU is hosted on the O-Cloud, MACsec termination will occur at the O-Cloud.
Figure 4.6.4.1.8-1 MACsec enabled at FHM and O-DU at the Central Site
MACsec Solution Proposals for Fronthaul Security Protection
In the below solution, an end-to end MACsec tunnel is established between O-DU and O-RU for protecting all traffic except S-Plane. In clause 4.6.4.1 of the technical report , there are various network topologies described for implementing MACsec in an end-to end tunnel mode. The below solution involves EDE-CC, controlled port, uncontrolled port as functional blocks from IEEE 8021.AE[i.9] that can be integrated into O-DU, O-RU, TNE, FHM based on the MACsec tunnel endpoints.
Figure 4.6.4.2-1 MACsec solution proposal for fronthaul security protection
In this solution the concept of controlled port, uncontrolled port, and Ethernet Data Encryption (EDE) from IEEE 802.1AE standard for MACsec [i.9] are used as functional blocks integrated within O-DU or O-RU in same physical hardware. While transmitting, O-DU functional block sends PTP messages towards uncontrolled port whereas all other traffic towards controlled port. This demultiplexing operation can be done based upon checking PTP EtherType for G.8275.1 profile. PTP messages go out from the hardware port and remain unprotected by MACsec. All the other traffic goes through an EDE functional block which protects traffic using MACsec. In the above figure, an EDE-CC is depicted as it can put a cleartext VLAN header before MACsec header. This VLAN header contains VLAN as well as VLAN PCP bits which are used for VLAN-based switching and identifying QoS profile in the MACsec unaware Fronthaul TNE connected to O-DU. While receiving, O-RU maps PTP messages to uncontrolled port and all the other traffic to an EDE. Again, PTP EtherType can be used for this demultiplexing operation. Through uncontrolled port, PTP messages go to 1588 layer in O-RU functional block. All the other traffic which is received by EDE is validated using MACsec and upon successful validation sent towards O-RU functional block through controlled port. Communication from O-RU towards O-DU happens in a similar manner.
In addition to EDEs a similar solution to expose a VLAN header in clear text exists which many products on the market currently support. It is a non-standard addition to the IEEE Std 802.1AE, requiring the 802.1AE header to be inserted after the VLAN header(s). The industry refers to this mode as e.g. ‘WAN mode’, ‘VLAN in the clear' or ‘Bypassed Tags’. As support for EDEs at this time is low across the market, this mode should be proposed to be supported. The only difference to the EDE modes is that the receiver cannot check whether the VLAN header in front of the MACsec header has been altered, but in both cases the VLAN header in the clear is not protected until it reaches the receiver. So, an attacker can attack the network (frame routing and -scheduling) in both cases.

Annex B (informative):  Deployment consideration for encryption of C Plane messages in an Open Fronthaul network
The O-RAN 7.2x is a split 7 “Low Level Split” (LLS) that runs between the O-RU and the O-DU. In the O-RAN architecture, service providers possess the flexibility to determine the placement of network components. Deployment scenarios may involve collocating O-RUs and O-DUs at the cell site or placing O-RUs and O-DUs in two distinct geographical locations. The deployment scenarios drive the need for encryption of C-Plane over an Open Fronthaul network.
Deployment Scenario 1: Collocated O-RU and O-DU at Cell Site
In this deployment scenario the O-RU and O-DU are collocated at the cell-site in an LLS-C1 or LLS-C2 topology. The fronthaul network's entire infrastructure is confined within the secure perimeter of the cell site, the risks associated with data interception or tampering are substantially reduced as the adversary would need physical access to the cell site location. By considering the network architecture, and maintaining robust cell-site security, stakeholders can create a resilient fronthaul network infrastructure that effectively address external threats.
Although cell-site physical security prevents external threat, but it does not prevent an insider attack. The risk of insider attacks necessitates additional measures, such as the encryption of C-Plane messages, aligned with the principles of Zero Trust Architecture.
The need for encrypting C-Plane messages in this deployment scenario may be based on the operator choice of operational overload and network architecture, cell-site security.

Deployment Scenario 2: O-RU at Cell site and O-DU and O-CU at the Central site
In this deployment strategy, the O-RU is placed exclusively at the cell site, while the O-DU and O-CU is placed at a centralized location. The traffic from O-RU is transported over a switched fronthaul network.
The Fronthaul network consists of one or more number of switches and routers. The network path between the O-DU and O-RU are prone to threats as defined in clause 2.3.1.
Encryption for C-plane messages is recommended for this deployment scenario.
