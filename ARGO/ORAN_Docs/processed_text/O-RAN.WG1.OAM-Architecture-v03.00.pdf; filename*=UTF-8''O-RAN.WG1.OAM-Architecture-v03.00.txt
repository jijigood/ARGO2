Chapter 2.  O-RAN Overview 1
2.1 Scope and Objectives 2
O-RAN activities are guided by the following objectives [11]: 3
• Leading the industry towards open, interoperable interfaces, RAN virtualization, and big data and AI enabled RAN 4
intelligence. 5
• Maximizing the use of common-off-the-shelf hardware and merchant silicon and minimizing proprietary hardware 6
• Specifying APIs and interfaces, driving standards to adopt them as appropriate, and exploring open sourc e where 7
appropriate 8
The O-RAN OAM Architecture identifies management services, managed functions and managed elements supported 9
in O-RAN, including the interworking between service management and orchestration and other O -RAN components.  10
Requirements are derived from end-to-end OAM use cases, including the initial provisioning of O-RAN service across 11
VNFs and PNFs, and data collection from O-RAN Managed Elements and O-Cloud.  The architecture identifies the 12
interfaces between O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration and Managed Elements for different models and 13
example deployment options. 14
Future versions of the architecture will address additional areas of O-RAN OAM functionality. 15
2.2 End to End OAM Use Case 16
This section contains end to end OAM use cases that O-RAN is expected to support.  Requirements will be derived 17
from the use cases. 18
The initial use cases defined include O-RAN Service Provisioning and Data Collection.  Additional Use Cases will be 19
added as prioritized by the O-RAN community in future versions of this document 20
2.2.1 O-RAN Service Provisioning 21
2.2.1.1 Basic Objective 22
In the O-RAN architecture, the radio side includes Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU Managed 23
Functions, and the management side is comprised of the Service Management and Orchestration Framework (including 24
the Non-RT RIC). In the NFV environment, O-RAN network elements can also be implemented in a virtualized form, 25
and thus include an Infrastructure layer (e.g. COTS/White Box/Peripheral hardware  and virtualization layer) based on  26
an O-Cloud. 27
The current use case focuses on network/element deployment rather than physical construction. According to the radio 28
coverage requirement, operators could deploy the O-RAN network/element on dedicated physical resources and/or 29
virtualized resources in a specific area.  30
This use case assumes that the network elements are deployed based on an example Network Design using VNFs for 31
centralized functions and PNFs for functions closer to the customer, so that the sequence calls  for deployment of VNFs 32
for the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP first followed by PNFs for the O-DU and O-RU. Note: RF functions 33
must always be realized as PNFs but the O-DU can be realized as a PNF or VNF; this document uses PNF as an 34
example to illustrate the associated OAM flows. 35
It is also assumed that secure network connectivity is already available between RAN components.  36
2.2.1.2 Entities/Resources involved 37
To support the O-RAN network provisioning, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework needs t o support 38
the following capabilities: 39
• O-RAN network element deployed in selected area 40

Copyright © 2020 by the O-RAN Alliance e.V.  Your use is subject to the terms of the O-RAN Adopter License
Agreement in Annex ZZZ
 O-RAN.WG1.OAM-Architecture-v03.00
a) For non-virtualized parts, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework supports the deployment of 1
physical network elements on the target dedicated physical resources which satisfy the coverage 2
requirements, with management through the O1 interface.  3
b) For virtualized network elements, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework has the capability 4
to interact with the O-Cloud to perform network element life cycle management, e.g. instantiate the 5
virtualized network element on the target infrastructure through the O2 interface (e.g., indicate the selected 6
geo-location for each VNF to be instantiated, where close to the PNFs).  7
c) The Service Management and Orchestration Framework has the capability to consume the provisioning 8
management service through the O1 interface to manage the configuration of the network element, details are 9
defined in O-RAN.WG1.OAM Interface Specification [13]. 10
• O-RAN network provisioning 11
a) Based on the deployed network elements, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework configures 12
the IP addressing, etc. in the PNFs and VNFs to support connectivity between them (this operation could also 13
be performed during the instantiation steps). 14
b) Operators can operate and maintain the network dynamically through the O1 and/or O2 interface by means 15
of: 16
i. Reconfiguration of the network elements 17
ii. System update (usually refers to software management, without adding network elements) and system 18
upgrade (the network elements could be added/removed/modified) 19
According to above, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework together with the O-Cloud implements the 20
O-RAN network element deployment and provisioning, creating an O-RAN network to provide service to consumers.  21
Note: The O2 interface will be defined in more detail in future O-RAN Orchestration specifications. 22
2.2.1.3 Solutions 23
Table 2.2.1-1 shows the O-RAN service provisioning procedures. 24

2.2.2 O-RAN Measurement Data Collection 4
2.2.2.1 Basic Objective 5
In O-RAN architecture, the Non-RT RIC as the intelligent management center located in Service Management and 6
Orchestration Framework could request the SMO to collect measurement data from network for AI/ML 7
training/inference/analyzing, and then generate optimization operations which could improve the end- to-end user 8
service experience and the network performance.  9
According to the Service Management and Orchestration Framework, to fulfill the Non -RT RIC requested data 10
collection, the following capability should be supported by the SMO (framework): 11

 O-RAN.WG1.OAM-Architecture-v03.00
i The SMO should support the MnS component Type A (defined in [6])generation and the corresponding 1
operation performing (defined in [5] and [7]), according to the measurement data collection request from the 2
Non-RT RIC 3
ii The SMO (framework) should support the MnS component type C (defined in [6]) consumption such as the 4
measurement data requested by the Non-RT RIC 5
The current use case focuses on the Non-RT RIC requested measurement data collection and consumption, the SMO 6
should generate the PM Job and perform the PM Job control operations accordingly, and the SMO (framework) should 7
support the measurement data consumption by the Non-RT RIC. 8
Notes: 9
i In the O-RAN SMO framework, in order to avoid the PM Job confliction, it is suggested that the SMO take the 10
responsibility for generating the PM Job and performing the PM Job control related operations. The resolution of 11
conflict resolving by the SMO is FFS. 12
ii In this use case, the network elements decide if the PM Job is acceptable or not, in other words, it is ultimately the 13
network element (MnS producer) who decides whether the measurement data collection task can be established or 14
not. 15
iii Specifications for collecting infrastructure measurements do not yet exist. The Meas urement Data Collection 16
procedures will be updated to comply with [15] once WG6 has published the specification.  17
iv The measurement data producer in the use case so far doesn’t refer to Network Slicing, but this will be added in 18
the use case once the O-RAN network slice has been defined. 19
 20
2.2.2.2 Entities/Resources involved 21
• Roles in the PM Job Control related operations:  22
a). The Non-RT RIC: PM Job initiator 23
b). The SMO (framework): measurement service component type A consumer  24
To fulfill the Non-RT RIC requested measurement data collection by the SMO on the O1/O2 interface, the information 25
related to the collection task should comply with section2.3 defined in [13].  26
The measurement data collection information provided by the Non-RT RIC should be converted into a PM Job, and any 27
management operations to the data collection task requested by the Non-RT RIC should be converted into the O1/O2 28
interface supported PM Job control related management service operations by the SMO.  29
• Roles in the NotifyFileReady subscribing: 30
a). SMO: management service component type A consumer (the referenceConsumer, defined in [5])  31
b). O-RAN MOs: Notification producer 32
• Roles in the measurement data consumption: 33
a). SMO: management service component type C consumer 34
b). O-RAN MOs: streaming data producer 35
c). File Server: storage the measurement data file 36

3.1 Architectural Principles 3
The following section provides architecture principals guiding the support of OAM in the O -RAN architecture. 4
Common OAM functions should be supported through a common set of OAM interface protocols across the differe nt 5
components of the O-RAN architecture 6
Management Services should, to the degree possible, align with existing standards specifications:  7
• 3GPP 5G Specifications for management interfaces 8
• ETSI NFV Specifications for life cycle management 9
• O-RAN WG4.MP.0-v01.00 (Future enhancements to align to 3GPP can be considered.)   10
O-RAN OAM specifications should refer to the 3GPP and ETSI specs and not replicate them here.  O -RAN OAM 11
specifications must identify needed extensions to support O-RAN and exceptions which cannot be supported.  It is the 12
goal of O-RAN to drive any needed extensions into standards to maintain alignment between O-RAN and existing 13
standards. 14
3.2 Architecture Requirements 15
Defines the Architecture requirements applicable to the O-RAN reference architecture.  Architecture requirements are 16
derived from Use Cases to be supported and define the functional needs the architecture aims to satisfy.  17
The initial set of requirements in this document are derived from the O-RAN Service Provisioning Use Case.  More 18
requirements may be added in future versions of the OAM Architecture. 19

3.3.1 Architectural Building Blocks 1
3.3.1.1 Management Services 2
Management Services offer capabilities to manage and orchestrate managed elements.   Managed elements expose their 3
management services to managers.  Managers consume the management services.  4
Examples of Management Services supported by O-RAN include: 5
• Provisioning 6
• Fault Supervision 7
• Performance Assurance 8
• Trace Management 9
• File Management 10
• Software Management 11
• Communication Surveillance 12
• Startup and Registration of a Physical Network Function (PNF) 13
• Instantiation and Termination of a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) 14
• Scaling Management Services for VNF 15
'The definition of supported management services and their APIs will be covered in the OAM O1 Interface specification  16
[13]. 17
3.3.1.2 Managed Functions 18
The definition of a Managed Function (MF) is given in 3GPP TS 28.622 [3] section 4.3.4.  An MF instance is managed 19
using the management interface(s) exposed by its containing ME instance. 20
O-RAN managed functions include: 21
• Near-Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) 22
• O-RAN Central Unit – Control Plane (O-CU-CP) 23
• O-RAN Central Unit – User Plane (O-CU-UP) 24
• O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU) 25
• O-RAN Radio Unit (O-RU) 26
 27
3.3.1.3 Managed Elements 28
The definition of a Managed Element (ME) is given in 3GPP TS 28.622 [3] section 4.3.3.  The ME supports 29
communication over management interface(s) to the manager for purposes of control and monitoring.  30
Examples of O-RAN Managed Elements include: 31
• O-RAN Managed Functions deployed individually as MEs (e.g., Near -RT RIC ME, O-CU-CP ME, O-CU-UP 32
ME, O-DU ME, O-RU ME). 33
• Central Unit (CU) composed of O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP  34
• ME composed of Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU  35

 O-RAN.WG1.OAM-Architecture-v03.00
A variety of deployment examples and their OAM interfaces are given in a later section. Choice of deployment options 1
will be based on operator requirements. 2
A key motivation for the Managed Element concept is that an ME is a tightly integrated and tested group of MFs that 3
are deployed together.  This has implications on how software updates are managed, because all software updates need 4
to retain the property that all MFs in the ME have been tested together.  Depending on the deployment scenario and 5
other considerations, the MFs may be grouped in different ways.  An interface is required to each ME, which can 6
manage the communications to each MF that is contained within it.  Following sections present many examples of how 7
the O1 interface can connect to either an ME that contains an individual MF, or to an integrated ME that contains 8
multiple MFs. 9
3.3.1.4 Service Management and Orchestration Framework 10
Service Management and Orchestration Framework is responsible for the management and orchestration of the 11
managed elements under its span of control.  The framework can for example be a third- party Network Management 12
System (NMS) or orchestration platform. 13
Service Management and Orchestration Framework must provide an integration fabric and data services for the 14
managed functions.  The integration fabric enables interoperation and communication between managed functions 15
within the O-RAN domain.  Data services provide efficient data collection, storage and movement capabilities for the 16
managed functions.  In order to implement multiple OAM architecture options together with RAN service modeling, the 17
modeling of different OAM deployment options and OAM services (integration fabric etc.) must be supported by SMO  18
3.3.1.5 Non-Real Time Radio Intelligent Controller  19
The non-RT RIC is a part of the Service Management & Orchestration Framework and communicates to the near -RT 20
RIC using the A1 interface. [17]  21
Non-RT control functionality (> 1s) and near-Real Time (near-RT) control functions (< 1s) are decoupled in the RIC. 22
Non-RT functions include service and policy management, RAN analytics and model-training for some of the near-RT 23
RIC functionality, and non-RT RIC optimization.  24
3.3.1.6 Control Loop Support 25
O-RAN defines 3 control loops with different latency bands [17]. It is not expected that these loops are hierarchical but 26
instead run in parallel. This does not mean that an ME with an inner loop will not generat e its own event as result of an 27
inner loop failure, but it will not simply propagate the lower level event received by the inner loop. The three loops are 28
roughly defined as: 29
- Loop 1: In the DU for per TTI/msec resource scheduling (<10 millisecond) 30
- Loop 2: In the Near-RT RIC and CU for resource optimization (10 milliseconds to 1 second) 31
- Loop 3: In the Service Management and Orchestration Framework for ML Training, Trending, Orchestration (> 32
1 second) 33

3.3.2 Basic OAM Architecture  1
 2
Figure 3.3.2-1 O-RAN OAM Logical Architecture 3
Figure 3.3.2-1 shows the overall O-RAN OAM Logical Architecture.  In the original white paper [11], the interface 4
between the Manager and the O-RAN components for control purposes was identified as A1.  The O-RAN OAM 5
Architecture adds another interface for OAM functions, labeled O1 (OAM). O1 is the interface between the O -RAN 6
Managed Element and the management entity.  Note: the figure uses 5G terminology, however the same pri nciples will 7
apply for LTE/4G.  Mapping to LTE/4G may be added in future.  Also, the O2 interface for management of the O -8
Cloud may have requirements that differ from the other O1 interfaces and requires further study.  The green boxes 9
together comprise the Cloud Platform Infrastructure shown in Figure 3.3.2-1. 10
The O1 OAM Interface includes implementation of Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security (FCAPS) 11
functions, File management and software management functions to ME (s) virtualized and physical alike. In the case of 12
virtualized Network Elements (NEs), the interface describes standardized interfaces for orchestration and monitoring of 13
the infrastructure resource used to deploy the software as a separate entity. In the case of pure monolit hic architectures 14
with fully integrated hardware and software, the hardware is reported with the software.  For details of the management 15
services supported by O1, see [13]. 16
As shown in the figure, there is a logical OAM interface to individual O-RAN Managed Functions, however in practice 17
the grouping of Managed Functions into Managed Elements will determine where actual O1 interfaces are terminated.  18
More detail is explained in subsequent sections.  The O1 interface could be the terminated directly on the Service 19
Management & Orchestration Framework or in a hierarchical model could be terminated on a Managed Element which 20
manages other O-RAN Managed Functions.  21
The sections below identify possible management topologies, for example, the basic “flat” model o f OAM relationships 22
as well as the hierarchical model of O-DU to O-RU relationship and the hybrid model of O-DU to O-RU relationship 23
defined in the O-RAN Front Haul M-Plane specification, as well as example deployment options. 24
3.3.3 OAM Models and Deployment Options 25
This section provides examples of possible models and deployments of Managed Functions into Managed Elements.  26
Adoption of a single model is not required in the O-RAN OAM Architecture, rather multiple model deployments may 27
be supported in a network. 28

3.3.3.1 Flat Management Architecture Model 1
 2
Figure 3.3.3-1: Flat Model 3
In the Flat management model, all the MFs comprising the O-RAN architecture are also MEs and expose an O1 4
interface to the SMO. Note: The Open Front Haul M-Plane specification is not currently optimized to support flat 5
management of the O-RU and this is for further study. 6
NM/orchestration platforms provide a distributed deployment model of NM functions which allows for greater scaling 7
and lower latency functions that traditional centralized monolithic NM implementations. In this specification, no 8
specific platform is required, however the NM is assumed to have orchestration capabilities. Therefore, deployment of 9
SMOs, analytics, configuration and control functions can be potentially collocated wi th some of the NEs. This allows 10
for localized processing and localized scaling to handle the expected large number of NEs to be managed. The NM 11
functions can be distributed across the network edge and therefore handle a logically flat architecture. Additionally, the 12
NM architectures supports low latency measurement collection, processing, and delivery to the RIC as a form of policy 13
guidance or data update. 14
3.3.3.2 Hierarchical Management Architecture Model 15
Where the distributed NM architecture is not available it may be desirable to deploy a hierarchical management 16
architecture where a higher level ME is used to manage a subnetwork of MEs as shown in Figure 3.3.3- 2, where the O-17
DU manages the O-RU using the Open Front Haul M-Plane interface. 18
 19
Figure 3.3.3-2: Hierarchical Model Example 20
In the example of the figure 3.3.3-2, the O-RU is managed by the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface to the O-DU rather 21
than the Service Management & Orchestration Framework, so there is a hierarchical relationship between Service 22
Management & Orchestration and the O-DU.  The O-DU must provide a consistent and standardized view of the 23
subtending O-RUs as specified above. 24

3.3.3.3 Hybrid Management Architecture Model 1
In the Hybrid management architecture, the O-RU is managed partially by the O-DU and partially by the SMO. 2
The management by O-DU is via the Open Fronthaul M-Plane, and the SMO manages the O-RU through the O1 3
interface. 4
 5
Figure 2.3.3-3: Hybrid Model  6
Management responsibility is divided in this case between the O-DU and the Service Management & Orchestration 7
Framework.  Open Fronthaul M-Plane in the figure is defined in [12] interface. The O-RU supports connection to 8
multiple clients as well as access control that can be used to control the privileges available to a particular client in 9
Open Fronthaul M-Plane [12]. Not shown in this figure, an Open Front Haul M-Plane interface between the O-RU and 10
the NMS which is optionally supported by SMO for backward compatibility is specified in [17]. The alignment between 11
the Open Fronthaul M-Plane and O1 interfaces is for further study. 12
3.3.3.4 Example Managed Deployment Options 13
In aggregated equipment, the Managed Element contains multiple internal Managed Functions.  This section provides a 14
number of examples showing how the OAM architecture is applied to different groupings of Managed Functions into 15
Managed Elements.  Use cases associated with different deployment options are defined in [15].  16
Figure 3.3.3-4 shows a single Managed Element that contains O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU Managed 17
Functions. 18
 19
Figure 3.3.3-4: Example with Single Integrated ME 20
As shown in the figure 3.3.3-4, there is a single O1 interface to the Managed Element.  However, the O1 interface still 21
provides a consistent and standardized view of the Managed Functions that are contained within the Managed Element. 22

Figure 3.3.3-5 shows another example where the Near-RT RIC has been split off as a standalone ME. 1
 2
Figure 3.3.3-5: Example with Single Integrated ME + Standalone Near-RT RIC 3
In the example of Figure 3.3.3-5, there are separate O1 interfaces supported by each ME.  The ME containing the Near -4
RT RIC Managed Function supports management of only this function through its O1 interface, while the ME 5
containing the other Managed Functions provides a view of all contained functions.  6
 7
Figure 3.3.3-6: Example ME aggregating Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP 8
Figure 3.3.3-6 shows an alternative example with two Managed Elements containing the Near-RT RIC/O-CU-CP/O-9
CU-UP, and the O-DU and O-RU Managed Functions, respectively.  Again, the O1 interfaces from the MEs provide a 10
consistent and standardized view of the contained Managed Functions. 11

Figure 3.3.3-7 shows an alternative example with three Managed Elements containing the Near-RT RIC/O-CU-CP, the 1
CU-UP, and the O-DU and O-RU Managed Functions, respectively.  Again, the O1 interfaces from the MEs provide a 2
consistent and standardized view of the contained Managed Functions. 3
Finally, Figure 3.3.3-8 shows a similar grouping of Managed Functions, but with the Near-RT RIC separated as its own 4
Managed Element.  The same architectural concepts apply. 5

3.3.4 Managed Elements Deployed behind a NAT 8
Service Providers prefer to not deploy Managed Elements (ME) behind a NAT, but there are cases where this cannot be 9
avoided, for example:  10
• exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses 11
• managed elements deployed in large complexes not owned by the Service Provider (Apartments, Sports 12
Venues etc.) 13
• managed elements connected via third-party networks using a NAT 14
 15
When a Service Provider deploys managed elements behind a NAT it is critical that they are able to retain full 16
management control of these elements. 17
  18
  19
Figure 3.3.4.1 O-RAN MEs behind a NAT 20
  21
Four methods of providing the O-RAN Manager with the ability to address a ME behind a NAT and identify data 22
received from a ME behind a NAT are recommended in priority order: 23

1. ME uses IPv6 as Backhaul transport where possible eliminating the need for a NAT - exhaustion of public 1
IPv4 addresses 2
2. ME establishes persistent VPN tunnel (e.g. IPSec) toward a VPN concentrator (gateway) located outside of 3
network with the NAT.  The ME is then accessible through the established tunnel. 4
3. ME uses a standard protocol (UPNP or PCP) to establish a port-forwarding rule at the firewall and 5
automatically assign itself a port. 6
4. Service Provider manually configures the firewall to assign a port to each ME that resides within the protected 7
network. 8

Appendix A: Cardinality 1
This informative Appendix provides background information regarding the cardinality of different O -RAN architecture 2
elements.  It is not intended as a requirement on cardinality.   3
The RAN network has an expected hierarchical fan out. Therefore, the O -RAN sizing would be: 4
- Non-RT RIC (1..j) 5
- Near-RT RIC (1..k) 6
- O-CU-CP (1..m) 7
- O-CU-UP (1..n) 8
- O-DU (1..p) 9
- O-RU (1..q) 10
Where: 1<=j; j<=k; k<=m; m<=n; m<=p; p<=q 11
Due to resiliency and scaling aspects of cloud implementations an O-DU will logically be connected to one CU-CP. The 12
O-CU-CP may in fact be a pool of O-CU-CP instances to handle loads. 13
O-CU-UP MEs will be pooled and aligned with the services they are configured to serve. The O-CU-CP will assign the 14
O-CU-UP that an O-DU needs to connect to for a given UE session. 15
An O-DU may serve many O-RU MEs depending on its designed capacity to manage the loop 1 processing.  16
One Near-RT RIC will be connected to multiple O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU MEs. For resiliency the MEs may be 17
connected to more than one Near-RT RIC, however, it shall not require duplication of data to be sent to each RIC 18
instance. 19
A Near-RT RIC will be connected to one non-RT RIC. 20

As described in the O-Ran Architecture Description [17] the Cloud platform has two roles. These are depicted by the 4
end points in the O-Cloud Management and Control Planes. The Infrastructure Management Services (IMS) provides 5
management of the O-Cloud as a platform. The Deployment Management Services (DMS) provides management of 6
Deployments using the O-Cloud resources. Like in the SMO the internal software modules and components to the O -7
Cloud can vary from implementation to implementation. Therefore it is not advised to add additional entities unless it is 8
unavoidable for the use case. The color “#lightseagreen” has been identified as the background for this group of use 9

B.12 Grouping and References 17
Grouping can be used for many different aspects. In UML there are many types of groups. PlantUML support the basic 18
three. Any of the group types can be nested. “Alt” for conditional processing which can show different path processing 19
rather than just a sunny day scenario. It can also be used to show any logical, as the condition is stated in the swim lane, 20
processing. Sometimes the message and the grouping boundary are close and need some separation. Use the “|||” to 21
create that space. 22
The “loop” group is used to show iterations or conditional loops. The loop condition is stated on the lines and contain 23
the statements within the loop. 24
The last kind of group is the fragment. This is a logic group of a sequence of events that go together. The tag li ne at the 25
top describes the group. 26
Although references look like groups they cannot be nested. Use the single line version for references to use cases in the 27
current document. The Multi-Line version should be used for reference to use cases in an external document.  28

Annex A: SMO and Non-RT RIC mapping with 3GPP management 1
system 2
This section shows the SMO, Non-RT RIC and the related management interface/service mapping with 3GPP 3
management system.  4
In [9], 3GPP defines the network management and orchestration architecture for 3GPP networks including network slicing. 5
The management data analytic function (MDAF) is identified as the key function to enable the intelligent management of 6
the network, which provide s management data analytics service (MDAS) to both the management functions and the 7
network element. Meanwhile, intent driven management service (IDMS) is under discussion in 3GPP SA5, where the 8
management system could generate intent as the target of the network optimization and automation. T he management 9
system should have the capability to consume the service (IDMS) provided by the network. Currently, the two studies are 10
mainly to enable the network management automaton and intelligence. In this sense, it is quite aligned with the motivation 11
of introducing Non-RT RIC in O-RAN. 12
To better understand the O-RAN OAM architecture, the management services defined in O-RAN, and the relationship 13
with 3GPP and the potential gaps between 3GPP and O-RAN.  Fig. A-1 below tries to do some mapping between the 14
SMO, Non-RT RIC and 3GPP management system and interfaces with the following preliminary analysis.  15
1. A1 interface is closely related to the current SA5 3GPP IDMS and MDAS study.  16
(1) A1-P, as declarative policy is closely related to Intent-NOP discussed in IDMS. Performance target is 17
expected to be provided by management system via the IDMS. But only system level targets are being 18
discussed in the IDMS study. A1-P is finer granularity to enable the UE level, group UE level and even 19
application level automation and optimization. 20
(2) A1-EI/ML is closely related to the 3GPP MDAS study. MDAS provider is expected to provide data analytics 21
reports and recommendations to the consumers, e.g., CN or RAN leveraging the data analytics and ma chine 22
learning technologies. AI-EI/ML studied in O-RAN is to enable the enrichment information communication 23
and ML model management towards the RAN. The enrichment information may come from the data 24
analytics based on the historical RAN data collected over O1 interface or from RAN external data sources. In 25
this sense, A1-EI/ML has a larger scope than the MDAS in 3GPP.  26
2. O1 interface reflects the 3GPP traditional FCAPS management services. 27
3. O2 interface perform the O-Cloud management, the mapping with 3GPP is FFS. 28
4. Non-RT RIC could be seen as a MDAF instance, which provides management data analytic service to both internal 29
functions reside in the SMO and external consumers such as near-RT RIC. 30
The management service, Non-RT RIC and A1 work in O-RAN will continue evolve and the MDAS/IDMS related SI/WI 31
are under study and still in early stage in 3GPP. The gap analysis and mapping relationship will be continuously updated 32
based on the latest progress.  33

i. The figure shows the entire services provided by the SMO Framework, the O-Cloud management and Integration 2
fabric and data service defined by O-RAN so far there is no corresponding services defined in 3GPP. 3
ii. The Security management service and Accounting management defined in 3GPP so far they are not used in OAM 4
Functions. 5
iii. The A1 Policy management, A1 EI management, A1 ML management are being studied in O-RAN and being 6
implemented in O-RAN software community. 7
iv. The A1 Policy management maps to 3GPP IDMS. 8
v. A1 EI management and A1 ML management is correlated to the MDAS, when the EI is retrieved from the Data 9
Analytic and AI/ML Model Training, the concrete mapping relationship with 3GPP is FFS. 10
vi. The Data Analytics and AI/ML Model Training studied in O-RAN maps to 3GPP RAN domain MDAS producer. 11

Annex ZZZ : O-RAN Adopter License Agreement 1
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O- RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER 2
AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 3
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O -RAN Alliance and the 4
entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”). 5
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification. 6
Section 1: DEFINITIONS 7
1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with 8
another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of 9
fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity. 10
1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether impl emented in hardware, 11
software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification. 12
1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their 13
Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications. 14
1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does 15
not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of a n O-RAN 16
Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates. 17
1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design 18
patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable by a Member, 19
Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) 20
such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment of 21
consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering 22
any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possibl e 23
on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art 24
generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O -RAN Alliance or the date the patent 25
claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate 26
a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a 27
Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent 28
claims shall be considered Necessary Claims. 29
1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, 30
Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term 31
allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the 32
licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates. 33
Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE 34
2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, 35
nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN 36
Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in 37
furtherance of implementations of an O-RAN 38
Specification. 39
2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written 40
agreement with O-RAN Alliance. 41
Section 3: FRAND LICENSE 42

Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non - Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and 44
conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to 45
Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, 46
use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such 47
license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated 48
that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal 49
