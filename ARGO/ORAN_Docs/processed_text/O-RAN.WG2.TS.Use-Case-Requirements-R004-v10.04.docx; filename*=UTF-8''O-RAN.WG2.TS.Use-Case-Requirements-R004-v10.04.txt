4	Use cases

4.1	Traffic steering

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for traffic steering use case, allowing operators to specify different objectives for traffic management such as optimizing the network/UE performance, or achieving balanced cell load.

4.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

5G systems will support many different combinations of access technologies namely; LTE (licensed band), NR (licensed band), NR-U (unlicensed band), Wi-Fi (unlicensed band). Several different multi-access deployment scenarios are possible with 5GC to support wide variety of applications and satisfy the spectrum requirements of different service providers;

Carrier aggregation between licensed band NR (primary cell) and NR-U (secondary cell)

Dual connectivity between licensed band NR (primary cell) and NR-U (secondary cell)

Dual connectivity between licensed band LTE (primary cell) and NR-U (secondary cell)

The rapid traffic growth and multiple frequency bands utilized in a commercial network make it challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution. Further in a multi-access system there is need to switch the traffic across access technologies based on changes in radio environment and application requirements and even split the traffic across multiple access technologies to satisfy performance requirements. The different types of traffic and frequency bands in a commercial network make it challenging to handle the complex QoS aspects, bearer selection (Master Cell Group (MCG) bearer, Secondary Cell Group (SCG) bearer, split bearer), bearer type change for load balancing, achieving low latency and best in class throughput in a multi-access scenario with 5GC networks (as specified in 3GPP TS 37.340 [8]). Typical controls are limited to adjusting the cell reselection and handover parameters; modifying load calculations and cell priorities; and are largely static in nature when selecting the type of bearers and QoS attributes.

Further, the RRM (Radio Resource Management) features in the existing cellular network are either cell-centric or UE-centric. Even in different areas within a cell, there are variations in radio environment, such as neighboring cell coverage, signal strength, interference status, etc. However, base stations based on traditional control strategies treat all UEs in a similar way and both cell- and UE-centric algorithms do exist.

Such current solutions suffer from following limitations:

1) It is hard to adapt the RRM control to diversified scenarios and optimization objectives.

2) The traffic management strategy is usually passive, rarely taking advantage of capabilities to predict network and UE performance. The strategy needs to consider aspects of steering, switching and splitting traffic across different access technologies in a multi-access scenario.

3) Non-optimal traffic management, with slow response time, due to various factors such as inability to select the right set of UEs for control action. This further results in non-optimal system and UE performance, such as suboptimal spectrum utilization, reduced throughput and increased handover failures.

Based on the above reasons, the main objective of this use case is to allow operators to flexibly configure the desired optimization policies, utilize the right performance criteria, and leverage machine learning to enable intelligent and proactive traffic management.

4.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

SMO (including Non-RT RIC):

Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data for defining and updating policies to guide the behavior of traffic management function in Near-RT RIC. For example, the policy could relate to specifying different optimization objectives to guide the carrier/band preferences at per-UE or group of UE granularity.

Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data for performing data statistical analysis that will provide enrichment information for Near-RT RIC to assist in the traffic steering function. For example, this could be an analysis method to construct radio fingerprint based on UE measurement report with RSRP/RSRQ/CQI information for serving and neighbouring cells.

Support communication of policies to Near-RT RIC.

Support communication of measurement configuration parameters to RAN nodes.

Support communication of enrichment information to Near-RT RIC, e.g., radio fingerprint information, etc.

Near-RT RIC:

Support interpretation and enforcement of policies from Non-RT RIC.

Support using enrichment information to optimize control function, e.g., Near-RT RIC can use radio finger print to directly predict the inter-frequency cell measurement based on the intra-frequency cell measurement result to speed up the traffic steering with much reduced signaling overhead.

E2 nodes:

Support data collection with required granularity to SMO over O1 interface.

An example scenario is here used to describe the use of A1 for traffic management, implying the Non-RT RIC sending policies for allocation of the control plane (RRC) and the user plane for different services, identified by their 5QI.

In the scenario a UE with UEid=1, belonging to a subnet slice identified by S-NSSAI=1, having a voice (5QI=1) and an MBB (5QI=9) connection established, enters an area covered by four frequency bands. The Non-RT RIC understands the requirements and characteristics of the services and decides to let the voice and RRC connection reside on the low band (here covered by a macro cell B becoming the PCell), while the MBB connection should preferably use the higher band (here provided by a smaller cell C and D becoming the SCells) and avoid the low band if possible. Cell A is used for MBB if required for coverage reasons.

Policies are sent to any cell of concern, e.g., where the UE resides and can move.

The desired use of the cells is shown in figure 4.1.5-1.

Figure 4.1.5-1: Desired use of the cells

Two policies over A1 are needed to accomplish the desired behavior, described in JSON format below. Note that as part of the scope, the cell_id is optional, and if omitted it is up to the Near-RT RIC to locate the UE and there enforce the policy.

{

    "policy_id": "1",

    "scope": {

      "ue_id": "1",

      "slice_id": "1",

      "qos_id": "1",

		“cell_id”: ”X”	// Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    "statement": {

      "cell_id_list": "B",

      "preference": "Shall",

      "primary": true	// Control plane on Cell B (becoming PCell)

    },

    "statement": {

      "cell_id_list ": "B",

      "preference": "Shall",

      "primary": true	// Voice on Cell B

    }

}

{

    "policy_id": "2",

    "scope": {

      "ue_id": "1",

      "slice_id": "1",

      "qos_id": "9",

		“cell_id”: ”X”	// Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    "statement": {

      "cell_id_list ": {"B", “A”},

      "preference": "Avoid",

      "primary": false	// Avoid MBB on Cell A and Cell B

    },

    "statement": {

      "cell_id_list": {“C”, “D”},

      "preference": "Prefer",

      "primary": false	// Prefer MBB on Cell C and Cell D

    }

}

Besides the cell level preference policy, there are also carrier level preference policy for the traffic steering use case. Taking the above scenario as an example, the UE with UEid=1, belonging to a subnet slice identified by S-NSSAI=1, having a voice (5QI=1) and an MBB (5QI=9) connection established, enters the area covered by four cells identified by cell A, cell B, cell C and cell D, respectively.

Assuming that cell A and cell B work on the same frequency carrier  which can be identified by Arfcn_1,  cell C and cell D work on the same frequency carrier which can be identified by Arfcn_2. Carrier Arfcn_1 is in low frequency and have narrow bandwidth and adapt to voice (5QI=1) connection. Carrier Arfcn_2 is in high frequency and have wide bandwidth and adapt to MBB (5QI=9) connection, meanwhile, avoid connection to the low frequency bands.

The following policies are needed to accomplish this as described in JSON format below.

{

    "policy_id": "1",

    "scope": {

      "ue_id": "1",

      "slice_id": "1",

      "qos_id": "1",

		“cell_id”: ”X”	// Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    "statement": {

      "carrier_id_list": "Arfcn_1",

      "preference": "Prefer",

      "primary": true	// Control plane on Carrier Arfcn_1 (becoming Primary Component Carrier)

    },

}

{

    "policy_id": "2",

    "scope": {

      "ue_id": "1",

      "slice_id": "1",

      "qos_id": "9",

		“cell_id”: ”X”	// Policy for Cell X, where X is one of A, B, C or D

    },

    "statement": {

      "carrier_id_list ": "Arfcn_1",

      "preference": "Avoid",

      "primary": false	// Avoid MBB on Carrier Arfcn_1, and no carrier in the carrier_id_list is to be used as secondary component carrier. That is said, Arfcn_1 is not used as secondary component carrier, because it is already used for primary component carrier as the policy 1 stated.

    },

    "statement": {

      "carrier_id_list": “Arfcn_2”,

      "preference": "Prefer",

      "primary": false	// Prefer MBB on Carrier Arfcn_2, and Arfcn_2 is used as secondary component carrier

    }

}

4.1.6	Enrichment information example

Radio fingerprint is composed of multiple virtual grids. The virtual grids are constructed based on the historical report of intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurement results of UEs from both the serving cell and the neighbor cell. The serving cell is divided into multiple grids according to the signaling measurement difference. It can be seen as a kind of different space partition method which is different with the traditional space partition method based on geographical location. To construct the radio fingerprint, the grid index and the grid attributes need to be defined. The grid index is to identify a specific virtual grid and this index consists of cell ID and corresponding coverage quality, e.g., RSRP segment ID, of at least three intra-frequency cells. The grid attributes are used to describe the wireless characteristics of the grid, such as coverage of inter-frequency neighbor cells, including RSRP, Reference Signal Receiving Quality (RSRQ), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), beam ID, etc., handover performance indicators, and so on. The virtual grids of the radio fingerprint are shown in figure 4.1.6-1.

4.1.7	A1 usage example in multi-access environment

The Non-RT RIC can send policies for traffic distribution in a multi-access environment based on UE characteristics and traffic patterns for different services that can be identified by their 5QI. The following example scenario illustrates this, in which there are three UEs with the following characteristics.

UE Identifier

UE Id=1, S-NSSAI =1

UE Id=2, S-NSSAI =2

UE Id=3, S-NSSAI =3

User Traffic

5QI=1: Voice

5QI=8: FTP, Email

5QI=1: Voice

5QI=8: Email

5QI=83: Advanced driving

5QI=1: Voice

5QI=8: Progressive video

5QI=8: File sharing

Mobility Pattern

Stationary

High mobility

Low mobility

The UEs are in an area covered by three frequency bands identified by cell A, cell B and cell C respectively. Cell A is the macro licensed cell with the best coverage. Cell B is the unlicensed cell with limited coverage and cell C is a licensed cell with narrow bandwidth but provides greater coverage area than cell B.

The cell layout for multi-access use case is shown in figure 4.1.7-1.

Figure 4.1.7-1: Cell layout for multi-access use case

From a traffic distribution perspective, since UE with UE Id=1 is a stationary UE the FTP and email traffic with (5QI=8) should preferably be routed over secondary unlicensed cell B and should avoid licensed cells, cell A and cell C. The voice traffic should be routed over cell A.

For UE with UE Id=2, since it is a highly mobile UE, all the traffic should be routed over licensed cells, preferably cell A to avoid disruption in connections. However, if there is a shortage of bandwidth in cell A, the email traffic (5QI=8) can be routed over unlicensed band (cell B). Given that this is a high mobility UE, there can be a policy that a minimum of 50% and maximum of 70% of all traffic from this UE should be routed over cell A which should be the primary cell and remaining can be routed over secondary cell.

For UE with UE Id=3, since it is a low mobility UE both the progressive video (5QI=8) and file sharing (5QI=8) should be routed over unlicensed band (cell B). The voice traffic should be routed over cell A.

The following policies are needed to accomplish this as described in JSON format below.

Policy Id 1: For group of UEs with UE Id, 1, 2 and 3. It sets the preference for voice traffic (5QI=1) on cell A for all the UEs. Further, dual connectivity should be enabled for all these UEs whenever possible.

Policy Id 2: For group of UEs with UE Id, 1 and 3. It sets the preference for all traffic with (5QI=8) on cell B for both the UEs and also avoids cell A and cell C for routing this traffic.

Policy Id 3: For UE with UE Id=2. It sets the preference for advanced driving traffic with (5QI=83) on cell A and C and also avoids cell B for routing this traffic.

Policy Id 4: For UE with UE Id=2. It sets the preference for email traffic with (5QI=8) on cell A and C for the high mobility UE. However, it does not avoid use of cell B for routing this traffic in case of bandwidth limitation.

Policy Id 5: For UE with UE Id=2. It sets the preference that minimum of 50% and a maximum of 70% of all traffic from this UE should be routed through cell A for this UE.

4.2	QoE optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support real-time QoE optimization. Moreover, some high-level description and requirements over Non-RT RIC, A1 and E2 interfaces are introduced.

4.2.1	Background and goal of the use case

The highly demanding 5G native applications such as cloud VR are both bandwidth consuming and latency sensitive. However, for such traffic-intensive and highly interactive applications, current semi-static QoS framework cannot efficiently satisfy diversified QoE requirements especially taking into account potentially significant fluctuation of radio transmission capability. It is expected that QoE estimation/prediction from application level can help deal with such uncertainty and improve the efficiency of radio resources, and eventually improve user experience.

The main objective is to ensure QoE optimization be supported within the O-RAN architecture and its open interfaces. Multi-dimensional data, e.g., user traffic data, QoE measurements, network measurement report, can be acquired and processed via ML algorithms to support traffic recognition, QoE prediction, and QoS enforcement decisions. ML models can be trained offline and model inference will be executed in a real-time manner. Focus should be on a general solution that would support any specific QoE use case (e.g., cloud VR, video, etc.).

4.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Retrieve necessary QoE related measurement metrics from network level measurement report and SMO (can acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML model that will be deployed in Near-RT RIC to assist in the QoE optimization function. For example, this could be application classification, QoE prediction, and available bandwidth prediction.

Training of potential ML models for predictive QoE optimization, which can respectively autonomously recognize traffic types, predict quality of experience, or predict available radio bandwidth.

Send policies/intents to Near-RT RIC to drive the QoE optimization at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

Near-RT RIC:

Support update of AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC.

Support execution of the AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC, e.g., application classification, QoE prediction, and available bandwidth prediction.

Support interpretation and execution of intents and policies from Non-RT RIC to derive the QoE optimization at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

Sending QoE performance report to Non-RT RIC for evaluation and optimization.

E2 nodes:

Support network state and UE performance report with required granularity to SMO over O1 interface.

Support QoS enforcement based on messages from A1/E2, which are expected to influence RRM behavior.

4.2.4	Required data

Multi-dimensional data are expected to be retrieved by Non-RT RIC for AI/ML model training and policies/intents generation.

Network level measurement report, including:

UE level radio channel information, mobility related metrics

L2 measurement report related to traffic pattern, e.g., throughput, latency, packets per-second, inter frame arrival time

RAN protocol stack status: e.g., PDCP buffer status

Cell level information: e.g., DL/UL PRB occupation rate

QoE related measurement metrics collected from SMO (can acquire data from application or network).

User traffic data, which can be obtained via a proprietary interface from existing data collection equipment and is currently out of the scope of A1 or E2.

4.2.5	A1 usage example

There are 3 examples to explain how A1 policy woks for QoE optimization.

One is for ue_id (100), slice_id (1) and qos_id (5QI =50), the target QoE score (for example video MOS 80) should be satisfied.

{

    "policy_id": "1",

    "scope": {

      "ue_id": "100",

      "slice_id": "1",

      "qos_id": "50"

    },

    "statement": {

     "qoe_score": "80"

    }

}

The second example is to regulate specific QoE targets, for example, initial buffering time for video streaming is required within 2 seconds, rebuffering frequency is 2 times and stalling ratio is 5% for a customized time window (e.g., 30 seconds).

{

    "policy_id": "2",

    "scope": {

      "ue_id": "101",

      "slice_id": "1",

      "qos_id ": "51"

    },

    "statement": {

																								      "initial_buffering": “2”,

																								      "reBuffFreq":“2”,

																								      "stallRatio": “5”

}

}

The specific user id need not be required, and only slice_id and flow_id are required for specific QoE targets.

{

    "policy_id": "3",

    "scope": {

      "slice_id": "1",

      "flow_id": "51"

    },

4.3	QoS based resource optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support RAN QoS based resource optimization. Moreover, some high-level description and requirements over Non-RT RIC and A1 interfaces are introduced.

4.3.1	Background and goal of the use case

QoS based resource optimization can be used when the network has been configured to provide some kind of preferential QoS for certain users. One such scenario can be related to when the network has been configured to support e2e slices. In this case, the network has functionality that ensures resource isolation between slices as well as functionality to monitor that slice Service Level Specifications (SLS) are fulfilled.

In RAN, it is the scheduler that ensures that Physical Resource Block (PRB) resources are isolated between slices in the best possible way and also that the PRB resources are used in an optimal way to best fulfill the SLS for different slices. The desired default RAN behavior for slices is configured over O1. For example, the ratio of physical resources (PRBs) reserved for a slice is configured at slice creation (instantiation) over O1. Also, QoS can be configured to guide the RAN scheduler how to (in real-time) allocate PRB resources to different users to best fulfill the SLS of a specific slice. In the NR NRM this is described by the resource partition attribute.

Instantiation of a RAN sub-slice will be prepared by rigorous planning to understand to what extent deployed RAN resources will be able to support RAN sub-slice SLS. Part of this procedure is to configure RAN functionality according to above. With this, a default behavior of RAN is obtained that will be able to fulfill slice SLSs for most situations. However, even through rigorous planning, there will be times and places where the RAN resources are not enough to fulfill SLS given the default configuration. To understand how often (and where) this happens, the performance of a RAN slice will continuously be monitored by SMO. When SMO detects a situation when RAN SLS cannot be fulfilled, Non-RT RIC can use A1 policies to improve the situation. To understand how to utilize A1 policies and how to resolve the situation, the Non RT-RIC will use additional information available in SMO.

Take an emergency service as an example of a slice tenant. For this example, it is understood (at slice instantiation) that 50% of the PRBs in an area can be enough to support the emergency traffic under normal circumstances. Therefore, the ratio of PRBs for the emergency users is configured to 50% as default behavior for the pre-defined group of users belonging to the emergency slice. Also, QoS is also configured in core network and RAN so that video cameras of emergency users get a minimum bitrate of 500 kbps.

Now, suppose a large fire is ongoing and emergency users are on duty. Some of the personnel capture the fire on video on site. The video streams are available to the emergency control command. Because of the high traffic demand in the area from several emergency users (belonging to the same slice), the resources available for the emergency slice is not enough to support all the traffic. In this situation, the operator has several possibilities to mitigate the situation. Depending on SLAs towards the emergency slice compared to SLAs for other slices, the operator could reconfigure the amount of PRB reserved to emergency slice at the expense of other slices. However, there is always a risk that emergency video quality is not good enough irrespective if all resources are used for emergency users. It might be that no video shows sufficient resolution due to resource limitations around the emergency site.

In this situation, the emergency control command decides, based on the video content, to focus on a selected video stream to improve the resolution. The emergency control system gives the information about which users to up- and down-prioritize to the E2E slice assurance function (through e.g., an edge API) of the mobile network to increase bandwidth for selected video stream(s). Given this additional information, the Non-RT RIC can influence how RAN resources are allocated to different users through a QoS target statement in an A1 policy. By good usage of the A1 policy, the emergency control command can ensure that dynamically defined group of UEs provides the video resolution that is needed.

The use case can be summarized as per below:

A fire draws a lot of emergency personnel to an area.

Because of this, RAN resources becomes congested which affects the video quality for all video feeds in the area.

The emergency control command have 5 active video feeds and selects one video feed which is of specific interest.

The emergency control command requests higher resolution of a selected feed, while demoting the other.

With this information, the Non-RT RIC will evaluate how to ensure higher bandwidth for the feed selected by emergency control command (and lower for other feeds).

The Non-RT RIC updates the policy for the associated UEs in the associated Near-RT RIC over the A1 interface.

Near-RT RIC enforce the modified QoS target for the associated UEs over the E2 interface to fulfil the request.

The emergency control command experiences a higher resolution of the selected video feed.

4.3.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Figure 4.3.3.1-1: Flow diagram of QoS based resource optimization use case

4.3.4	Required data

For this use case, different kind of observability need to be reported to Non-RT RIC. First Non-RT RIC shall monitor resource consumption in the area. As long as resource consumption is low, the RAN scheduler will be able to give all users in an area the needed resources. When resource consumption in an area increases above a threshold, there is risk of that the default configuration of RAN will not be enough to fulfil the requirements. At this point, the Non-RT RIC need to be able to configure more detailed reporting for individual UEs that the Non-RT RIC is interested in. This detailed observability should provide the Non RT RIC better insight in performance for specific users and therefore includes observability of e.g., user throughput and delay. With this more detailed observability, the Non-RT RIC can understand when pre-configured priorities are not enough for the scheduler to solve the problem and when additional (non-RAN) information to solve the prioritization is needed.

4.3.5	A1 usage example

Example scenario

One emergency RAN sub-slice defined (S-NSSAI=1) with a ratio of 50% configured. 5QI=74 configured for a minimum bitrate of 500 kbps.

4 UEs (UeId=10, 11, 12, 13) in the area which belongs to S-NSSAI = 1 and with active flows of 5QI = 74.

Resource shortage means that minimum bitrate 500 kbps cannot be fulfilled for all users.

E2E Slice assurance function indicates to Non-RT RIC that UeId=10 and 12 needs to be prioritized.

Because of resource shortage, increasing minimum bitrate for UeId=10 and 12 will not improve, instead minimum bitrate for other users in slice needs to be lowered.

An alternative way to temporarily change RAN behavior for S-NSSAI=1 users is to change the relative priority in the scheduler. This would change the relative resource assignment to different users with different priority.

4.4	Context-based dynamic HO management for V2X

This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements for the context-based dynamic HO management for V2X use case, allowing operators to adjust radio resource allocation policies through the O-RAN architecture, reducing latency and improving radio resource utilization.

4.4.1	Background and goal of the use case

V2X communication allows for numerous potential benefits such as increasing the overall road safety, reducing emissions, and saving time. Part of the V2X architecture is the V2X UE (SIM + device attached to vehicle) which communicates with the V2X Application Server (V2X AS). The exchanged information comprises Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) (from UE to V2X AS) [i.2], radio cell IDs, connection IDs, and basic radio measurements (RSRP, RSPQ, etc.)

As vehicles traverse along a highway, due to their high speed and the heterogeneous natural environment V2X UEs are handed over frequently, at times in a suboptimal way, which can cause handover (HO) anomalies: e.g., short stay, ping-pong, and remote cell. Such suboptimal HO sequences substantially impair the functionality of V2X applications. Since HO sequences are mainly determined by the Neighbor Relation Tables (NRTs), maintained by the xNBs, there is hardly room for UE-level customization.

This UC aims to present a method to avoid and/or resolve problematic HO scenarios by using past navigation and radio statistics in order to customize HO sequences on a UE level. To this end, the AI/ML functionality that is enabled by the Near-RT RIC is employed.

4.4.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models that will be deployed in Near-RT RIC to assist in the V2X HO management function.

Support deployment and update of AI/ML models into Near-RT RIC xApp.

Support communication of intents and policies (system-level and UE-level) from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC.

Figure 4.4.3.1-1: V2X HO management use case flow diagram

4.4.4	Required data

The measurement counters and KPIs (as defined by 3GPP) should be appropriately aggregated by cell, QoS type, slice, etc.

Measurement reports with RSRP/RSRQ/CQI information for serving and neighboring cells.

UE connection and mobility/handover statistics with indication of successful and failed handovers and error codes, etc.

V2X related data: position, velocity, direction, navigation data, CAMs.

4.4.5	Proposed solution(s)

4.4.5.1	Workflow overview

The use case workflow consists of these main components:

1.	Data collection & maintenance: This is required at Non-RT RIC (over O1 and Enrichment Interface (EI)). Required radio measurements and V2X related metrics are collected over a longer period of time (sufficient to facilitate model training). The O1/EI data collection is used for offline training of models, as well as for generating A1 policies for V2X HO optimization. The E2 (and EI) data collection is used for model execution in the Near-RT RIC. Details of the models are described below.

2.	Long-term HO analytics & model maintenance: The Non-RT RIC long-term analytics is responsible for providing the relevant models for V2X HO optimization over A1 interface. Based on O-RAN A1 interface specs v1, these policies can be defined at per-UE level, UE group level, cell or xNB level etc. This will provide the optimization scope/objective for the Near-RT RIC V2X HO xApp. The xApp hosts two AI/ML-assisted functions: 1. HO anomaly detection & prediction, 2. HO anomaly avoidance. The 1. trained model's input is [E2: HO sequences, UE radio measurements; EI: position, velocity, direction, (O) navigation data, (O) cell load data of cells in the area] of a given time window, while the output is [anomaly likelihoods for possible future HO sequences]. The 2. trained model's input is [E2 report, EI report, output of 1. model, (O) navigation data, (O) cell load data of cells in the area] and its output is [UE-customized NRT sequence for cells that the UE is about to touch, with lower anomaly likelihood, (O) with validity time]. The two models are regularly retrained/updated based on new radio/V2X data.

4.	HO anomaly prediction & detection: The navigation information and HO sequence and predicted HO sequence of V2X UEs in scope are evaluated and HO anomalies are detected or predicted. If any, it is delegated for further consideration for HO sequence optimization.

5.	HO sequence optimization: Based on the E2 and enrichment reports and the prediction/detection output, the trained AI/ML model outputs UE-customized NRTs for the cells that I. are in scope, II. the UE is about to come in touch with.

6.	V2X HO optimization execution: The new NRTs are deployed at xNBs through E2 policies.

4.4.5.2	Overview of ML models

While many combinations and deployments are possible, this proposal outlines one specific set of models and analytics that can be useful to drive such a use case.

NonRT_Model1: The Non-RT RIC ML-assisted solution uses the O1-based and EI-based data collection to monitor the V2X UE HO performance metrics and the navigation indicators (position, direction, speed, (O) traffic indicators). Based on the performance monitoring, the model aims to represent navigation and radio environments/conditions and maintain a data base in order to classify HO situations. Input: historical radio, HO, and location, direction, velocity data. Output: maintained database with locations, directions, velocities and cells, HO situations, HO anomalies, and/or sequences of all these, together with prevalence rates (=estimated probabilities).

NearRT_Model1: The first ML-assisted near-RT xApp model in the Near-RT RIC aims to rate/score future/current HO situations (on a UE level) based on real-time radio (E2) and navigation conditions (EI), i.e., predict/detect anomalous HO situations. Input: per-UE current radio parameters, HO history, location, direction, velocity. Output: predicted HO sequence(s) with probabilities for anomalies at specific cell pairs.

NearRT_Model2: The second ML-assisted near-RT xApp model in the Near-RT RIC aims to choose alternative, UE specific NRTs for a set of cells and UEs so as to resolve or avoid anomalous HO situations. Input: input and output of the NearRT_Model1. Output: alternative, UE specific NRTs for some cells (e.g., with temporal validity/expiration time).

4.4.6	A1 enrichment interface aspects

1. As per ETSI EN 302 637-2 [i.2], V2X UE provides CAMs (which include its GPS coordinates) on a 0.1-1s temporal granularity to the V2X application server. The inference part of this use case depends on accurate navigation data from V2X UEs, thus we expect this data to be provided through the A1-EI without substantial processing or delay.

2. The data (in particular the GPS coordinates) received over A1-EI need to be correlated with RAN UE data. For this problem there might be different requirements for the training data collection and the inference data collection. E.g., the UE data association might be solved using the ECGI + C-RNTI identifiers at any point in time (inference), but when collecting historical data for training it is essential to save the data in such a way that later correlation is possible as well.

4.4.7	A1 usage example

As of now the A1 aspect of the use case is confined to whether the HO optimization is, within a certain scope, activated or not. Thus, some of the attributes can overlap with the policy scope, but they are proposed in order to allow for more fine-grained control (e.g., optimize for only vehicles that are faster than 100 km/h [vel_range], between 7am and 9am on workdays [time_range], within a given geographical area [pos range] or [cell_id_list].)

The proposed (optional) attributes of the statement type v2x_nrt_opt are captured in table 4.4.7-1.

4.5	RAN slice SLA assurance

The 3GPP standards architected a sliceable 5G infrastructure which allows creation and management of customized networks to meet specific service requirements that can be demanded by future applications, services and business verticals. Such a flexible architecture needs different requirements to be specified in terms of functionality, performance and group of users which can greatly vary from one service to the other. The 5G standardization efforts have gone into defining specific slices and their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on application/service type as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. Since network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes the core network, the transport network and the Radio Access Network (RAN), these requirements should be met at any slice subnet during the life-time of a network slice as specified in 3GPP TS 28.530 [3], especially in RAN side. Exemplary slice performance requirements are specified in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, latency and reliability at a high level in SDOs such as 3GPP TS 22.261 [1] and GSMA [9]. These requirements are defined as a reference for SLA/contractual agreements for each slice, which individually need proper handling in NG-RAN.

Although network slicing support is started to be defined with 3GPP Release 15, slice assurance mechanisms in RAN needs to be further addressed to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN environment. It is necessary to assure the SLAs by dynamically controlling slice configurations based on slice specific performance information. Existing RAN performance measurements as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 [5] and information model definitions as specified in 3GPP TS 28.541 [4] are not enough to support RAN slice SLA assurance use cases. This use case is intended to clarify necessary mechanisms and parameters for RAN slice SLA assurance.

4.5.1	Background and goal of the use case

In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific business requirements. These requirements include customizable network capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G standardization efforts, the 5G system can support the needs of the business through the specification of several service needs such as data rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN’s open interfaces and AI/ML based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

4.5.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Retrieve RAN slice SLA target from respective entities such as SMO, NSSMF.

4.5.5	A1 usage example

Example scenario 1

One mobile leased line network slice for live broadcasting is defined (S-NSSAI=1).

The SLA for the slice is defined with the total UL/DL throughput of 30 Mbps of the users in the slice provided in the coverage area (cellId=1, 2, 3).

Non-RT RIC generates A1 policy for Near-RT RIC slice SLA assurance, which includes S-NSSAI and cellId as scope identifiers, and per-slice total PDCP layer throughput target as a policy statement.

Near-RT RIC enforces the policy and guides RAN behavior via E2 to meet the slice SLA.

{

    "PolicyId": "1",

    "scope": {

      "sliceId": "1",

		“cellId”: ”1”, ”2”, ”3”, // Multiple cellIds need to be supported

    },

    "statement": {

      "uLThptPerSlice": "30"

"dLThptPerSlice": "30"

    }

}

Example scenario 2

Background of the scenario

SLA violation occurs when a cell is congested, and not enough resources are allocated to slice users. To minimize this kind of SLA violation, load balancing is effective.

Although load balancing can be performed using traffic steering preference policy type, that approach is insufficient to reduce the load to desired level, because there will be a gap between the actual load and the load recognized by Non-RT RIC due to long monitoring and control interval of Non-RT RIC. As shown in figure 4.5.5-1, the near-real-time control loop can achieve smaller reaction time than the non-real-time control loop. Therefore, it is preferable to use Near-RIC for load balancing.

In this scenario, by using A1 policy for load balancing, the load balancing is performed in a shorter cycle, which is more effective in assuring slice SLAs.

Figure 4.5.5-1: Illustration of the control loops involving Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC and E2 nodes

Overall flow in the scenario

In this scenario, Non-RT RIC monitors the load and performance under the cell and decides whether the cell load should be balanced or not. Only when cell congestion is detected or predicted, A1 policy for load balancing is sent to Near-RT RIC, and Near-RT RIC performs cell load balancing to ease the cell congestion and solve SLA violation.

The following example describes the overall steps in load balancing to assure slice SLAs defined by delay requirement. Note that the step number corresponds to the number given in figure 4.5.5-2.

An A1 policy (PolicyId: 1) corresponding to SLA of slice #1, which includes delay requirement per UE for users of cell A~E, and slice #1, is sent from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC.

To monitor the cell load and performance of delay, Non-RT RIC collects mean DL PRB used for data traffic (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 [5], clause 5.1.1.2.5) from cell A~E, and distribution of delay DL air-interface (per S-NSSAI) (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 [5], clause 5.1.1.1.2) from cell A~E via O1.

In Non-RT RIC, when the load of cell A is high, and the percentage of packets of slice #1 experiencing a longer delay than required, Non-RT RIC determines that the SLA violation is due to high load and decides to start load balancing. Non-RT RIC sends an A1 policy (PolicyId: 2) to transfer the load of cell A to neighboring non-congested cells (cell B, D and E) until the load of cell A becomes smaller than 80%.

To monitor the load and radio quality, Near-RT RIC collects mean DL PRB used for data traffic (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 [5], clause 5.1.1.2.5) from cell A~E, and per-UE RSRP measurement and RSRQ measurement (as specified in E2SM-KPM [16], clauses 8.2.1.2.2, 8.2.1.2.3 and in 3GPP TS 28.552 [5], clauses 5.1.1.22, 5.1.1.31) via E2.

Near-RT RIC decides the combination of UEs to be handed over and target cells based on the information collected in (4). Near-RT RIC sends E2 CONTROL for UE-level hand over control to decrease the load of cell A below 80%.

Non-RT RIC continues to monitor the cell load and performance. When Non-RT RIC decides that the cell load becomes low enough to not cause SLA violation, it notifies deletion of the policy (PolicyId: 2) to Near-RT RIC.

Figure 4.5.5-2: Illustration of the overall flow in the load balancing scenario

{

    "PolicyId": "2",

    "scope": {

		“cellId”: ”A” // Designate a cell of which load is to be transferred to other cells

    },

																								    "lbObjectives": {

      "targetPrbUsg": 80 // Target load of Cell A
      "prbUsgType": 1 // PRB usage type used in the calculation of targetPrbUsg

    },

    "lbResources": {

      "cellIdList": "B", "D", "E", // Designate cells to which cell load is transferred

    }

}

The illustration of the cell congestion in multi-cell environment is given in figure 4.5.5-3.

Figure 4.5.5-3: Illustration of the cell congestion in multi-cell environment

4.5.6	O1 usage example

Example scenario

One mobile leased line network slice for live broadcasting is defined (S-NSSAI=1).

The SLA for the slice is defined with the average total UL/DL throughput of 30 Mbps of the users in the slice provided in the coverage area (cellId=1, 2, 3).

Note that O1 configuration is used to assure SLAs defined as long term performance values such as average throughput, which do not need frequent reconfiguration.

In order to calculate the number of required PRBs to meet throughput requirement of the slice, Non-RT RIC collects wideband CQI distribution and data volume in UL/DL via O1. The calculated value is converted to the portion of PRB allocation to the slice i.e., rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.541 [4]).

Non-RT RIC sends rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio as O1 reconfiguration requests to E2 nodes.

Non-RT RIC also collects UL/DL PRB used for data traffic and average UL/DL UE throughput in gNB. When the PRB usage becomes low, Non-RT RIC reconfigures rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio via O1 to decrease the allocated PRBs. When the PRB usage becomes high and throughput deterioration occurs, Non-RT RIC reconfigures rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio via O1 to increase the allocated PRBs.

The illustration of the RRMPolicy reconfiguration via O1 is given in figure 4.5.6-1.

4.6	NSSI resource allocation optimization

This use case provides the background, objectives, solution, and requirements for the NSSI resource optimization, an rApp implemented in Non-RT RIC, which leverages AI/ML inference on slice performance measurement data to determine the actions to automatically optimize the resource allocation for network slice instances.

4.6.1	Background and goal of the use case

Network slicing is essential to 5G, as it enables many new services across manufacturing, autonomous driving, gaming, and many more via the provision of ultra-low latency in URLLC and huge data volume in eMBB features that require different or contrasting QoS requirements exploiting a shared RAN node. The goal of this use case is to ensure the resources are allocated dynamically and efficiently among multiple network slices sharing the RAN node.

As the new 5G services have different characteristics, the network traffic tends to be sporadic, where there can be different usage pattern in terms of time, location, UE distribution, and types of applications. For example, most IoT sensor applications can run during off-peak hours or weekends. Special events, such as sport games, concerts, can cause traffic demand to shoot up at certain time and locations. Cars with autonomous driving capability tend to require more URLLC services in the morning or afternoon rush hours in major freeways in big cities, while subscribers tend to consume eMBB services to watch video streaming at night in residential areas. Therefore, NSSI resource optimization rApp trains the AI/ML model, based on the huge volume of performance data collected over days, weeks, months from O-RAN nodes. It then performs inference function on the model with input measurements to predict the traffic demand patterns of 5G networks in different times and locations for each network slice, and automatically optimize the resource allocation for network slice instances accordingly.

4.6.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Receive measurements to monitor the usage of RRM resources (e.g., PRB, RRC, DRB) identified by S-NSSAI from E2 nodes via the O1 interface.

It also shows that two network slices, identified by S-NSSAI#1 supporting URLLC, and S-NSSAI#2 supporting eMBB. The goal of this use case is to optimize the resources associated with RAN network slices.

An example of PRB resource allocation for S-NSSAI#1 and S-NSSAI#2 at the O-DU is shown in figure 4.6.5-2.

At 15:00, the dedicated resources and prioritized resources for S-NSSAI#1 were increased to 20% and 50% respectively for as more cars demand more URLLC services at the start of rush hours.

4.7	Massive MIMO optimization

Massive MIMO optimization is one of the top priority use cases in O-RAN. Several massive MIMO sub-features have been proposed and studied during the massive MIMO pre-normative study, which is documented in the O-RAN.WG1.MMIMO-USE-CASES-TR-v01.00 [i.3], including the potential data requirements for each of the sub-use cases. The following sub-clauses provide the background, objectives, solutions, deployment options, and identified WG2 requirements for massive MIMO sub-features

4.7.1	Massive MIMO Grid-of-Beams Beamforming (GoB BF) optimization

4.7.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

Massive MIMO (mMIMO) is among the key methods to increase performance and QoS in 5G networks. Capacity enhancement is obtained by means of beamforming of the transmitted signals, and by spatially multiplexing data streams. Beamforming can increase the received signal power and simultaneously decrease the interference generated for other users, hence resulting in higher SINR and higher user throughputs. Grid-of-Beams (GoB) with the corresponding beam sweeping has been introduced to allow beamforming of the control channels used during initial access as well as for data transmission and reception, mainly for high frequency (but can be used also for the sub-6 GHz band) MIMO operation. The physical properties of the antenna array and its possible configurations characterize the span of the beams, namely the horizontal and vertical aperture in which beamforming is supported, and therefore the coverage area and the shape of the cell. mMIMO can be deployed in 5G macrocell clusters as well as in heterogeneous networks, where macrocells and small cells co-exist and complement each other for better aggregated capacity and coverage. In order to obtain optimal beamforming and cell resources (Tx power, PRB) configuration, one will have to look at a multi-cell environment instead of a single cell. Moreover, different vendors can have different implementations in terms of the number of beams, the horizontal/vertical beam widths, azimuth and elevation range, to achieve the desired coverage. In a multi-node/multi-vendor scenario, centralized monitoring and control is required to offer optimal coverage, capacity and mobility performance as well as control over electromagnetic emissions in order to comply with regulatory requirements.

The problem associated with traditional mMIMO BF is that its performance is highly dependent on the choice of the Beam Forming (BF) pattern. Manual configuration is usually based on the empirical knowledge and manual test results of the domain expert(s) and is performed in a semi-static way. That is, (near-)real time contextual, per-site information (such as cell geometry change, user/traffic distribution, mobility patterns, seasonalities etc.) is taken into account in a suboptimal and non-real-time way. This can cause one or more of the following problems:

High inter-cell interference.

Unbalanced traffic between neighboring cells.

Low performance at the cell edges or throughout the cell.

Poor handover performance.

This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly configure the mMIMO BF parameters in a cell or in a cluster of cells by means of policies and configuration assisted by Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The configuration optimization relies on contextual information and patterns such as the user distribution, traffic demand distribution, cell geometries, and mobility.

4.7.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Collect the necessary configurations, performance indicators, and measurement reports from the E2 nodes (O-DU), triggered by Non-RT RIC FW if required.

4.7.1.4	Required data

The specification of the data communicated over O1 is outside the scope of WG2.
There are no data that are relevant for the A1 interface.

4.7.2	Massive MIMO Non-GoB Beamforming (Non-GoB BF) optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support Non-Grid of Beams beamforming optimization. Non-RT RIC could be used to train AI/ML models for Non-GoB BF selection xApps, which intelligently recommend best Non-GoB BF modes to a O-gNB or O-DU.

Note that non-AI/ML based solutions for Non-GoB BF optimization is not precluded. The AI/ML model training, deployment, and inference described below are not applicable to non-AI/ML based solutions.

4.7.2.1	Background and goal of the use case

Non-GoB BF approaches are an important class of beamforming algorithms for 5G massive MIMO deployments, especially for implementations in sub-6 GHz frequency bands. For example, beam weights can be computed at the O-gNB or O-DU based on channel measurements of Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) without predefined beam sets, assuming uplink and downlink correspondence.

Noted that Non-GoB BF modes are not standardized, instead they are vendor-specific proprietary algorithms. Multiple Non-GoB BF modes can be implemented, as some modes perform better than others under particular wireless conditions. Non-GoB BF modes can differ in the following aspects:

MIMO modes (i.e., SU-MIMO or MU-MIMO)

Channel estimation algorithms

Beam weight calculation approaches (e.g., Matched Filter (MF), Zero-Forcing (ZF), eigen-beamforming, etc.)

Time and frequency granularity of beamforming, etc.

To select the best Non-GoB BF modes, the SMO/Non-RT RIC and the Near-RT RIC are not required to understand the details of a specific Non-GoB BF modes, e.g., how the beamforming weights are computed under a mode. They only need to know how many Non-GoB BF modes are supported in the O-DU and the performance of each mode.

The goal of this use case is therefore to provide an intelligent control over multiple supported Non-GoB BF modes in order to recommend a preferred mode to a BS as a function of wireless conditions, such as channel quality, UE location and mobility, interference condition, PHY layer configuration, etc.

Time granularity of the enrichment information reports (e.g., integer multiple of a second)

Note that for model inference, above EI is sent from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC via the A1 interface.

4.7.2.5	A1 enrichment information example

In training phase, the retrieved enrichment information (e.g., UE mobility and location information) needs to be associated with collected per-UE L1/L2 measurement reporting (e.g., L1-RSRP and/or L1-SINR, etc.) and UE context information (e.g., UE-specific SRS periodicity) by the Non-RT RIC. In the inference phase, such data association is performed by the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, the EI delivered over the A1 interface should contain necessary UE identification to facilitate the data association at the Near-RT RIC. The Near-RT RIC shall be able to recognize the UE identification and be able to map it to the UE identification used over the E2 interface.

For example, the A1 enrichment information contains the following information elements:

UE identifier

Position of the UE

Height of the UE

Time stamp when the position and height was recorded

4.7.3	MIMO optimization via MIMO DL Tx power optimization, MU-MIMO pairing, and MIMO mode selection

This use case will provide the objective, solutions, and data requirements related to MIMO optimization based on three key sub-features involving downlink transmit power, MIMO pairing enhancement (user separability), and user MIMO mode selection (MU-MIMO or SU-MIMO) that are described in detail in the O-RAN.WG1.MMIMO-USE-CASES-TR-v01.00 [i.3]. The use-case leverages Non-RT RIC to train and host the relevant models and applications that rely on O1 interface services to intelligently optimize MIMO capacity and user experience.

4.7.3.1	Background and goal of the use case

4.7.3.1.1	MIMO downlink transmit power optimization

For general downlink precoding, the downlink transmit power is usually evenly distributed across the UEs.  However, depending on the UE separability and path loss deltas, this can result in good cell capacity at the expense of individual UE quality.  This can be due to several issues such as cell edge UEs having general downlink SINR issues (even without MU-MIMO), poor UE separability between cell edge UEs, and poor uplink SINR resulting in degraded SRS which are a few example issues. The result of these issues can be manifested by observations of very poor individual UE SINRs (either downlink, uplink, or both) when running in a MU-MIMO mode. Therefore, although the capacity of the cell has been significantly increased, certain customer experiences can become unacceptable in this MU-MIMO mode.

The solution to the problem described above is to simply provide observations of UE performance in the form of periodic histograms of UE channel quality as well as the overall cell capacity in order to compute an optimal solution via AI/ML with control of the downlink minimum required SINR threshold to achieve a minimal UE quality requirement that is set by the operator. The minimum required SINR is a threshold recommendation and thus doesn’t require real time AI/ML adjustment of transmit power directly but rather leaves this to the scheduler to adjust and optimize consistent with its numerous other priorities and requirements.

The value of this observability and adjustability allows the operator to optimize the trade-off between cell capacity and individual user/customer quality which is essential to provide the best customer experience. The trade-off, for example, can reduce a very high cell centre data rate (which would likely be unnoticeable for the user) to allow more power to be allocated to the cell edge user (who is noticing low tput and large latencies) to improve the cell edge data rate situation.

4.7.3.1.2	MU-MIMO pairing enhancement (user separability)

Existing channel orthogonality between multiple users is critical to create user separability and allow for the opportunity to share radio frequency resources simultaneously. Failing this, residual interference will be too high to maintain adequate post pairing radio link signal quality levels required to sustain MU-MIMO mode assignments. With mobility there is an added demand to adjust beamforming weight assignments to not only maintain signal power levels at the user end (beam quality), but also to continuously limit the inter user interference experienced between users assigned with the same radio resource allocations. If these challenges are left unaddressed, a 5G massive MIMO deployment will fail to utilize the full capability of large antenna arrays powered by transceivers designed to transmit data channel signals towards a spatially confined direction. Further, the network will also fail to realize potential multiplexing gains as fewer radio resource blocks are shared between users within the same cell, reducing spectral efficiency.

Another important aspect is the need to efficiently identify users with low demand for radio resources - sources of bursty traffic. An intelligent assessment of how best such users can be effectively paired, if at all, with other users, needs to be pre-determined by the RIC. In summary, this use case suggests various measurement objects that are recommended as input into the AI/ML analytics Apps to optimally determine the outputs required to optimize the MU-MIMO feature operation.

The AI/ML assisted modelling and training output, along with the Non-RT RIC based enhancement/inference, will strive to deliver end goal solution selections and system configuration options that upon adoption within the respective domains where they reside, realize an optimization framework that maximizes the potential of a MU-MIMO feature. Capacity augmentation will be realized by successfully assigning MU-MIMO layers to a greater number of users simultaneously, more often, and more uniformly across the serving area of each gNB.

4.7.3.1.3	MIMO mode selection optimization (MU-MIMO vs SU-MIMO selection)

A successful MU-MIMO operation involves the realization of as many orthogonal radio frequency channel links between multiple spatially separated users as possibly as supported by the implementation software at the digital domain. Key to such realization is the successful beamforming weight determination that enables not only the phase addition of multipath signals at the user receiver, but also the choice of precoding algorithms which limit the residual interference between the paired users. It can make sense for the scheduler to prioritize the assignment of radio resources to a MU-MIMO mode of operation during periods of congestion or when high latency requiring applications are supported (to free up other resources that can be assigned sooner). However, doing so at the expense of undesirably lower spectral efficiency on these assigned radio resources will reduce overall sector throughput levels and create poor user experience. It is important to find a means through the AI/ML agent to distinguish users and identify sectors where optimal operation means a greater assignment of SU-MIMO modes independently to users, especially those requiring higher throughput, using devices that are capable of supporting higher layer SU-MIMO count, and operating in an environment that sustains a greater channel rank.

With increased loading massive MIMO systems will incur rising levels of interference on the uplink from connected users and on the downlink from the gNB. In addition to normal SINR measurements, the diagnosis of interference from all spatial directions uniformly (white spatial noise) versus specific directions (spatially correlated noise) will be of interest and will require MIMO modes (SU-MIMO vs MU-MIMO) to be properly selected for assignment on a user basis.  Such implementation will optimize the per user and per cell throughputs, taking into consideration channel orthogonality conditions rank realizable, and per user effective bandwidth requirement.

4.7.4	AI/ML-based initial access (SS Burst Set) configuration optimization

4.7.4.1	Background and goal of the use case

3GPP NR based wireless cellular networks promises to provide leaner system design compared to its predecessors in a bid to improve spectral efficiency, power consumption performance and reduce interferences. Ultra-lean design aims to minimize “always on” reference signal transmissions in the downlink. Synchronization Signals Burst (SSB) sets are one of the high-overhead “always on” reference signals. In large scale NR networks with thousands of gNB/Transmission-Reception Points (TRPs) deployed, system configurations derived statically/manually aiming to accommodate worst case scenario which may arise only for a small window of time can impact on the followings:

Increased overhead i.e., degraded utilization of time-frequency resources affecting Spectral Efficiency (SE).

Increased interferences among the cells.

Increased power consumptions in both network and UEs leading increased network CAPEX and reduced UE battery life respectively.

In this context, this sub-use case proposes an AI/ML assisted optimization framework wherein AI/ML agent/engine running at Non-RT RIC can infer optimal SSB set configuration (i.e., number of SS blocks, SS beam directions and SS burst periodicity) based on Configuration (CM) parameters, Performance Measurements (PM), Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and measurement report traces obtained from the E2 nodes (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-eNB) and O-RU. At high-level, the goal of the optimization problem is to minimize SS signal transmissions overhead i.e., determine the minimum number of SSB beams required, their directions and periodicity subject to KPI (integrity, mobility, etc.) targets.

The overall scheme can be summarized as follows. Based on the history/trace/distribution of UE-specific beams (e.g., P2 beams), the AI/ML engine determines the minimum number of SSB beams, their directions and the maximum periodicity of the SS burst required to achieve KPI targets as per history/trace/distribution of UE-specific beams. Furthermore, in order to handle the lower probability occurrences in the statistical models e.g., UEs appearing in a completely new direction that has not been considered in the training data, the AI/ML engine (if required) updates the optimal set (e.g., adds beam directions that compliments the optimal directions, updates the SS burst periodicity etc.). Finally, the AI/ML engine shares the optimized SSB set configuration with gNB.

4.8	Network energy saving

This clause contains the set of energy saving use cases.

4.8.1	Carrier and cell switch off/on

4.8.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

Mobile networks often utilize multiple frequency layers (carriers) to cover the same service area. At low load, i.e., when the expected traffic volume is lower than a fixed threshold, ES can be achieved by switching off one or more carriers or entire cells without impairing the user experience. UEs previously served by the carrier or cell will be offloaded by the E2 node(s) to a new target carrier or cell prior to the switch off.

However, the switch off/on decisions are not a trivial task. There are conflicting targets between system performance and energy savings. Other carriers / cells will have to serve the additional traffic and traffic is changing over time. E2 node(s) and O-RU(s) support several techniques effecting energy consumption which might also be load dependent. While energy savings for the switched off carrier/cell is maximized, the overall energy consumption of the network might even increase.

Carrier and cell switch off/on control by the Non-RT or Near-RT RIC can consider overall network energy efficiency instead of local optimization. The switch off/on decision can optionally be made by an AI/ML model within the inference host, deployed at the Non-RT RIC to further improve decision making. Among others, the AI/ML models' functionality can include prediction of future traffic, user mobility, and resource usage and can also predict expected energy efficiency enhancements, resource usage, and network performance for different ES optimization states. Also, with addition of per-UE geographical location information such as trace record for immediate MDT measurement (as specified in 3GPP TS 32.423 [11], clause 4.34.1) and trace record for UE location information (as specified in 3GPP TS 32.423 [11], clause 4.34.2) as input data, the increased accuracy for UE location/trajectory prediction could be expected for more efficient solution so that it could prevent switched off cell(s) from being switched on even though meaningful number of UEs generating/receiving traffic do not exist  in that cell(s). In that sense these collections could be conditionally activated during some cells being switched off and be deactivated once all cells switched on in terms of UE energy saving. Possible differences among collected types of geographical location information such as between MDT and LMF are expected to be absorbed and exposed to rApp(s) based on R1 data type definition.

Before switching off/on carrier(s) or cell(s), there is a possibility the E2 node(s) and O-RU(s) of performing some preparation actions for off switching (e.g. check ongoing emergency calls and warning messages, to enable, disable, modify carrier aggregation and/or dual connectivity, to trigger HO traffic and UEs from cells/carriers to other cells or carriers, informing neighbour nodes via X2/Xn interface, etc.) as well as for on switching (e.g., cell probing, informing neighbour nodes via X2/Xn interface, etc.).This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly configure carrier and cell switch off/on parameters in a cell or in a cluster of cells through O1 configuration formulated by rApp towards E2 node(s) and O-RU(s)  or A1 policies  formulated by rApp towards Near-RT RIC  through SMO/Non-RT RIC framework assisted by machine learning (ML) techniques.

4.8.2	RF channel reconfiguration

4.8.2.1	Background and goal of the use case

In mobile networks m-MIMO antennas are used for beamforming techniques to enhance cell capacity and throughput. To achieve beamforming, O-RU(s) need to concentrate the power amplifiers at the radome by combining radiating elements. At low load, i.e., when the expected traffic volume or number of connected users are lower than the configured threshold, ES can be achieved by reducing the power consumption of O-RU(s) by switching off certain Tx/Rx arrays. For example, 32 out of 64 Tx/Rx arrays of an O-RU(s) can be switched off in a digital m-MIMO architecture and correspondingly the number of spatial layers and SSBs can be reduced. The procedure (involvement of respective O-RAN interfaces) of the RF channel reconfiguration depends on the management architecture model (hybrid or hierarchical) and the deployment option. The switch off/on decision can be made by an AI/ML model within the inference host deployed at the Non-RT RIC. Among others the AI/ML models can include prediction of future traffic, user mobility, and resource usage and can also predict expected energy efficiency enhancements, resource usage, and network performance for different ES optimization states.

This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly configure RF channel reconfiguration parameters in a cell or in a cluster of cells through O1 configuration formulated by rApp towards E2 node(s) and O-RU(s) through SMO/Non-RT RIC or A1 policies formulated by rApp towards Near-RT RIC through SMO/Non-RT RIC framework assisted by Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

4.8.2.4.2	Output data

rApps to deliver energy saving & energy efficiency A1 policies for RF channel reconfiguration optimization through R1 interface.

4.8.3	Advanced sleep mode

This use case describes a method to achieve intelligent energy saving by optimizing the sleep mode via Non-RT RIC-based guidance.

4.8.3.1 Background and goal of the use case

Mobile networks were often designed to provide higher data rates, better coverage, and ubiquitous connectivity. They have to be always available and well-dimensioned in order to ensure the best Quality of Service (QoS) even in peak hours and emergency or mass event scenarios. This may lead to an over-dimensioned and under-utilized network particularly when the traffic demand is low, such is the case during night hours.

The energy consumption of a network is composed of two components:

A fixed component, which is mainly due to the system architecture and includes the power consumption of control signals, backhaul infrastructure, and load-independent consumption of baseband processors.

A variable, load-dependent component, which depends on the transported traffic.

Over-provisioning of the network as well as low load periods translate into significant, and unnecessary, energy consumption, due to the fixed component. Sleep modes, which consist in shutting down the O-RU for a certain period of time, are an efficient way to handle this component.

It consists in a progressive deactivation of the O-RU’s components according to the time needed by each of them to shut down then reactivate again. According to this transition time, four levels of sleep modes have been specified in CUS [12], clause 16. Deeper sleep levels allow more energy saving but induce larger delays for the users who arrive to the network and who need to wait longer for the components to be reactivated. Hence, Non-RT RIC can provide policies in such cases where reactivation time may not be concern or proactively reactivates.

O-RU and E2 nodes (O-CU, O-DU) may implement various sleep modes. The sleep modes could be enabled by SMO/Non-RT RIC through A1 policy. When enabled, the Near-RT RIC selects among the sleep modes considering their capabilities, the actual traffic situation, and the network conditions. Different SM operate at different time scales (e.g., symbol, slot, frame).

This solution proposes a framework that allows the operator to flexibly select various sleep modes parameters through A1 policy formulated by rApp towards Near-RT RIC through SMO/Non-RT RIC framework assisted by Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

4.8.3.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

SMO/Non-RT RIC framework function:

Collect the configurations, performance indicators and measurement reports (e.g., cell load related information and traffic information, EE/EC measurement reports) from E2 node(s) and trace records (e.g., per-UE measurement metrics and location information) through O1 interface, for the purpose of decision making, optionally using training and inference of AI/ML models that assist such EE/ES functions.

(Optionally) Receive EE/ES AI/ML model for deployment via O1 or O2 interface.

4.8.4	Time domain cell DTX/DRX optimization (3GPP Rel-18)

4.8.4.1 Background and goal of the use case

In 3GPP Release 18 [21], clause 15.4.2.3, Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) and Discontinuous Reception (DRX) mechanisms were further enhanced to improve energy efficiency for the gNB. To reduce the gNB's downlink transmission and uplink reception active time, the UE can be configured with a periodic cell DTX/DRX pattern, which defines active and non-active periods. This pattern is common for UEs configured with this feature in the cell, and the cell DTX/DRX patterns can be configured and activated separately. A maximum of two cell DTX/DRX patterns can be configured per MAC entity for different serving cells. When cell DTX is activated, the UE may not monitor PDCCH in selected cases or does not monitor SPS occasions during the non-active duration of the cell DTX. Similarly, when cell DRX is activated, the UE does not transmit on CG resources or transmit an SR during the non-active duration of the cell DRX. This feature is applicable only to UEs in the RRC_CONNECTED state and does not impact the Random Access procedure, SSB transmission, paging, or system information broadcasting. Cell DTX/DRX can be activated or deactivated via RRC signaling or L1 group common signaling.

Cell DTX/DRX is characterized by:

Active duration: The duration during which the UE is expected to receive PDCCHs, SPS occasions, and transmit SR or CG. In this duration, the gNB's transmission/reception of PDCCH, SPS, SR, CG, and periodic/semi-persistent CSI reports are not impacted for energy-saving purposes.

Cycle: Specifies the periodic repetition of the active duration followed by a non-active period.

The active duration and cycle parameters are common between cell DTX and DRX when both are configured. If there is an emergency call or a public safety-related service (e.g., MPS or MCS), the network ensures that these services are not impacted, possibly by releasing or deactivating the cell DTX/DRX configuration. The network should also ensure at least partial overlap between the UE’s connected mode DRX on-duration and cell DTX/DRX active duration, ensuring that the UE’s DRX periodicity is a multiple of the cell DTX/DRX periodicity, or vice versa.

The Non-RT RIC considers several factors when generating A1 policies for energy savings through cell DTX/DRX. These factors include real-time traffic patterns, the density of Rel-18-capable UEs, and the potential for energy savings in specific cells. It also evaluates QoE/QoS requirements to ensure service quality is maintained. Based on this analysis, the Non-RT RIC generates A1 policies that include, but are not limited to, the following:

Activate DTX/DRX in cells with low traffic or a high concentration of Rel-18 UEs.

Steer Rel-18 UEs toward specific cells, enabling those cells to either operate efficiently or be shut down.

Bar non-Rel-18 UEs from cells optimized for DTX/DRX to maximize energy savings.

Balance QoE/QoS by adjusting traffic steering and DTX/DRX settings, ensuring energy efficiency without service

degradation.

These A1 policies are enforced by the Near-RT RIC, which dynamically applies DTX/DRX configurations and traffic steering decisions in near-real-time.

4.8.4.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

4.9	O-Cloud resource optimization

This clause contains the set of O-Cloud resource optimization use cases

4.9.1 	Use case: O-Cloud node draining use case

This use case describes the procedure for the SMO/Non-RT RIC to perform draining of specific O-Cloud node [O-Cloud node description based on O2-GA&P [13] recommendation by rApp through SMO, which can result in relocation of network functions or its components to another O-Cloud node, thereby restoring network function i.e., network healing.

4.9.1.1 Background and goal of the use case

When one or more NF(s) is (are) experiencing some performance degradation, and there is possibility that issue could not be fixed, or root cause could not be identified just by analyzing O1 (FCAPS) data. There can be a requirement of co-relating O1 and O2 (FCAPS) data optionally with the help of AI/ML, which can result in identification of root cause.

Examples for reasons to perform O-Cloud node draining:

There is possibility of faulty or misconfiguration of underneath O-Cloud node. By co-relating RAN OAM and O2 related data rApp will help in identifying issue in O-Cloud node which is found to be the root cause of NF's performance degradation, then O-Cloud can be drained, and relocation of the NF(s) on another O-Cloud node can be performed. This example explains a scenario where an action can be invoked when NF(s) performance degradation happens due to O-Cloud node(s), which can be resolved by draining the O-Cloud node.

NOTE: The O-Cloud node(s) is set to maintenance mode (as specified in O2-GA&P [13], clause 3.10.2) by default, when this use case is called.
