6.1.2.1.3.1	Initial conditions
1)	The test simulator as API Producer is ready and available to receive HTTP requests from the DUT.
6.1.2.1.3.2	Procedure
Step 1. The DUT as an API Consumer initiates a HTTP request to query service APIs.
Step 2. At the test simulator the contents of the received HTTP request are recorded.
Step 3. The test simulator does the following validation:
a)	The URI confirms to the format specified in R1AP [4]  clause 6.2.5.2.
b)	The HTTP request is a GET operation.
c) 	The message body is empty.
Step 4. The test simulator generated the appropriate HTTP response as specified in R1AP [4]  clause 6.2.5.2.1.1
NOTE:	Presence or validation of optional filter parameters is not used to determine validation on this test.
6.1.2.1.4		Expected result
