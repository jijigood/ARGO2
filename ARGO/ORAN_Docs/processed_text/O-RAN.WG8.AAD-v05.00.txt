Front Haul Module
The fronthaul module supports the open fronthaul interface specified by O-RAN Fronthaul Specification [20] lower level split distributed gNB architecture [20]. The detailed requirements and control and data plane protocols are described in O-RAN Fronthaul CUS-plane specification. The module is responsible for communication between the O-DU and O-RU. The fronthaul module processes incoming O-RAN Fronthaul CUS-plane packets and constructs outgoing CUS-plane packets. Figure 5-6 illustrates an example implementation of hardware accelerated packet processing related to the fronthaul interface.
Figure 5-6: Fronthaul library and interfaces
The FH library APIs are listed in the following table.
Table 5-1 Fronthaul library APIs
O-DU Timing Synchronization
In order to meet the timing accuracy in microsecond to sub-microsecond precision requirement over the air interface, O-DU clock needs to synchronize with the Grand Master Clock (GMC). The location of GMC and its connectivity to DU is out of scope of this specification. Please refer to Chapter 9 of [20] for details of S-plane (synchronization) aspects.
O-RAN fronthaul defines several timing distribution network topologies. IEEE1588 is used for O-RAN nodes timing synchronization protocol. GNSS based timing synchronization is another option for O-DU acquiring high accuracy timing. With GNSS based timing synchronization, first, the satellite timing messages are decoded by GNSS receiver, then the 1PPS output signal is generated. As described in O-RAN white box hardware reference specification, the 1PPS signal is connected with the PHC on fronthaul NIC. The O-DU is able to choose either IEEE1588 or GNSS synchronization method. Or it can use either one as primary timing synchronization source while keeping the other one as the backup. Here, a LinuxPTP based timing synchronization method is shown as an example. It may be used for O-DU to synchronize with GMC and distribute the clock to O-RU.
Figure 5-7: O-DU Timing Synchronization
In Figure 5-7, first, O-DU syncs up backhaul NIC PHC with GMC; second, the system clock syncs up with backhaul PHC using PHC2Sys; then the O-DU software (fronthaul library) gets the system clock using Linux kernel function call. The fronthaul NIC PHC syncs up with system clock through PTP4L. The O-DU becomes boundary clock and is able to distribute the clock through front haul network to O-RU.
Accelerator Abstraction Layer (AAL)
In previous sections, the focus is on running a complete L1 layer data on general purpose processor. In certain use cases, a dedicated hardware is used along with host processor to fulfil specific requirements on latency, power efficiency, etc. The hardware accelerator can be implemented on many types of devices such as GPU, FPGA, or ASIC. The accelerator hardware is implementation dependent and is out of scope of this specification. Even so, it is necessary to define a standardized interface to hardware accelerator, which will make the software stack portable with different hardware platform. Based on the data processing flow, the hardware accelerators are categorized into two models: lookaside and inline. In the lookaside model, an accelerator is invoked by the L1 host application to offload designated functions; when acceleration functions are completed, the results are sent back to the host application. With the inline acceleration model, the host processor invokes the accelerator to offload the data processing work, however the result is not sent back to the host. The following figures illustrates L1 processing flow based on these two types of hardware acceleration models.
Lookaside accelerator processing flow
Figure 5-8: Lookaside Accelerator Model
Inline accelerator processing flow
Figure 5-9: Inline Accelerator Model
Figure 5.8 shows the lookaside acceleration model. For the uplink data processing, the host receives the data from O-RAN via fronthaul interface; for the downlink processing, the host processor receives the data from L2 via L1/L2 interface. When either uplink or downlink data needs to be processed by accelerator, the host processor handovers the workload to the accelerator; after the data processing is completed, the results are turn over to the host. Figure 5-9 shows the inline accelerator model. In this case, the accelerator directly receives the uplink data from O-RU via front haul interface. When the L1 process is completed, the result is sent to the host via AAL in order to continue the L2 processing. For the downlink process, the finished L2 data is sent to the accelerator via AAL for L1 processing. When the L1 downlink is completed, the results are sent to O-RU.
AAL Lookaside Profile
Lookaside FEC Profile
In general, any combination of L1 functions can be offload to the accelerator. In real deployment, only those functions take more computing power will be offloaded to the accelerator. The accelerator design is implementation specific. To better represent accelerator’s functional capabilities, AAL profile is used to differentiate the combination of accelerator architecture and functions. AAL lookaside profile indicates the accelerator adopted the lookaside processing model. The AAL lookaside processing flows are explained in the early section. During the L1 process, the host application initiates the offload work to accelerator, meanwhile the host may perform other work in parallel, it retrieves the result once the work is complete. The AAL FEC Profile includes both uplink and downlink function of PDSCH and PUSCH. The downlink functions are CRC Generation, LDPC Encoding, Rate Matching. The uplink functions are Rate De-matching, LDPC Decoder, CRC Check. These functions can be invoked sequentially or individually.

Refer to the O-RAN OSC for FEC APIs details.
O-DU L2 Functional Blocks

MAC layer indicates the downlink data notification request for a logical channel along with the desired RLC PDU size. RLC segments (optionally) the SDUs depending upon the size requested from MAC and sends the RLC PDUs to MAC. MAC layer also indicates uplink data by sending RLC PDUs. RLC layer forms SDUs by reassembling the received PDUs and transmits SDUs to upper Layer via F1 interface. It does tasks defined in 3GPP TS 38.322 [8].

Figure 6-2 L2 MAC scheduler components
NR Scheduler functional block has been further expanded into indicative smaller functional sub-blocks to capture the scheduler functionality.
Note: An actual implementation may divide the scheduler into functional sub-blocks differently.
DL/UL Resource Scheduler: This corresponds to functionality of time-domain and frequency domain scheduling in DL and UL, respectively. Resource scheduling is performed per scheduling period and may be performed for a single slot or multiple slots. It may include functions such as beam selection, selecting of UEs and associated bearers per scheduling period, allocation of radio resources for PDCCH, PUSCH, PDSCH and associated channels like DMRS. The beam selection is based on various beamforming method supported in the gNB system. In the case of predefined beamforming method, an index called “beamId” indicates the specific beam pre-defined in the O-RU to use in case of hybrid architecture. However, in case of Hierarchical architecture, the beam indices are pre-defined in the O-DU as defined by O-RAN Fronthaul M-Plane specification [21]. The beam selection function selects beam indices “beamId” that is applied to DL or UL data. In the case of dynamic beamforming, the beamforming weights are given to be applied as defined in the O-RAN Fronthaul CUS Plane specification [20]. It may also include functions/algorithm to support slice differentiation as specified by RRMpolicy for the resource type (PRB) so as to meet the specific SLA. It may also include the slice metric so as to prioritize the specific slice scheduling in a particular TTI that enables the gNB DU system to meet the slice level agreement.
DL/UL Link Adaptation (LA): This functionality performs per UE Link Adaptation in DL and UL, respectively. Link Adaptation may be performed based on channel quality reported by UE or estimated at gNB corrected by BLER. LA would return effective MCS to be used for channel allocation to the UE.
UL Tx Power Control: Performs Closed loop UL power control for PUSCH, SRS and PUCCH. It may estimate the UL Tx power based on UE feedback (eg: Power Headroom Report) or measured UL channels.
DL/UL MIMO Mode Control: Determines per UE the MIMO mode, in DL and UL, respectively, to be used along with the corresponding precoding matrix.
TA Manager: Estimating the TA Command for UE based on feedback from L1 using PUSCH, PUCCH and SRS.
Performance metrics (Capacity, throughput etc.) will be dependent on software implementation and underlying hardware.

E2 service models are supported as per call flows as per specifications from O-RAN WG5. Each service model enables a use case across O-RAN nodes. The following generic design in O-DU and O-CU supports any service model with report/insert/control/policy services with the neat real-time RIC.
Figure 6-3 E2 service model support in O-DU
When an E2 message is received at O-DU, the E2 handler module interacts with SM (Service Model) Fanout module to deliver the messages to internal module related to the service model. The SM fanout module consults the SM catalog module and finds the SM specific modules and APIs to be invoked the SM-Service-API-Table module contains maps the following:
SM service, E2 messages corresponding
Receiver module(s) for each E2 message and the message contents to be relayed
When the O-DU sends an E2 message, it is sent through the E2 Sender module which consults SM Catalog module and maps the respective E2 message API. The E2 sender uses KPIs in KPI module when KPIs are reported in an E2 message.

MAC – Scheduler Interface
5G NR MAC and scheduler modules interact via well-defined APIs. The APIs ensure any scheduler implementation interworks with MAC. This ensures the freedom of choice for OEMs and operators to plug in a scheduler implementation of choice from a third-party vendor in O-DU.
The functionalities of  the scheduler module are restricted to optimal allocation of radio resources at every TTI while catering to the need of gNB for transmission of:
UE specific UL/DL data and signalling messages and
broadcast messages
To achieve the above objective, the APIs defined below abstract the scheduler of any protocol specific operations like handling payloads. The interfaces shown below and the APIs may evolve/change further in future releases of this document to achieve a more optimized scheduler implementation.
Figure 9-13 MAC-Scheduler interface
The MAC-Scheduler interface includes the slice related information (sNSSAI) associated with the logical channel, that helps the scheduler in multiplexing of MAC SDUs from one or different logical channel onto transport blocks (TB) to be delivered to the physical layer on transport channels. The slice id/sNSSAI associated with the logical channel and its slice priority (defined by the operator) derives a slice metric in the PF scheduler to do logical channel prioritization and radio resource selection so as to meet the slice SLA.

DL RLC Buffer Status Information
This API is used by RLC for reporting data volume per UE for multiple LCs. This can be used in two different ways depending on the QoS/latency requirements.
Data Volume reports are aggregated per UE (at an aggregation point such as slot indication)
This adds latency however it reduces message exchange traffic between SCHED and MAC
Data Volume is reported per LC as soon as it is received at MAC
This adds to the message exchange traffic however it would be perfect for Low Latency Usecases
Implementor of this API can choose either one of the above approaches.

O1 Interface
The O1 interface is terminated by the O-DU-OAM-Agent at O-DU to handle all configurations of L1 and L2 layers. This includes cell configuration and slice specific configuration towards MAC/SCH and RLC layer. Apart from configuration management, O1 interface does the performance management. O-DU-OAM -Agent collects the performance counters at cell level and slice level and reports it to performance management entity present in the network. The O1 interface for O-DU as in the reference [26] details the data model related to cell level and slice level configurations and the key performance metrics with the counters at cell level and sub-counters at S-NSSAI level.

Annex ZZZ : O-RAN Adopter License Agreement
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O-RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O-RAN Alliance and the entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”).
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification.
Section 1: DEFINITIONS
1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity.
1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether implemented in hardware, software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification.
1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications.
1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O-RAN Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates.
1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable by a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment of consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O-RAN Alliance or the date the patent claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent claims shall be considered Necessary Claims.
1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates.
Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE
2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in furtherance of implementations of an ORAN Specification.
2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written agreement with O-RAN Alliance.
Section 3: FRAND LICENSE
3.1 Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non- Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal grant to Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors, as set forth in Section 3.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Adopter’s distributors and the use by the Adopter’s customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations.
3.2 Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees.
3.3 Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates under Fair Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license will not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates that is not making a reciprocal grant to Adopter, as set forth in Section 3.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ distributors and the use by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations.
Section 4: TERM AND TERMINATION
4.1 This Agreement shall remain in force, unless early terminated according to this Section 4.
4.2 O-RAN Alliance on behalf of its Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors may terminate this Agreement if Adopter materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure or is not capable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days after being given notice specifying the breach.
4.3 Sections 1, 3, 5 - 11 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Under surviving Section 3, after termination of this Agreement, Adopter will continue to grant licenses (a) to entities who become Adopters after the date of termination; and (b) for future versions of ORAN Specifications that are backwards compatible with the version that was current as of the date of termination.
Section 5: CONFIDENTIALITY
Adopter will use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication, and dissemination of O-RAN Specifications to third parties, as Adopter employs with its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care. Any disclosure by Adopter to its Affiliates, contractors and consultants should be subject to an obligation of confidentiality at least as restrictive as those contained in this Section.
