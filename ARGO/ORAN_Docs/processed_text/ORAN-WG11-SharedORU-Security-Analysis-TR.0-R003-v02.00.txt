Introduction
Scope
This technical report provides the threat model and risk assessment for the Shared O-RU.  The report identifies threats and risks and recommends potential security controls to protect against those threats through safeguards or mitigation.
The steps of the threat modelling process are as follows:
Identify assets: Identify the assets of the Shared O-RU that must be protected.
Identify threats: Identify the threats that could adversely impact the Shared O-RU and threats that can use the Shared O-RU to adversely impact other components of the O-RAN system.
Identify the attack surface and attack vectors: Identify the points in the Shared O-RU where an attacker could
gain entry to a Host O-RU or Guest O-RU
gain entry to another O-RAN system through the Shared O-RU
exploit a vulnerability or misconfiguration at the Shared O-RU
compromise the Shared O-RU to degrade performance or impact availability
expose data at rest at the Shared O-RU
expose data in motion between the Shared O-RU and other O-RAN network functions
Measure risk: The extent to which confidentiality, integrity, or availability is threatened, based upon a risk-based analysis considering the impact level resulting from an attack and the likelihood of occurrence.
Recommend controls: The management, operational, and technical controls for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Shared O-RU and its information.
The sections in this Shared O-RU Security Analysis Technical Report (TR) follow the process described above.  The sections will be completed in three phases, as follow:
TR Phase 1 will identify the assets (section 2) and threats (section 3).
TR Phase 2 will complete the threat analysis (section 4), security controls (section 5), and risk analysis (section 6).  The threat analysis will be performed using the STRIDE model with a threat table completed for each threat.
TR Phase 3 will identify primary security issues (section 7) and provide recommendations for security requirements (section 8) to relevant O-RAN working groups, including WG1, WG4, and WG11.
Considerations
This Technical Report makes the following considerations:
The attack surface of the Shared O-RU includes assets that are interfaces, functions, and data.
Data-at-rest, Data-in-motion, and Data-in-use must be considered.
O-RAN Alliance WG4 is in the process of defining optional architectures for Shared O-RU.  This will influence the set assets to be protected.
The O-RAN Alliance is pursuing a zero-trust architecture (ZTA) for its specifications based upon NIST SP 800-207 [8].  This will affect the risk scoring as external and internal threats are considered.
Security controls will be recommended for specifications of the Shared O-RU.  The recommended controls provided in this report will be shared with the responsible O-RAN Alliance working group, such as WG1 and WG4, so that the appropriate specification relevant to the recommendation can be updated.
Some of the identified Shared O-RU assets may already be in scope for separate ongoing WG11 security work items.  The Shared O-RU Security Analysis Technical Report work item may inform those work items.

Terms
This document uses the verbal forms for the expression of provisions as defined in O-RAN.TSC.Drafting-Rules.0-v01.00.
This document uses the term Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as defined by US NIST in [8] and applied to 5G cloud deployments by US CISA in [9].  A ZTA provides protection from external and internal threats, assuming the following:
there is no implicit trust granted to an asset based upon ownership, physical location, or network location [8].
the adversary is already inside the network. Perimeter defenses are no longer sufficient to secure a network, and there should always be an assumption that a threat actor has established a foothold in the network [9].
This document uses the term “attack surface” defined by US NIST as
The set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from, that system, system element, or environment. [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/attack_surface]
This document refers to “sensitive information” defined by US NIST as
information whose loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or modification could adversely affect security. [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/sensitive]
Shared O-RU Assets
Architecture
The potential benefits of Shared O-RU are RAN Sharing, Neutral Host, high RAN reliability (redundancy) and RAN processing pooling.  Shared O-RU involves cooperation with the SMO, O-DU, and O-RU network.  Securing the Shared O-RU is imperative to protect the O-RAN deployment and each of its tenants.  Five optional configurations are being considered for Shared O-RU [3] and while there are common security risks, each configuration may also introduce unique security risks.  The Attack Surface of the Shared O-RU includes Functions, Interfaces, and Information, which each have assets that should be protected. The assets that should be protected listed in the following sections.
Functions
The following functions should be considered in the Shared O-RU risk analysis:
Shared O-RU
O-DU Host
O-DU Tenant
O-CU Host
O-CU Tenant
SMO Host
SMO Tenant
Neutral Host Controller (NHC)
NOTE:  NHC is not an agreed upon function in the O-RAN architecture
Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 below show these assets in Shared O-RU architecture.
Figure 2.2-1 Security Architecture for Shared O-RU Options 1 and 2
Figure 2.2-2 Security Architecture for Shared O-RU Options 3 and 4
Figure 2.2-3 Security Architecture for Shared O-RU Options 5
NOTE: NHC is not an agreed upon function in the O-RAN architecture
Interfaces
The following interfaces, as shown in Figures 2.2-1, 2.2-2, and 2.2-3, are considered in this phase of the Shared O-RU security analysis:
O1
OFH M-Plane: OAM Config and Carrier Config
New interfaces for Shared O-RU currently in specifications development will be considered in a later phase of the security analysis.  This includes Fast Dynamic Scheduling between Host and Tenant O-DUs and Slow Dynamic Scheduling between Host and Tenant SMOs.

Threats
Threat Model
The STRIDE model is used to classify threats:
S - Spoofing identity. An application or program can masquerade as another to gain advantages not typically allowed for that program.
T - Tampering with data. This involves the malicious modification of data, including making unauthorized changes to a database and alteration of data as it flows between computers.
R - Repudiation. A user or program refuses the authenticity of a good or reasonable command or action.
I - Information disclosure. This involves the exposure of information to individuals with unauthorized access to it. For example, users gain the ability to read a file that they normally would not have been granted access to, or an intruder can read data in transit between computers.
D - Denial of service. These attacks deny service to valid users, such as making a website unavailable or unusable by flooding it with illegitimate requests to keep legitimate users without access.
E - Elevation of privileges. An unauthorized user gains privileged rights to access previously no granted to compromise or destroy the system, such as a change in membership.
Threat Template
Template to present the threat characteristics:
Potential Threats and Exploits
A threat analysis is facilitated by an understanding of potential threats, as identified by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).

9. Misconfiguration and Exploitation of Serverless and Container Workloads
10. Organized Crime, Hackers & APT
11. Cloud Storage Data Exfiltration
Shared O-RU Threats
The security risks associated with the Shared O-RU are due to:
1. resource sharing in a multi-tenant environment
2. interworking between host and tenant network functions
3. interfaces between Shared O-RU and other O-RAN functions
The Shared O-RU threat analysis considers the threats listed in section 3.3 that are relevant to O-RAN and Shared O-RU.  The following threats to Shared O-RU have been identified and will be analyzed in section 4 – Threat Analysis.
Threats due to Multi-Tenancy
O-DU Host access to O-DU Tenant through Shared O-RU
O-DU Tenant access to O-DU Host through Shared O-RU
SMO Host access to SMO Tenant
SMO Tenant access to SMO Host
Threats at Shared O-RU functions
Parameter conflicts at Shared O-RU
Privilege levels for authorization to data and processes in O-RU, O-DU, and SMO
Escalation of privilege at NHC
Threats to Shared O-RU interfaces
Untrusted peering between Shared O-RU and O-DU
Insecure APIs
Message flooding
Unprotected data in transit
Threat Analysis
Threat Analysis tables are provided for each of the identified Shared O-RU threats in the subsections below. The Shared O-RU Threats are classified into 5 threat groups:
Lateral Movement Between Network Functions
User Access Threats
Data Access Threats
Availability Threats
Configuration Threats
Neutral Host Controller Threats
Table 4-1 summarizes the identifies threats for each of the Shared O-RU threat groups.  The threat analysis considers a zero trust architecture (ZTA) for which (i) micro-perimeters are established for each asset and (ii) there is no implicit trust granted to assets or users [8].  Shared O-RU assets, as discussed in the Functions, Interfaces, and Information asset groups in Section 2 Assets, are considered for the threat analysis. The threats analysis was performed on the five architectural options being considered for deployment of Shared O-RU [3], which allow use of M-Plane Hybrid or Hierarchical mode and optional use of a Neutral Host Controller (NHC).
Table 4-1 summarizes the identified threats for each of the Shared O-RU threat groups.  This may not be an exhaustive list and may be expanded in future versions of this Technical Report.
Use of the term “MNO Tenant” or “Tenant” refers to a “Shared Resource Operator (SRO)”.

Risk Assessment
This section provides risk assessment tables for each of the identified assets.  These tables list the assets, threats, impacts, and possible security controls.
A malicious actor may be a nation-state adversary, cybercriminal, or employee.  In a ZTA, perimeter defenses alone are insufficient.  O-RAN deployments, including Shared O-RU, must be protected from untrusted external sources attempting to have access, while also assuming internal threat actors are inside the network with access to its functions and data.  Security controls for a ZTA, protecting against external and internal threats, should be implemented through a risk-based approach.  A risk analysis calculates risk levels by assessing the threat’s Likelihood of attack and the Impact from the attack.  External and internal threats are from the perspective of the O-RAN architecture.  External Threats are external to the O-RAN and Internal Threats are internal to O-RAN.
Impact scores can be lowered with consideration of existing security controls.  Impact scoring is based upon current security controls.  Impact scoring does not consider security controls that may be potentially specified in the future.
Likelihood scores may be higher when the goal is a ZTA, because external and internal threats must be considered.  When likelihood scoring during a risk analysis, it is necessary to consider internal threats performing reconnaissance attacks impacting confidentiality and privacy and attacks causing damage or degrading performance impacting availability.  Internal threat actors are less likely to perform damaging attacks that are quickly and easily detected and blocked, but more likely to attempt reconnaissance attacks to collect information.  As a result, reconnaissance type attacks can be scored Likelihood = High while damaging/availability attacks can be scored Likelihood = Medium or Low.
A risk analysis of the Shared O-RU threats is provided in the tables below.  A security best practice is to periodically repeat the risk analysis to consider evolving threats and security controls, which may produce an adjusted risk score based upon Impact and Likelihood.
