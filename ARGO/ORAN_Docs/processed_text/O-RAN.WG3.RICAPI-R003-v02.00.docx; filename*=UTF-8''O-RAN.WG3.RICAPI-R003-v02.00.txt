For the purposes of the present document, the following terms apply:

Near-RT RIC: as defined in [2].

Near-RT RIC APIs: interfaces that connect xApp and Near-RT RIC platform.

Near-RT RIC Platform: a software platform to host xApps. The Near-RT RIC is comprised of the Near-RT RIC Platform and xApps.

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:

API	Application Programming Interface

Near-RT RIC	Near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller

PTI	Procedure Transaction Identity

4	General

4.1	Introduction

Clause 4 specifies the principles and conventions commonly applied to Near-RT RIC API design with the Network API approach as described in clause 7.1.2 of [2].

4.2	General Principles

For each Near-RT RIC API, the following principles should be followed:

-	A default solution that includes network protocol and message encoding should be defined to ensure interoperability. The default solution requires mandatory support by all Near-RT RIC platforms and xApps. The optional protocols available for a given APIs are discoverable by xApps.

-	The IEs in the Near-RT RIC API which refer to different specifications shall be encoded as defined in the referred specification.

The common data types applicable to several API categories should be collected in clause 10.

In addition, the following design principles shall apply:

Parallel transactions, i.e., multiple ongoing Near-RT RIC API procedures of the same types related to the same xApp, and platform functionality are supported.

4.3	Version Control

An API version shall consist of at least 3 fields, following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern according to the Semantic Versioning Specification [i.1] unless specified otherwise.

EXAMPLE:	"1.0.0".

The basic rules as reproduced from [i.1] shall apply for incrementing the versions:

-	MAJOR version is incremented if backward incompatible change is made.

-	MINOR version is incremented if functional change is made in a backward compatible way.

-	PATCH version is incremented if correction is made in a backward compatible way.

5	A1-related API

5.1	Overview

5.1.1	Protocol Stack

In this version of specification, the default protocol stack for the A1 related APIs is shown on Figure 5.1.1-1.

Note: the network layer for security protection is FFS.

Figure 5.1.1-1: Protocol stack for A1 related APIs

The A1 related APIs use gRPC [5] with Protocol Buffers [4] as the application layer serialization protocol.

5.1.2	List of A1 related APIs, procedures and messages

The A1 related API procedures introduced in clause 9.2 of [2] are categorized under the A1 related APIs. These APIs include:

A1 Policy API:  enabling A1 policy related operations for the xApps.

A1 Enrichment Information (A1-EI) API: enabling A1-EI related operations for the xApps.

These APIs are summarized in Table 5.1.2-1.

Figure 5.2.1.21 : A1 Policy Setup procedure, successful operation

The Near-RT RIC Platform initiates the procedure by sending A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message to xApp.

The A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information required by the xApp to setup one A1 policy including A1 Policy Type ID IE, A1 Policy ID IE, and A1 Policy Object IE.

Upon reception of the A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message, the xApp shall transform the received A1 policy into appropriate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements, and shall trigger Near-RT RIC Platform to accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements.

If Near-RT RIC Platform is able to accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements, xApp replies A1 POLICY SETUP RESULT message with A1 Policy Setup Result IE set to success to Near-RT RIC Platform. And xApp should store the received A1 Policy Type ID IE, A1 Policy ID IE, A1 Policy Object IE as basic elements of A1 policy profile, and label the status of corresponding A1 policy as “enforced”.

Figure 6.2.1.1.2-1: E2 Subscription procedure, successful operation

The xApp initiates the procedure by sending an E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains a unique Procedure Transaction ID IE assigned by the initiating xApp, the Global E2 Node ID IE, the RAN Function ID IE, and the E2 Subscription Details IE including one or more requested E2 actions and optionally the E2 Subscription Timer IE. The message may include the E2 Indication Destination IE which specifies the xApp's endpoint to receive E2 indications (see clause 6.2.2.1), and the E2 Subscription Delete Notification Destination IE which specifies the xApp's endpoint to receive query/notification from the Near-RT RIC platform for E2 subscription deletion (see clause 6.2.1.3/6.2.1.4).

Note: When execution order of multiple actions is not concerned, it is recommended that an E2 Subscription procedure contains a single action, to allow efficient reuse of E2 subscriptions.

At reception of the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC platform shall:

-	Search existing E2 subscription(s) for matched Global E2 Node ID IE, RAN Function ID IE and matched contents in E2 Subscription Details IE. If a matched E2 subscription exists, add the initiating xApp as a new subscriber of the E2 subscription.

-	Initiate appropriate E2AP procedure(s) to establish RIC subscription with the target E2 Node, if existing E2 subscriptions are insufficient to fulfill the request.

The Near-RT-RIC platform may use the value in the E2 Subscription Timer IE, if present, as a one-time value of the E2AP timer TRICEVENTcreate in clause 9.5 of [3], which is valid only for this transaction.

If the subscription request is successfully fulfilled, the Near-RT RIC platform shall send an E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message back to the xApp. Similar to [3], a successfully fulfilled request shall be sent if the E2 event trigger and at least one requested E2 action are admitted.

In the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message, Near-RT RIC platform shall include the associated Procedure Transaction ID IE, Global E2 Node ID IE, RAN Function ID IE and an E2 Request ID IE assigned by the Near-RT RIC platform. The message shall also indicate the admitted E2 action(s) in the Actions Admitted List IE, each with the associated E2 Action ID IE assigned by the Near-RT RIC platform.  The same E2 Request ID IE and E2 Action ID IE shall be present in any subsequent E2 INDICATION message(s). The message shall indicate, if exist, the E2 action(s) not admitted in the Actions Not Admitted List IE with appropriate cause(s).

Figure 6.2.1.2.2-1: E2 Subscription Delete procedure (xApp initiated), successful operation

The xApp initiates the procedure by sending the E2 SUBSCRIPTION DELETE (Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains the Global E2 Node ID IE and the E2 Request ID IE to indicate the target E2 subscription and optionally the E2 Subscription Delete Timer IE.

At reception of the E2 SUBSCRIPTION DELETE (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC platform shall, if the delete request is accepted by the Near-RT-RIC platform:

-	Check for other subscriber(s) of the target E2 subscription. If such subscriber(s) exists, the E2 subscription shall be maintained by the Near-RT RIC platform but no longer serve the initiating xApp; if not, the E2 subscription shall be deleted.

-	Initiate appropriate E2AP procedure(s) with the target E2 Node, if necessary, to map the change in the target E2 subscription to its corresponding RIC subscription.

The Near-RT-RIC platform may use the value in the E2 Subscription Delete Timer IE, if present, as a one-time value of the E2AP timer TRICEVENTdelete in clause 9.5 of [3], which is valid only for this transaction.

Upon success of the above processing for the target E2 subscription, the Near-RT RIC platform shall stop delivering its associated E2 INDICATION message(s) to the initiating xApp and respond the xApp with an E2 SUBSCRIPTION DELETE(Success) message. The E2 SUBSCRIPTION DELETE (Success) message shall include the same Global E2 Node ID IE and E2 Request ID IE from the request message.

Figure 6.2.2.1.2-1: E2 Indication procedure, successful operation

The Near-RT-RIC platform initiates the procedure by sending the E2 INDICATION (Push) message containing the Global E2 Node ID IE, the E2 Request ID IE, the E2 Action ID IE to the xApp. The message shall also contain the E2 Indication Type IE, the E2 Indication Header IE and the E2 Indication Message IE to carry the information from corresponding fields, i.e. the RIC Indication Type IE, the RIC Indication Header IE, and the RIC Indication Message IE, respectively, in the E2AP RIC INDICATION message. The E2 Indication SN IE and the E2 Call Process ID IE shall also be included, if corresponding fields, i.e. the RIC Indication SN IE, and the RIC Call Process ID IE, respectively, are present in the E2AP RIC INDICATION message.

At reception of the E2 INDICATION (Push) message an xApp shall:

- 	Use the Global E2 Node ID IE, the E2 Request ID IE and the E2 Action ID IE to associate the received message to the right E2 subscription. The E2 Request ID IE and the E2 Action ID IE have been assigned in the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message for each E2 subscription.

- 	Process the information carried in the E2 Indication SN IE, the E2 Indication Type IE, the E2 Indication Header IE, the E2 Indication Message IE and the E2 Call Process ID IE.

If the received E2 INDICATION (Push) message cannot be handled successfully as specified in 6.2.2.1.2, the xApp may, according to operator’s OM configuration, send E2 INDICATION (Failure) message back to the Near-RT RIC platform. The message shall include the associated Global E2 Node ID IE, E2 Request ID IE, RAN Function ID IE, E2 Action ID IE, and appropriate Cause IE.

Figure 6.2.3.1.2-1: E2 Contol procedure, successful operation

The xApp initiates the procedure by sending the E2 CONTROL (Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform, containing the Global E2 Node ID IE, the RAN Function ID IE, optionally the E2 Call Process ID IE, E2 Control Header IE, E2 Control Message IE, optionally the E2 Control Ack Request IE and optionally the E2 Control Timer IE.

At reception of the E2 CONTROL (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC platform shall:

-	Evaluate whether to reject the request due to potential control conflict, when such evaluation is required by conflict mitigation related configuration.

-	Initiate appropriate E2AP RIC Control procedure with the target E2 Node, if the request is not rejected by the Near-RT-RIC platform.

The Near-RT-RIC platform may use the value in the E2 Control Timer IE, if present, as a one-time value of the E2AP timer TRICcontrol in Clause 9.5 of [3], which is valid only for this transaction.

If the control request is successfully performed, and if the optional E2 Control Ack Request IE in the request is absent or set to “Ack”, an E2 CONTROL (Success) message shall be responded to the initiating xApp. The E2 CONTROL (Success) message shall include the Global E2 Node ID IE, the RAN Function ID IE, optionally the E2 Call Process ID IE, and optionally the E2 Control Outcome IE. The xApp may use the information contained in the optional E2 Control Outcome IE to determine subsequent actions.

If the control request is successfully performed, and if the optional E2 Control Ack Request IE in the request is set to “NoAck”, an E2 CONTROL (Success) message is not needed and xApp may consider it success.

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: xApp Registration procedure, successful operation

The xApp initiates the procedure by sending an xApp Registration (Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains a unique Procedure Transaction ID IE assigned by the initiating xApp, the optional xApp Description IE, and the Required APIs and Data Types IE that specifies the APIs and data types needed for normal operation of the xApp.

At reception of the xApp Registration (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC platform shall:

-	 Check xApp’s compatibility with the Near-RT RIC platform, using information in the Required APIs and Data Types IE.

-	Assign an xApp ID and create the profile for the xApp.

If the registration request is successfully fulfilled, the Near-RT RIC platform shall send an xApp Registration (Success) message back to the xApp.

In the xApp Registration (Success) message, the Near-RT RIC platform shall include the associated Procedure Transaction ID IE and the xApp ID IE.
