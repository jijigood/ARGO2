Security Controls
API Security – Authentication
REST APIs and gRPC APIs are being considered as valid network solutions for Near-RT RIC APIs. REST APIs use HTTP and support Transport Layer Security (TLS). REST APIs utilizes JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as encoding protocol. gRPC APIs use HTTP/2 and support as well TLS. In contrast with REST APIs, gRPC use Protobuf as encoding protocol.
Time critical E2 related APIs are currently specified to run over SCTP/Protobuf network protocol stack. The security network layer specified for E2 interface is IPsec (see SEC-CTL-E2).
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-1: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC) shall support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication via X.509v3 certificates. Client authentication, as specified in rfc 5246 (TLS 1.2) and rfc8446 (TLS 1.3), shall be used. Both the client (e.g., xApp as API consumer) and the server (e.g., Near-RT RIC platform as API producer) require a certificate, and both sides authenticate each other using their public/private key pair.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-2: Time critical APIs (e.g., E2 related APIs), not supported by TLS protocol, shall support IPsec with IKEv2 certificated-based authentication according to O-RAN security protocol specification [3].
API Security – Authorization
Authorization is the function of specifying and enforcing access rights or privileges to certain resources or services. In the actual context of Near-RT RIC, the platform as API producer shall be responsible to specify those rights/privileges for the platform services as resources to the xApps as consumers. As a guideline, an xApp should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more.
Authorization mechanisms shall be enforced by the Near-RT RIC platform in the following key API procedures [33]:
Discovery of Near-RT RIC APIs: The Near-RT RIC platform shall provide means to restrict xApps from discovery of some published APIs based on configuration policies.
E2 Subscription API procedure: The subscription management shall be based on operator’s policies. An xApp may be restricted to interface with only a subset of E2 Nodes by such policies. This procedure establishes a set of preconditions that assume authorization proccesses:
xApp has been authorized to issue E2 Subscription API requests
xApp has been authorized to request guidance from Conflict mitigation
xApp Subscription Management has been configured to permit E2 Subscription API requests only from specific list of xApps.
E2 Control API procedure: Only authorized xApps may initiate RIC control request messages issued by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Nodes, for a specific scope (e.g, E2 Node list, RAN function, etc.).
E2 Guidance API procedure: The purpose of this procedure only authorized xApp to obtain guidance from the conflict mitigation platform function prior to initiating an action.
SDL API procedures: The precondition to consume the services exposed by SDL API (e.g, client registration, fetch data, notification, store, etc.) is that xApps have been successfully registered and authorized.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-3: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC)  in Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 authorization framework as specified in in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.
The roles defined in OAuth 2.0 are assigned as follows:
Resource owner / Resource server (producer): Near-RT RIC platform modules providing services via APIs
Client (consumer): xApp
Grants shall be of the type Client Credentials Grant, as described in clause 4.4. of RFC 6749. Client authentication as specified in rfc 5246 (TLS 1.2) and rfc8446 (TLS1.3) shall be used.
SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-4: For A1-P, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7, for service requests received from a Non-RT RIC.
SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-5: For A1-EI, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 client, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.
API Security – Confidentiality and Integrity
SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-6: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC) shall support TLS to provide message confidentiality and integrity.
SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-7: Time critical APIs (e.g., E2 related APIs), not supported by TLS protocol, shall support IPsec to provide message confidentiality and integrity.
The Table 1 provides a summary of the security controls (SEC-CTL- NEAR-RT-1 to -7) and a mapping of those to the related interface/API transport protocols considered in Near-RT RIC platform..

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-8: The App/VNF/CNF package shall be cryptographically bound to one Telco Operator before its on-boarding to the O-Cloud images repository. This will prevent unauthorized package to be instantiated even if it has valid App/VNF/CNF certificate [41], [44], [45].
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-9: App/VNF/CNF packages shall be successfully authenticated and verified during instantiation to the O-Cloud Platform from the trust O-Cloud images repository using signatures from both App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-10: Signatures reaching the end of their lifetime shall be renewed before the certificate times out (signatures provided by the App/VNF/CNF Provider might be ignored if the signature of the Service Provider is valid). App/VNF/CNF packages during instantiation that do not include valid certificates shall be removed from the O-Cloud images repository and from any type of O-Cloud Platform memory.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-11: App/VNF/CNF packages stored within the O-Cloud images repository shall be protected in terms of integrity and confidentiality.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-12: App/VNF/CNF packages stored within the O-Cloud images repository shall be accessible to only authorized actors (e.g., authorized users and authorized systems) and over networks that enforce authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-13: O-Cloud images repository shall be clear of vulnerable App/VNF/CNF packages and of packages with expired or missing certificates.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-14: Sensitive information (e.g L1 Apps/VNFs/CNFs, keys, PII, passwords or other critical configuration data) that is needed during the lifecycle of the App/VNFs/CNFs shall be protected in terms of confidentiality at rest and in transit [46], [47], [48].
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-15: NFO shall contain a pre-installed root certificate of trusted CA (trusted by the Telco Operator) before the on-boarding of the App/VNF/CNF package for verifying its authenticity and integrity. Root certificate shall be delivered via a trusted channel separately from an App/VNF/CNF package [42].
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-16: App/VNF/CNF Packages shall contain a Change Log. Change log captures the changes from one version to another including but not limited to features added/removed, issues fixed as well as known issues not resolved [43].

Security Controls
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-1: App/VNF/CNF package shall be signed and verified for integrity and authenticity protection.
To provide the authenticity and integrity protection for the App/VNF/CNF package, one of the two following options should be followed according to [41], [42]:
Option 1: The App/VNF/CNF package contains a Digest (a.k.a. hash) for each of the artifacts of the App/VNF/CNF package. The table of hashes is signed with the App/VNF/CNF provider private key.
Option 2: The complete App/VNF/CNF package is signed with the App/VNF/CNF provider private key.
The signature verification process comprises the following steps:
Responsible: App/VNF/CNF Provider, Service Provider
A signed App/VNF/CNF package is delivered to the Service Provider containing the App/VNF/CNF package, the signing X.509v3 certificate, and the signature (signed hash value) of App/VNF/CNF Provider.
The root CA certificate must be pre-installed within the NFO for the validation of the App/VNF/CNF Provider signing certificate.
Upon reception of the signed App/VNF/CNF package from App/VNF/CNF Provider by the Service Provider:
New hash(es) of the received App/VNF/CNF package are calculated and verified by the Service Provider against the hash(es) in the signature using the App/VNF/CNF Provider certificate retrieved from the received App/VNF/CNF package.
Verification is successful if both hash values match.
Service Provider signs the verified App/VNF/CNF package prior to its onboarding to the trust O-Cloud images repository
Service Provider computes the hash value of the App/VNF/CNF package and the signature of the App/VNF/CNF Provider.
The hash value is signed with the private key(s) of the Service Provider.
A signed App/VNF/CNF package is onboarded to the O-Cloud images repository containing the App/VNF/CNF package, certificate(s) and signature(s) (signed hash value) of the App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.
During instantiation to the O-Cloud Platform from the trust O-Cloud images repository, the App/VNF/CNF package is authenticated and verified using signatures from both App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider.
Algorithms, key sizes and standards to be used for signature generation/verification must follow the "O-RAN Security Protocol Specification" clause5.1.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-2: Sensitive artifacts shall be encrypted for confidentiality protection
The confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts is ensured by either asymmetric or symmetric Encryption/Decryption:
Confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts during their delivery to the Service Provider
Asymmetric based on public/private key pair
App/VNF/CNF Provider encrypts the sensitive artifacts with the Service Provider public keys
Service Provider decrypts the sensitive artifacts using the private key(s)
Symmetric based on a shared key between App/VNF/CNF Provider and Service Provider that is used to encrypt or decrypt sensitive artifacts
App/VNF/CNF Provider encrypts sensitive artifacts with the shared common key
Service Provider decrypts sensitive artifacts with the same shared common key
Confidentiality protection of the sensitive artifacts during onboarding and instantiation
During onboarding to the trust O-Cloud images repository, NFO encrypts the App/VNF/CNF sensitive artifacts using the appropriate encryption key(s) provided by Service Provider.
Prior to instantiation of the App/VNF/CNF package, the stored App/VNF/CNF sensitive artifacts shall be decrypted. After Service Provider App/VNF/CNF decryption, any signature is verified. The cryptographic key material used for decryption of the App/VNF/CNF Package is provided by the Service Provider.
Algorithms, key sizes and standards to be used for Encryption/Decryption must follow the "O-RAN Security Protocol Specification" clause 5.1.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-3: App/VNF/CNF packages should be compliant with ETSI NFV specifications, ETSI GS NFV-SOL004 [42], ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [43] and ETSI GS NFV-SEC 021 [41] for package formats and signing/verification procedures.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-IMG-4: Encryption shall be used to secure  cryptographic keys used by the cryptographic operations (e.g., Signature generation/verification, Encryption/Decryption, Hashing) for  App/VNF/CNF image protection.
See Annex C for the guidance to implement these controls.

Security Controls
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1 A true chain of trust shall start from the hardware firmware through the virtualization layer to O-RAN Apps/VNFs/CNFs to prevent tampering during the system boot and integrity check on the O-Cloud software layers [50], [52]. The chain of trust should be built from measurements stored in a hardware root of trust using the measure-and-verify security model, with each component measuring, verifying, and launching the next level [52]. Within the hardware root of trust are stored cryptographic keys and measurements (i.e., hash values) of the O-Cloud’s firmware, software, and configuration data.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2 A remote attestation service (AS) should be supported for providing additional benefits beside verifying O-Cloud platform integrity by CoT. The remote AS should collect O-Cloud platform configurations and integrity measurements from data center servers at a O-Cloud service provider via a trust agent service running on the O-Cloud platform servers [58]. The O-Cloud service provider is responsible for defining allowlisted trust policies. These policies should include information and expected measurements for desired platform CoT technologies. The collected data is compared and verified against the policies, and a report is generated to record the relevant trust information in the AS database [58].The remote AS should be extended to include O-RAN Apps/VNFs/CNFs integrity.
See Annex C for the guidance to implement these controls.
AAL
There are two different scenarios of deployment of the hardware accelerator manager:
Scenario 1: the hardware accelerator manager is a SW component part of the O-Cloud platform and outside the hardware accelerator device. It is linked to the hardware accelerator device via a vendor specific interface.
Scenario 2: The hardware accelerator manager is part of the hardware accelerator device. In this scenario, the vendor specific interface does not exist.
For both scenarios, AALI-C-Mgmt interface is the same between the hardware accelerator manager and the O-Cloud IMS/DMS.

SEC-CTL-A1-3: The A1 interface shall support authorization using OAuth 2.0, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], section 4.7.
O1 Interface
O1 Interface connecting the SMO to the Near-RT RIC, one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs.
Requirements
All O1 functions in an O-RAN deployment may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. In order to support the zero trust principles guiding O-RAN security requirements, the O1 interface will enforce confidentiality, integrity, authenticity through an encrypted transport, and least privilege access control using the network configuration access control model.
Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these functions without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations. Unrestricted read operations can reveal sensitive information to unauthorized users. For operators to manage O-RAN functions using NETCONF [9] effectively and securely, they need a standards-based mechanism for role-based access control that integrates with NETCONF. The network configuration access control model (NACM) [10] provides the means to restrict access for users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.
NACM further enables operators need to integrate both authentication and authorization with a centralized access management platform, protect the running configuration from unauthorized modification and deletion, support change management procedures for updating both network function configurations and changes to the NACM instance on a network function.
This chapter specifies the requirements for O1 NACM support post function initialization and when the function is operating normally. NACM requirements related to network function initialization and when repairing broken access control configuration will be addressed in a future release of the document.

Open Fronthaul Interface
C-plane
Introduction
The O-DU sends UL C-plane messages and DL C-plane messages to O-RU to trigger transmission and reception of RF signals. The DL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive DL I/Q data in U-plane messages from O-DU. Likewise, the UL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive RF signal and send UL I/Q data in U-plane messages to O-DU. Any delay of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard U-plane traffic from O-DU and the UE [31].
An adversary can inject its own DL C-plane or UL C-plane messages by spoofing the associated O-DU. As a result, it would block the O-RU from processing the corresponding U-Plane packets received from the O-DU and O-RU respectively, leading to temporary DoS and, limited cell performance on cells served by the O-RU [4]
Requirements
[REQ-SEC-OFCP-1] The C-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange C-plane messages with O-RUs.
Security Controls
Authentication and Authorization of network elements supporting the C-Plane
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-1 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of an O-DU and other network elements supporting the C-Plane within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.
U-plane
Requirements
Open Fronthaul U-plane transports 5G System Control Plane and User Plane messages between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.  The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [32] provides confidentiality and integrity protection of 5G System Control Plane and User Plane between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.
Security Controls
S-plane
Introduction
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks within a PTP network. Within a PTP domain [27], the grandmaster clock is the source of time to which all other PTP clocks in the domain are synchronized.
The IEEE 1588 standard specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the best clock from PTP Network and Local PTP Clock. The BMCA runs on PTP instances in the network continuously and is adjusting to changes in that network. PTP ANNOUNCE messages are used to build a timing distribution hierarchy with grandmaster at the top. There can be many grandmasters in PTP Network, but PTP Domain can have only one. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for providing timing to the PTP slave nodes.
Following the selection of the new grandmaster, the grandmaster begins transmitting the current time within the SYNC message and FOLLOW_UP messages if applicable. This allows the other clocks to synchronize their time to the grandmaster.
S-Plane attacks include an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization. Details are covered in Clause 5.4.1.2 of [4].
The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:
O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.
O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RU’s at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).
Requirements
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-1] The S-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.
NOTE: This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane where authenticated and authorized PTP nodes communicate over the Open Fronthaul network.
NOTE: There is no specific requirement for authentication and authorization mechanism of S-plane PTP messages.
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-2] The S-Plane should provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.
[REQ-SEC-OFSP-3] For the O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model the S-Plane should protect against MITM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [28].
Security Controls
Synchronization Architecture Redundancy
This clause addresses requirement REQ-SEC-OFSP-3 by providing an architectural recommendation to S-plane security based on redundancy in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into to the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-1: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support simultaneous Grandmasters.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-2: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.
O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [30] Clause 8.2.3 Timing/Synchronization Redundancy & Resiliency provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
Authentication and Authorization of PTP nodes
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFSP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFSP-2 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 of this document provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

Security Controls
Open Fronthaul Point-to-Point LAN Segment
The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. These are also known as point-to-point LAN segments [12]. Each end of the Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segment comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, e.g., O-DU, O-RU, etc., as described in [13] and [14].
An Open Fronthaul network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Xhaul Transport Network Elements that share a point-to-point LAN segment with Open Fronthaul network elements are also Open Fronthaul network elements. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, TNE and PRTC-T/GM [13][14][15][26].

NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.
IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network. Port-based network access control in the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprises supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12]  and as further described in this section. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification and are determined by vendor implementation in agreement with operator-specific requirements..SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-1: Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.
Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-2: Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 supplicant functionality [12] for each port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.
Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network
In IEEE 802.1X-2020 a supplicant mutually authenticates with an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-3: Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-4: An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based network access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-5: Port-based network access control between a supplicant and authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall use EAP TLS authentication as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
Authenticator interface to an Authentication Server in the Open Fronthaul Network
IEEE 802.1x describes an EAP-TLS exchange which includes an interface between an authenticator and authentication server. [12]
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-7: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server shall support IETF RADIUS standards, IETF RFC 2865[22], IETF RFC 2866[23], IETF RFC 3579[24], and successor standards.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-8: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server should support IETF Diameter standards, IETF RFC 4072 [25] and successor standards.
NOTE: Mechanisms to secure the interface between the authenticator and authentication server are out of scope of the O-RAN Alliance.

Configuration LLS-C1 [13] and Cascade Mode in the Shared Cell Concept [12] are cases where an O-DU and O-RU are Open Fronthaul network elements in a point-to-point LAN segment.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-6: In the case of Configuration LLS-C1, the O-DU must support the authenticator functionality as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
Authentication and authorization procedure for 802.1x Port based Network Access Control
IEEE 802.1X-2020 is optional to support.
NOTE: Further security requirements for IEEE 802.1X-2020 will continue to be studied. It is intended to evolve IEEE 802.1X-2020 to a mandatory requirement for the Open Fronthaul interface after completion of the study.
General requirements
Only those Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant that have mutually authenticated with an authenticator are authorized to participate in the Open Fronthaul network. If an authenticator port is to be activated in the Open Fronthaul, then the authenticator initially places the port into an unauthorized state that allows EAP over LAN (EAPOL) packets for EAP authentication and blocks all other traffic. If the mutual authentication has been successful and the operator authorizes operation for the network element port, then the port is switched to the authorized state whereby non-EAPOL packets can be sent and received.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-9: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator shall place each of its unauthorized ports into a state that allows EAPOL traffic and block all other Ethernet traffic.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-10: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator should be able to implement authorization policies that apply to its authorized ports. Authorization policies may include tagging authorized traffic with a particular VLAN-ID as it egresses the Open Fronthaul network element and/or enforcing access control policies that restrict the type of traffic able to be forwarded by the Open Fronthaul network element.
Manufacturer Install Certificates
IEEE 802.1X [12] defines encapsulation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Using such an approach, a supplicant implements an EAP method according to its supported credentials. Prior to a supplicant enrolling in an operator’s PKI, a manufacturer installed certificate shall be used together with an EAP-TLS dialogue to enable certificate-based mutual authentication to be performed between an authenticator and a supplicant.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-11: The O-RU shall have installed a Manufacturer Installed X.509 Certificate.
Security Procedure
The following procedure describes the authentication and authorization, based on IEEE 802.1 Port based Network Access Control, of point-to-point LAN segments between a supplicant and another Open Fronthaul network element acting as an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-12: The normal operation procedure shown in Figure 5-2 shall be performed to authenticate and authorize an O-RU within an Open Fronthaul network.
FFS: Identify end-to-end signalling flow for other Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant.
FFS: other operation procedures, to include, but not limited to, procedures to take into account existing operator provided certificates and for upgrading an O-RU to support IEEE 802.1X.

SBOM Guidelines for O-RAN
SBOM Overview
This section provides guidance for generation, delivery, and use of a software bill of materials (SBOM).
SBOM is a fundamental component of a mature Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SBOM is an industry best practice part of secure software development that enhances the understanding of the upstream software supply chain so that vulnerability notifications and updates can be properly and safely handled across the installed customer base.   The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) define SBOM as “a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.” The SBOM documents proprietary and third-party software, including commercial and free and open-source software (FOSS), used in software products.  The SBOM is maintained and used by the software supplier and stored and viewed by the network operator.
Summary of U.S. DoC and NTIA Report
The DoC, in coordination with NTIA, published a report “The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)” [17] that provides guidance on the data fields, automation, and processes to be used by suppliers and customers. Some key points are provided below:
SBOM Data Fields
The SBOM must contain as minimum fields: Supplier Name, Component Name, Version of the Component, Other Unique Identifiers, Dependency Relationship, Author of the SBOM data, and Timestamp.
SBOM Automation
The interoperable data formats used to generate and consume SBOMs must be either Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [18], CycloneDX [19], or Software Identification (SWID) [20] tags.
SBOM Practices
DoC advises that the cryptographic hash and digital signature of the SBOM may be defined in the contractual agreement between the software supplier and customer.
DoC advises the terms for access control to the SBOM may be defined in the contractual agreement between the software supplier and customer.
Depth is the level of upstream suppliers maintained in the SBOM.  DoC advises an SBOM should contain all primary (top level) components, with all their transitive dependencies listed. At a minimum, all top-level dependencies must be listed with enough detail to seek out the transitive dependencies recursively.
The commercial software supplier is not obligated to make the SBOM publicly available.
SBOM Requirements for O-RAN
The SBOM delivery should be made under contractual agreement with specific terms that include the following  requirements and controls.
Requirements
REQ-SBOM-001: The O-RAN vendor shall provide the SBOM with every O-RAN software delivery package, including patches.
REQ-SBOM-002: The minimum set of data fields shall  include: Supplier Name, Component Name, Version of the Component, Other Unique Identifiers as available, Dependency Relationship, Author of the SBOM data, and Timestamp [17].
REQ-SBOM-003: Vulnerabilities shall not be included as an additional data field because it would represent a static view from a specific point in time, while vulnerabilities are constantly evolving.
NOTE: The SBOM should be used by vendors and operators to periodically check against known vulnerability databases to identify potential risk.
NOTE: The level of risk for a vulnerability should be determined by the software vendor and operator with consideration of the software product, use case, and network environment.

Guidance on Security Requirements & Controls
C.1 O-Cloud
Controls given in this section are designed as a guidance and non-normative. The implementation of those non-normative controls depends on the security policies within the O-Cloud Service Provider, O-RAN  App/VNF/CNF provider and Service Provider.
C.1.1 Software Package Protection at the O-Cloud Network Functions and Applications Layer
Potential controls on REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-1 and REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-IMG-4
App/VNF/CNF packages need to be frequently tested throughout the lifecycle of the App/VNF/CNF:
Tools used for static code and dynamic security analysis, analysis of code being released, and penetration test results must be shared with the Service Provider.
C.1.2 Secure storage of cryptographic keys and sensitive data
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-1
The following potential implementation options for encrypting cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the O-Cloud platform could be used. The appropriate option to be used depends on the sensitivity of the data to be protected and needs to be assessed/determined by the Service provider.
Software based:
Software-based KMS vaults supporting management of keys, including creation, rotation, and revocation, as well as encrypting and decrypting sensitive data with managed keys [57].
Use a vTPM: A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) is a software-based representation of a physical Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip to provide secure storage of credentials or keys [62]. A vTPM acts as any other virtual device. It performs the same functions as a TPM, but it performs cryptographic coprocessor capabilities in software. It should comply with the TPM 2.0 specification [61].
Hardware based
Hardware-based key vaults: The use of Key Management Service (KMS) based on an HSM [55], [56], [60]. The data is encrypted using a data encryption key (DEK); a new DEK is generated for each encryption. The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) that is stored and managed in the HSM of the KMS provider.
A hardware TPM [59], [61]. For data encryption, an encryption key is stored on disk but encrypted with the TPM master key (the storage root key (SRK)). This encryption key can only be used after it was decrypted by an authenticated TPM. The actual data encryption/decryption is then done by the main CPU, only decryption/encryption of the encryption key is done inside the TPM.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-2
Overwriting with zero (e.g., /dev/zero) or simple patterns.
Overwriting with random data using:
True random data source (e.g., /dev/random). This solution takes too long to wait for the entropy generation.
Pseudorandom data source (e.g., /dev/urandom) can be used as a reasonable source of pseudorandom data.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-3
Each data center adheres to a strict disposal policy and uses the techniques described to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 “Guidelines for Media Sanitization” [53] and DoD 5220.22-M “National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.” [54].
C.1.3 Chain of Trust
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1
There are many ways to measure platform integrity. In many cases, a hardware security module is used to store measurement data such as a HSM and TPM. Various platform integrity technologies build their own CoTs [58] and listed here below:
UEFI Secure Boot (SB)
Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)
Intel Boot Guard
Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR)
Intel Technology Example Summary
AMD Platform Secure Boot (AMD PSB)
Arm TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for Armv8-A
Arm Secure Boot and the Chain of Trust (CoT)
Cisco Platform Roots of Trust
IBM Chain of Trust (CoT)
For more details, see [58], clause 3.2.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2
Please refer to the following technology examples in [58], clause 6.1 for more information:
Intel Security Libraries for the Data Center (ISecL-DC)
Remote AS - Project Veraison (VERificAtIon of atteStatiON)
IBM Platform Attestation Tooling
Relevant information on the AS is provided in [58], clause 6.1 and [44], clause 6.6.
The following figure shows an example of remote AS:
The AS from the hardware layer to the O-RAN App/VNF/CNF includes the following steps (see figure):
Attestation of the O-Cloud platform
RoT measures and verifies hardware resources (server platform) including firmware/BIOS. It then launches the hardware resources.
The server act as the attester of the OS/virtualization layer. It measures, verifies and launches the OS/virtualization layer.
The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by the management platform (e.g. Kubernetes) acting as the trust agent.
Attestation of App/VNF/CNF
The attestation process is initiated by the management platform requesting to instantiate a new App/VNF/CNF:
The virtualization layer verifies the virtual instance.
Virtualized RoT (vRoT) measures the App/VNF/CNF. The vRoT is a virtual instance associated to the hardware protected RoT. The virtualization layer provides this virtual resource to the virtual instance.
Corresponding measurements are reported to the trust agent. The trust agent exposes the attestation results to authorized attestation server (could be within the SMO) so that it verifies collected measurements against trust policies already defined by administrators.
