Testing methodology

	System under test

SUT refers to the O-Cloud defined in [9]. The main architecture components and interfaces/APIs for the O-Cloud platform software can be found in Figure 4.12.

Figure 4.12: The overview of O-Cloud Interface test

For the Cloud platform, different technologies may be used by cloud vendors,  such as:

VMs only,

Containers only,

Containers in VMs,

both VMs and Containers, OR

other new technologies

so, the O-Cloud should be tested exactly based on the technology used.

Cases applied to each technology are listed in the Annex A.

SUT is identified by an implementation of the function under test producing or consuming the API Under Test (AUT) e.g. in the case of the O2DMS interface the function under test is O-Cloud implementation.

The function is tested in isolation with respect to SMO, O-RAN Network Functions and O-Cloud, to guarantee that the outcomes of the conformance tests are not result of interoperability issues with other components.

Test method

Testing procedure

The SUT and the test tool are set up and connected to the device in strict accordance with the preset conditions of each test case in the specification, and the test steps in the test case are performed step by step. Tester should record in detail the important test information during and after the test and compare and analyze with the expected results. Each test case is independent of each other.

Statistics and analysis of key indicators

The test is performed based on the preset conditions and procedure in the test case. The expected test result is used as the standard to determine whether the test succeeds. If the test result is consistent with the expected result, the test is regarded as passing. Tester may record test result, such as throughput, latency, and device volume.

O-Cloud Notification API Test

General

O-Cloud provides a Notification Framework; it acts as the event producer and exposes APIs to event consumers. The APIs enable the consumers to subscribe event notifications, delete subscriptions, get a list of subscriptions and detail of a subscription, notification to event consumers by pull or push mode.

Event consumers can be applications (e.g. O-DU).

Refer to O-RAN.WG6.O-Cloud Notification API [2], this section describes the test cases for O-Cloud Notification APIs.

Test Configuration

System Under Test requirements

The SUT for the O-Cloud Notification API is the O-Cloud, which provides an O-Cloud notification event producer(EP). This allows Event consumers (EC, such as O-DU or CNF) to subscribe event notifications, delete subscriptions, get a list of subscriptions or detail of a subscription, and receive events/status from cloud infrastructures. Notification to event consumers by pull or push mode.

The test functions are the tools which simulate the workloads (applications running in the cloud) or other entities out of the cloud interested in the events.

Figure 5.21: Configuration of O-Cloud Notification API test

Test Tools and Simulators capabilities

A summary of the recommended testing tools and simulators for functional testing is shown as following.

Postman: Postman is an interface testing tool. Postman is equivalent to a client, which can simulate various HTTP requests initiated by users, send the request data to the server, and obtain the corresponding response results, so as to verify whether the result data in the response matches the expected value. It is mainly used to simulate various HTTP requests (e.g. Get/POST/delete/put). The difference between Postman and browsers is that some browsers can't output Json format, while Postman is more intuitive about the results returned by the interface. In the following test, Postman act as the event consumer, and it can also be configured to received notification from the event producer.

Curl: Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data specified with URL syntax.  It can be used as the event consumer.

HTTPie: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client with an intuitive interface, support for JSON, syntax highlighting, download functionality (like wGET), plugin support, and more. HTTPie consists of a simple HTTP command that is easy to debug and interact with HTTP servers, RESTful apis, and Web Services. It can be used as the event consumer.
