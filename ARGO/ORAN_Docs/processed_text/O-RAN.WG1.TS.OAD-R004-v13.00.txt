O-RAN Overview
Scope and Objectives
O-RAN activities are guided by the following objectives [i.5]:
Leading the industry towards open, interoperable interfaces, RAN virtualization, and big data and AI enabled RAN intelligence.
Maximizing the use of common-off-the-shelf hardware and merchant silicon and minimizing proprietary hardware.
Specifying APIs and interfaces, driving standards to adopt them as appropriate, and exploring open source where appropriate.
The O-RAN Architecture identifies the key functions and interfaces adopted in O-RAN.
General O-RAN Architecture Principles
This clause contains the general O-RAN architecture principles as described below.
The O-RAN architecture, interface specifications, and terminology shall be consistent with 3GPP architecture, interface specifications, and terminology with additions to accommodate O-RAN specific features.
This document represents the O-RAN architecture at the time of its publication and may evolve as deemed appropriate by the O-RAN ALLIANCE.
The O-RAN architecture includes a logical representation of a Radio Access Network (RAN) which extends the 3GPP specified RAN and consists of logical NFs or logical nodes (as per 3GPP TS 38.300 [8] and TR 21.905 [i.1]).
NOTE: Therefore, the terms O-RAN NFs as well as O-RAN nodes are used interchangeably to refer to some of the logical O-RAN entities, according to the context used in that particular statement. In any case, they always refer to a logical entity and not to a physical or cloudified instantiation of an O-RAN NF or an O-RAN node.
O-RAN Architecture
Overall Architecture of O-RAN
Figure 5.1-1 below provides a high-level view of the O-RAN architecture.  It shows that the interfaces – A1, O1, Open Fronthaul M-plane and O2 – connecting SMO (Service Management and Orchestration) framework to O-RAN Network Functions and to O-Cloud. As depicted in this figure, the O-Cloud includes the O-Cloud Notification interface [28] which is available for the relevant O-RAN Network Functions (i.e., Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU) to receive O-Cloud related notifications.
Figure 5.1-1 below also illustrates that the O-RAN Network Functions can be hosted on the O-Cloud or on customized hardware.
All O-RAN NFs, except O-RU, are managed via the O1 interface to an authorized SMO framework.
The O1 interface exposes management services for the O-RAN NFs that are managed individually or together, as specified in the OAM Architecture specification [34].
The Open Fronthaul M-plane interface, between SMO and O-RU, supports the O-RU management in hybrid mode, as specified in [24].
O-RAN NFs instantiated on the O-Cloud may utilize the APIs exposed by the Accelerator Abstraction Layer (AAL) defined in [29].
The Near-RT RIC O-RAN NF in figure below provides RAN analytics information services via the Y1 service interface [39]. These services can be consumed by Y1 consumers after mutual authentication and authorization by subscribing to or requesting the RAN analytics information via the Y1 service interface. Y1 consumers role can be played by entities which are within an PLMN trusted domain. Y1 consumers outside the PLMN trusted domain may use Y1 services in a secure manner via an exposure function, e.g., as in 3GPP TS 23.501, Clause 5.20 [1]. The framework for mutual authentication and authorization between Y1 consumers and the Near-RT RIC is not supported in the present document.
Figure 5.1-1: High Level Architecture of O-RAN
Within the logical architecture of O-RAN, as shown in Figure 5.1-2 below, the radio side includes Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU O-RAN NFs. The E2 interface connects O-eNB to Near-RT RIC.  Although not shown in this figure, the O-eNB does support O-DU and O-RU O-RAN NFs with an Open Fronthaul interface between them. The Near-RT RIC, in the figure below, supports the Y1 service interface towards Y1 consumers. Y1 consumers, unlike the other network elements shown in this figure, does not denote a logical O-RAN function.
As stated earlier, the management side includes SMO Framework containing a Non-RT-RIC function. The O-Cloud, on the other hand, is a cloud computing platform comprising a collection of physical infrastructure nodes that meet O-RAN requirements to host the relevant O-RAN NFs (such as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU etc.), the supporting software components (such as Operating System, Virtual Machine Monitor, Container Runtime, etc.) and the appropriate management and orchestration functions. The virtualization of O-RU is not supported in the present document.
As shown in this figure, the O-RU provides the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface to authorized O-DU in hierarchical mode, or to authorized O-DU and SMO in hybrid mode as specified in [24] and [34].
NOTE: The LLS (O-DU to O-RU interface) specified in Clauses 5.3.5 and 5.3.6 (Split Option 7-2x) is the Open Fronthaul interface described in the O-RAN Open Fronthaul Specification [19]. Other LLS options [i.2] may be considered for reference designs when the relevant interfaces are described in specifications created by related open industry initiatives (e.g., the Small Cell Forum for Split Option 6) or in O-RAN white-box hardware specifications (e.g., Split Option 8).
Figure 5.1-2: Logical Architecture of O-RAN
The following figure shows the Uu interface between UE and O-RAN NFs as well as between UE and O-eNB. As shown in Figure 5.1-3 below, the dotted box denotes all the O-RAN NFs required to support the Uu interface for NR. The O-eNB, on the other hand, terminates the Uu interface for LTE. Please refer to Clause 5.4.17 for more details.
Figure 5.1-3: Uu interface for O-RAN Network Functions and O-eNB
O-RAN Control Loops
The O-RAN architecture supports at least the following control loops involving different O-RAN functionalities:
Non-RT (Non-Real Time) control loops
Near-RT (Near-Real Time) control loops
RT (Real Time) control loops
Figure 5.2-1: O-RAN Control Loops
As shown in Figure 5.2-1 above, the control loops are defined based on the controlling entity and the architecture shows the other logical entities with which the control loop host interacts.
Control loops exist at various levels and run simultaneously. Depending on the use case, they may or may not interact with each other. The use cases for the Non-RT and Near-RT control loops and the interaction between the RICs for these use cases are fully defined by O-RAN Use Cases Detailed Specification [38]. That specification [38] also defines relevant interaction for the O-CU-CP and O-DU control loops, responsible for call control and mobility, radio scheduling, HARQ, beamforming etc. along with slower mechanisms involving SMO management interfaces. 
The timing of these control loops is use case dependent. Typical execution time for use cases involving the Non-RT control loops are 1 second or more; Near-RT control loops are in the order of 10 milliseconds or more; control loops in the E2 Nodes can operate below 10 milliseconds. (e.g., O-DU radio scheduling).
For any specific use case, however, a stable solution would require the loop time in the Non-RT RIC and/or SMO management plane processes to be significantly longer than the loop time for the same use case in the control entities stated above.
Description of O-RAN Architecture Elements
Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)
SMO Architecture Principles
Service Based Architecture (SBA) introduces the roles of service producer and service consumer together with standardized service-based interfaces. These standardized service-based interfaces enable interoperability within the SMO. SBA is not concerned with the implementation, but it defines logical functions in their service producer and consumer roles. When properly applied the SBA approach can enable the following:
Validates produced services with consumer use cases.
Identifies service operations with their information model defining semantic behaviour.
Specifies the API and a data model for a syntactic interface.
Identifies common services that can be produced by a single producer such as those that are commonly used by multiple internal consumers (e.g., authentication, authorization, service registration and discovery, data management, etc.).
SMO Services (SMOSs)
Introduction to SMO Services
In the O-RAN architecture, SMO is responsible for RAN domain management. The SMO description in this architecture document is focused on the SMO services that support the RAN. Following the SBA principles above, the SMO Services produced by the SMO are defined. A SMOF implementation can produce and/or consume any combinations of one or more SMOSs, provided that the SMOF complies with the O-RAN specifications of the interfaces exposing the SMOSs.
The Non-RT RIC SMOF example depicted in the Figure 5.3-1 below shows support for rApps and for A1 related SMOSs. Otherwise, the definition of SMOFs is in general not in scope of the O-RAN specifications, as the interoperable functional behaviour of SMOFs is specified via the SMOS Producer/Consumer roles.
The SMO Services produced by the SMO are:
RAN NF OAM SMO Service, including capabilities such as,
RAN NF Performance Assurance Management (NFPM)
RAN NF Fault Supervision Management (NFFM)
RAN NF Provisioning Management (NFCM)
Others, e.g., Tracing, Logging, etc.
Network Functions Orchestration (NFO) SMOS
Federated O-Cloud Orchestration and Management (FOCOM) SMOS
Service Management and Exposure (SME) SMOS
Data Management and Exposure (DME) SMOS
Topology Exposure and Inventory Management (TE&IV) SMOS
RAN Analytics SMOS
Service & Subnet Slice Orchestration SMOS
Service & Subnet Slice Assurance SMOS
AI/ML workflow (AIMLWF) SMOS
rApp Management SMOS
A1 related SMOSs
Software package onboarding SMOS
Policy Management and Information (PMI).
SME SMOS supports the exposure of other SMOSs, to both internal and external SMOS consumers.
DME SMOS supports the exposure of data produced by SMOS Producers, to both internal and external SMOS consumers.
The SMOSs described in this document are represented in a service-based architecture in the Figure 5.3-1 below.
Figure 5.3-1: SMOSs in the SMO SBA representation
SMO in the O-RAN Architecture
All the SMO Service producers represented in Figure 5.3-1 can also be SMOS consumers.
The SMO consumes services offered by other O-RAN architecture elements through four key southbound interfaces:
A1 Interface between the Non-RT RIC in the SMO and the Near-RT RIC for RAN Optimization.
O1 Interface provides SMO FCAPS support either directly or indirectly between the SMO and the O-RAN Network Functions.
In the hierarchical model, SMO FCAPS support information over O1 to the O-DU which uses the Open FH M-Plane interface to manage the O-RU.
In the hybrid model, SMO provides FCAPS support information over Open FH M-Plane interface between the SMO and the O-RU and over O1 to the O-DU which uses the Open FH M-Plane interface to manage the O-RU.
O2 Interface between the SMO and the O-Cloud to provide O-Cloud resource management and workload management.
Non-RT RIC
Non-RT RIC is the functionality internal to the SMO that supports intelligent RAN optimization by:
enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide policy-based guidance over the A1 interface
enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide enrichment information over the A1 interface
enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide ML model management over the A1 interface
enabling RAN optimization actions through RAN NF OAM SMOS over O1 and Open FH M-Plane interfaces, and NFO and FOCOM SMOSs over O2 interface
Non-RT RIC framework enables rApps which consume and/or produce services over the R1 interface. For more information, refer to [27].
Non-RT RIC supports intelligent RAN optimization control loops through rApps with intervals greater than 1 second.
SMO capabilities extensions
As a flexible extension mechanism, the SMO allows delivery of aspects of RAN management and orchestration functionality via rApps.
External exposure of SMO capabilities and Data
The exposure of SMO capabilities and data to external SMO consumers is done via SME and DME respectively, as represented in an SBA approach depicted in Figure 5.3-2.
Figure 5.3-2: SMO external terminations
Near-RT RIC
Near-RT RIC is an O-RAN NF that enables near real-time control and optimization of services and resources of E2 Nodes via fine-grained data collection and actions over the E2 interface with control loops in the order of 10 ms-1s. The Near-RT RIC hosts one or more xApps that use E2 interface to collect near real-time information (e.g., on a UE basis or a Cell basis) and provide value added services. The Near-RT RIC control over the E2 Nodes is steered via the policies and the enrichment data provided via A1 from the Non-RT RIC. Based on the available data, the Near-RT RIC generates the RAN analytics information and exposes it via Y1 interface.
The functional enhancement provided by the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node is subject to the capability of the E2 Node exposed over the E2 interface by means of the E2 Service Model [25], in order to support the use cases described in  [38]. The E2 service model describes the functions in the E2 Node which may be controlled by the Near-RT RIC and the related procedures. For a function exposed in the E2 Service Model [25], the Near-RT RIC may e.g., monitor, override, or control via policies the behavior of E2 Node.
In the event of a Near-RT RIC failure, the E2 Node shall be able to provide services but there may be an impact to certain optimization capabilities that are provided by the Near-RT RIC.
The Near-RT RIC is composed of a Near-RT RIC platform and one or more xApps [26] and their capabilities are exposed as services. Both the Near-RT RIC platform and an xApp can be a service producer and/or a service consumer, and these services can be accessed via the set of Near-RT RIC APIs as illustrated in Figure 5.3-3.

Following clauses describe the termination points of O-RAN defined interfaces and 3GPP interfaces adopted by O-RAN.
A1 Interface
A1 interface is between Non-RT-RIC and the Near-RT RIC [18].
A1 is the interface between the Non-RT RIC in SMO and the Near-RT RIC function O-RAN NF. A1 interface supports three types of services as defined in [18]:
Policy Management Service
Enrichment Information Service
ML Model Management Service
A1 policies have the following characteristics compared to persistent configuration [18] [38]. A1 policies,
are not critical to traffic;
have temporary validity;
may handle individual UE or dynamically defined groups of UEs;
act within and take precedence over the configuration;
are non-persistent, i.e., do not survive a restart of the Near-RT RIC.
O1 Interface
The O1 interface is used by SMO for the management of the O-RAN NFs as defined in [34] and [31].
O2 Interface
The O2 interface is between the SMO and O-Cloud as introduced in [33]. The O2 interface provides two categories of services – O2 deployment management services (O2dms) and O2 infrastructure management services (O2ims).
E2 Interface
E2 is a logical interface connecting the Near-RT RIC with an E2 Node as defined in [22].
An E2 Node is connected to only one Near-RT RIC.
A Near-RT RIC can be connected to multiple E2 Nodes.
The E2 interface is a control plane interface that provides support for Near-RT RIC Services using E2 Application Protocol and E2 Services Models [22].
O-Cloud Notification Interface
The O-Cloud Notification interface allows event consumer such as an O-DU deployed on O-Cloud to subscribe to events/status from the O-Cloud. The cloud infrastructure will provide event producer to enable cloud workloads to receive events/status that might be known only to the infrastructure.
Open Fronthaul Interface
The Open FH (Fronthaul) Interface is between O-DU and O-RU logical nodes [19] [24]. The Open FH Interface includes the CUS (Control User Synchronization) Plane and M (Management) Plane. In hybrid mode, the Open FH M-Plane interface connects the O-RU to the SMO for FCAPS functionality.
E1 Interface
The E1 interface, as defined by 3GPP, is between the gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP logical nodes [10] [14]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted between the O-CU-CP and the O-CU-UP logical nodes.
F1-c Interface
The F1-c interface, as defined by 3GPP, is between the gNB-CU-CP and gNB-DU logical nodes [10] [16]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted between the O-CU-CP and the O-DU logical nodes, as well as for the definition of interoperability profile specifications.
F1-u Interface
The F1-u interface, as defined by 3GPP, is between the gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU logical nodes [10] [16]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted between the O-CU-UP and the O-DU logical nodes, as well as for the definition of interoperability profile specifications.
NG-c Interface
The NG-c interface, as defined by 3GPP, is between the gNB-CU-CP and the AMF in the 5GC [8]. It is also referred as N2 in [8]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted between the O-CU-CP and the 5GC.
NG-u Interface
The NG-u interface, as defined by 3GPP, is between the gNB-CU-UP and the UPF in the 5GC [8]. It is also referred as N3 in [8]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted between the O-CU-UP and the 5GC.
X2-c Interface
The X2-c interface is defined in 3GPP for transmitting control plane information between eNBs or between eNB and en-gNB in EN-DC as specified in [6] and [8].  In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted for the definition of interoperability profile specifications.
X2-u Interface
The X2-u interface is defined in 3GPP for transmitting user plane information between eNBs or between eNB and en-gNB in EN-DC as specified in [6] and [8].  In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted for the definition of interoperability profile specifications.
Xn-c Interface
The Xn-c interface is defined in 3GPP for transmitting control plane information between gNBs, ng-eNBs or between ng-eNB and gNB as specified in [8] and [12]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted for the definition of interoperability profile specifications.
Xn-u Interface
The Xn-u interface is defined in 3GPP for transmitting user plane information between gNBs, ng-eNBs or between ng-eNB and gNB as specified in [8] and [12]. In O-RAN, it reuses the principles and protocol stack defined by 3GPP but is adopted for the definition of interoperability profile specifications.
Uu Interface
The UE to eNB/gNB interface in 3GPP is denoted as the Uu interface. The Uu is a complete protocol stack from L1 to L3 and as such, seen as a whole, it terminates in the NG-RAN. If the NG-RAN is decomposed, different protocols terminate at different reference points and none of them has been defined by O-RAN. Since the Uu messages still flow from the UE to the intended eNB/gNB managed function, it is not shown in the O-RAN architecture as a separate interface to a specific managed function. For more information on the Uu interface between the UE and the NG-RAN, please refer to Clauses 5.2 and 5.3 of [10].
CTI (Cooperative Transport Interface)
Interface between the O-DU and TN to dynamically control bandwidth allocations to TUs when using a shared point-to-multipoint transport network. The CTI is specified in [20] and [21].
Y1 Interface
Y1 service interface [39] allows the Y1 consumers to subscribe or request the RAN analytics information provided by Near-RT RIC.
R1 Interface
The R1 interface is a service-based interface between the rApps and the Non-RT RIC framework via which R1 services can be produced and consumed as specified in O-RAN TS Non-RT RIC Architecture [27].
The producers of R1 services can be part of the Non-RT RIC and/or the SMO Framework. R1 services are specified in O-RAN TS R1GAP [35].
Near-RT RIC APIs
The Near-RT RIC APIs are a set of service-based interfaces that can be produced and consumed by the Near-RT RIC Platform and xApps as specified in O-RAN TS Near-RT RIC Architecture [26].
UE Associated Identifiers Used in O-RAN
As described earlier (Clauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2), the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC enable intelligent RAN optimization via A1, O1 and E2 interfaces respectively.
To support intelligent RAN optimization, the Non-RT RIC with rApps and Near-RT RIC with xApps utilize the knowledge of different UE associated events reported by the O-RAN NFs (excluding O-RU) over E2 and O1 interfaces. Both the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC may need to correlate different UE associated events reported by the O-RAN functions for the same UE. In order to facilitate this correlation task, the reporting O-RAN NF includes a set of UE associated identifiers with any report containing UE specific information.
The Table 5.5-1 below shows the set of UE associated identifiers to be reported by any O-RAN NF (excluding O-RU) over O1 and E2 interfaces for any UE associated information.
Table 5.5-1: UE Associate Identifiers used in O-RAN
Additionally, the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC may initiate messages towards the O-RAN NFs which are associated with specific UEs. In such cases, the Non-RT RIC and Near RT RIC may include one or more of the UE associated identifiers specified in the Table 5.5-1 above with any UE associated messages over A1 and E2 interface for identification of the UE in the O-RAN NFs.
O-RAN Security Architecture
The goals of the O-RAN ALLIANCE are to achieve a secure, open, and interoperable RAN. Building upon security advancements from the 3GPP and IETF standards development organizations, the O-RAN ALLIANCE specifies an O-RAN security architecture with the goal to enable 5G CSPs (Communication Service Provider) to deploy and operate O-RAN with the same, or higher level of confidence as a 3GPP-specified RAN. The O-RAN ALLIANCE is strengthening O-RAN’s security posture by specifying security requirements and security controls that mitigate risk across its attack surface while pursuing the goals of a ZTA (Zero-Trust Architecture).
The O-RAN security architecture is specified in the following two O-RAN Technical Specifications:
Security Protocols Specifications [36]
Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [37]
The above TSs [36] and [37] include specifications for configuration and cipher suites with use of the following security protocols on O-RAN interfaces to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity: SSHv2 (Secure Shell 2.0), TLS 1.2 and 1.3, DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) 1.2, IPsec (Internet Protocol Security), OAuth 2.0, CMPv2, IEEE 802.1X, and NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) over Secure Transport.
O-RAN has also provided requirements for SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) in [37].
The test cases to verify proper security implementation of O-RAN security architecture is specified in the O-RAN Technical Specification:
O-RAN Security Tests Specifications [32]
The threats to the O-RAN architecture and the risk assessment are documented in the TR:
O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment [i.4]
The security threat modeling and risk analysis is used to derive the security requirements and security controls in the Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [37]. The O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment TR [i.4] considers external and internal threats to achieve a ZTA.  In addition, security analysis TRs are maintained for O-RAN NFs and features.  These TRs help to drive the requirements in the O-RAN security specifications.
NOTE: Internal and external threats are considered in a ZTA, as defined in NIST SP 800-207 [i.6].  Achieving a ZTA is an incremental process, as identified by the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [i.7].  The O-RAN ALLIANCE is continuing to pursue a ZTA as the O-RAN architecture, threats, and controls evolve.
O-RAN Information Model (IM) Principles
O-RAN shall align its Information Model (IM) with 3GPP to the extent possible. The additional O-RAN extensions to its IM and DMs (Data Model) are described in [30].
Annex A (Informative): Implementation Options of O-RAN Functions and Network Elements
Shared Cell
Shared cell [19] is defined as the operation for the same cell by several O-RUs with one or multiple component carriers. It can be deployed in either FHM (Fronthaul Multiplexer) or Cascade mode as described below.
In FHM mode, the shared cell may be realized by placing an FHM function between an O-DU and several O-RUs that may have one or multiple component carriers from these O-RUs. FHM function may be modelled as an O-RU with LLS Fronthaul support (same as normal O-RU) along with the copy and combine function (additional to normal O-RU), but without radio transmission/reception capability. The Figure A.1-1 below shows how each O-RU can be used for either operating in the same cell (Single Cell Scenario) or in different cells (Multiple Cells Scenario) by configuring the FHM function.
Figure A.1-1: Shared cell deployment using FHM mode
In Cascade mode, the shared cell is realized by several O-RUs cascaded in chain. In this case, one or more O-RUs are inserted between the O-DU and the O-RU. The O-RUs in the cascaded chain except for the last O-RU support Copy and Combine function. Figure A.1-2 below shows an implementation of Cascade mode shared cell.
Figure A.1-2: Shared cell deployment using Cascade mode
The Cascade mode, as described above, is implemented within the O-RU.
Please refer to [19] for additional information.
FHGW Function
The FHGW (Fronthaul Gateway) function may be placed between the O-DU and RU/RRU (Radio Unit / Remote Radio Unit) with the following O-RAN specified interfaces:
The interface between O-DU and FHGW function is Open Fronthaul (Option 7-2x).
The interface between FHGW function and RU/RRU is subject to reference implementation developed by any relevant O-RAN WG (e.g., WG7) as described in [23].
The interface between FHGW function and RU/RRU does not support Open Fronthaul (Option 7-2x).
The FHGW function may be packaged with other functions (such as Ethernet switching) in a physical product, as considered within WG7.
The Figure A.2-1 below depicts the deployment of the FHGW function using O-RAN specified interfaces.
Figure A.2-1: Deployment of O-DU and RU/RRU using FHGW function
Near-RT RIC
The Near-RT RIC can control multiple E2 Nodes or can control a single E2 Node. The following figures show two implementation options of Near-RT RIC.
Figure A.3-1: Centralized Near-RT RIC Serving 4G and 5G Simultaneously
Figure A.3-2: Distributed Near-RT RIC
Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU
Although the O-RAN architecture specifies the O-RAN NFs Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU as separate O-RAN architecture elements, it is possible in the implementation to aggreagate some or all of these O-RAN NFs, and thus collapsing some of the internal interfaces, e.g., F1-c, F1-u, E1, and E2. At least the following implementation options are possible:
Disaggregated O-RAN NFs as per O-RAN architecture
Aggregate O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP
Aggregate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU
Aggregate Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, and O-CU-UP
Aggregate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU
Aggregate O-DU and O-RU
Aggregate Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU
Aggregation of O-RAN NFs is supported by the O-RAN specified interfaces O1 and E2. For the O1 interface, the aggregated O-RAN NFs will be managed as separate Managed Functions belonging to a single Managed Element as specified in [34]. For the E2 interface the aggregated O-RAN NFs can be exposed as part of the E2 Service Model towards the Near-RT RIC (see Annex A in [22]).
Please see the figures (i.e., Figure A.4-1 through Figure A.4-7) below.

Figure A.4-6: Aggregated O-DU and O-RU
Figure A.4-7: Aggregated Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU
Cooperative Transport
To enhance the resource utilization and reduce the latency of UL LLS traffic when using a shared point-to-multipoint transport network requiring resource allocation (such as PON or DOCSIS), the O-RAN architecture supports a cooperative transport feature. The cooperative transport feature is based on the O-DU’s knowledge of the expected uplink LLS traffic from a given O-RU which is provided to the associated (PON or DOCSIS) TN in the transport network. This enables the TN to dynamically allocate the correct bandwidth over the shared transport network to the TU that is used by the O-RU. The CTI signaling is described in [20]. To support the CTI, the O-DU is configured over the O1 interface with CTI client specific configuration as described in [21]. When there are intermediate nodes between the O-DU and the TN, they will forward the CTI messages transparently but will not participate in CTI interactions.
A simplified architecture of the CTI is shown in figure A.5-1 below. The SMO, O-DU and O1 interface shown in this figure are part of the O-RAN Architecture (please see Clauses 5.3.1, 5.3.5, and 5.4.3, respectively), whereas the TN and Transport OAM, are the components of the transport network. For detailed specification and reference architecture, please see [20] and [21].
