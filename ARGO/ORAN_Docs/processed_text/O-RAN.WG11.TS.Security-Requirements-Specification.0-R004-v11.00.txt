A1 Enrichment information (EI): Information utilized by Near-RT RIC that is collected or derived at SMO/Non-RT RIC either from non-network data sources or from network functions themselves.
Account and Identity Events: Events generated by user identification and access control.
Adversarial training: A general method that augments the training data with adversarial examples generated iteratively during training using their correct labels. The stronger the adversarial attacks for generating adversarial examples are, the more resilient the trained model becomes [i.20].
AI/ML model: An algorithm that applies AI/ML techniques to produce model output data based on model input data. (see [37] clause 3.1).
Application descriptor: A template that defines the characteristics and requirements of the Application, allowing it to be deployed, managed, and orchestrated within the O-Cloud. It typically includes information such as the Application's functional behaviour, deployment requirements, resource needs (such as CPU, memory, and storage), connectivity requirements, performance metrics, scalability options, and any dependencies or prerequisites. It also contains information related to security, including the service availability requirements and access rules for controlling the traffic direction to the Application.
Application Events: Events generated by O-RAN Network Functions.
Application package: Software package of xApps, rApps, and VNFs/CNFs (i.e., O-CU, O-DU, and Near-RT RIC).
Audit Records: "Audit records contain security event information such as successful and failed authentication attempts, file accesses, security policy changes, account changes (e.g., account creation and deletion, account privilege assignment), and use of privileges. OSs typically permit system administrators to specify which types of events should be audited and whether successful and/or failed attempts to perform certain actions should be logged." Defined in NIST SP 800-92 [58], clause 2.1.2.
black-side: Identifies the Ethernet Data Encryption device (EDE) port that uses MACsec to protect transmitted frames and verify received frames.
Common Port: An instance of the MAC Internal Sublayer Service (ISS) used by the MAC Security Entity (SecY) to provide transmission and reception of frames for both the controlled and uncontrolled ports.
Controlled Port: The access point used to provide the secure MAC Service to a client of a MAC Security Entity (SecY).
Data Access Event: Events generated by any O-RAN component accessing, retrieving, modifying, or deleting data in files or databases.
Data Sanitization: Removing all the sensitive parts of the data before using it for training makes it impossible for intruders to extract the data from the trained model [i.18].
E2: Interface connecting the Near-RT RIC and one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs.
E2 Node: a logical node terminating E2 interface. In this version of the specification, O-RAN nodes terminating E2 interface are:
-	for NR access: O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU or any combination.
-	for E-UTRA access: O-eNB.
End-to-End MACsec: MACsec is enabled at the Open Fronthaul endpoints, providing encryption for remote endpoints, while intermediary switches and TNE remain MACsec-unaware.
Entity: An individual (person), device, or process that interacts with an ORAN component.
Ethernet Data Encryption device (EDE): A two-port bridge that transmits and receives frames that are assumed to be unprotected to and from one red-side port, and conditionally relays those frames to and from its other black-side port, protecting and verifying frames transmitted and received on the black-side port using MACsec.
External Interface: The interface between the SMO and an External System.
External System: A data source outside the O-RAN domain that provides enrichment data to the SMO.
FCAPS: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security.
Feature: In the AI/ML context, a feature is a measurable property of some data sample that is used as input for an ML model for training and inference. A feature should have predictive power for the model it is being used in.[i.19]
Feature Scaling: Feature scaling in AI/ML is a data preprocessing technique (i.e., using suitable mathematical transformations) used to standardize the range of independent features present in a dataset. By suitable Feature Scaling, the impact of variations in the data on the Model’s output is reduced.
General Security Event: Events generated by the enabling, disabling or configuration of security features in O-RAN components.
Hop-by-Hop MACsec: MACsec is enabled at the Open Fronthaul endpoints and TNEs providing point-to-point encryption at every hop in the Open Fronthaul network.
Information Security Event: "Identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of information security policy or failure of controls, or a previously unknown situation that can be security relevant." Defined in ISO/IEC 27000:2018 [57], clause 3.30.
Information Security Incident: "Single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security." Defined in ISO/IEC 27000:2018 [57], clause 3.31.
Intents: A declarative policy to steer or guide the behaviour of RAN functions, allowing the RAN function to calculate the optimal result to achieve stated objective.
Isolation: A security strategy that separates individual applications or software components from one another, ensuring that they run independently and do not interfere with each other's operations.
Log: "A log is a record of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and networks. Logs are
composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred
within a system or network." Defined in NIST SP 800-92 [58], clause 2.
Log streaming: In information technology, log streaming refers to the near real-time transmission and analysis of log data generated by various software applications, systems, or devices.
MAC Security Entity (SecY): The entity that operates the MAC Security protocol within a system.
Management and Orchestration Event: Events generated by SMO operations.
Model splitting: Model splitting includes the ability to distribute different parts of an AI/ML model across multiple nodes or domains, ensuring that no single node has access to the complete model. This approach can help mitigate the risk of model theft, data leakage, and unauthorized access.
Near-RT RIC: O-RAN near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller: a logical function that enables real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained data collection and actions over E2 interface.
Network Events: Events generated by network activity from operating systems, hypervisors, or container engines.
Non-RT RIC: O-RAN non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller: a logical function that enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources, AI/ML workflow including model training and updates, and policy-based guidance of applications/features in Near-RT RIC.
O-CU: O-RAN Central Unit: a logical node hosting O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP
O-Cloud Compute Pool: It refers to a cohesive set of computational resources within the O-Cloud infrastructure where multiple nodes work in harmony to provide a unified environment designed to host and manage O-RAN applications and services. In the context of Kubernetes, an O-Cloud Compute Pool is equivalent to a "cluster".
O-Cloud data storage: The Storage resource of the O-Cloud Node (Refer clause 3.4.3.5.5 of [6])O-Cloud instance ID: The O-Cloud instance ID is a unique identifier assigned to components within the O-Cloud platform, including VMs, pods, containers, nodes, and compute pools (E.g., a cluster in Kubernetes). This ensures uniqueness across the entire O-Cloud environment, irrespective of the component type. For instance, a VM, a pod, a container, a node, and a cluster will each have a distinct O-Cloud instance ID within the platform, ensuring that there is no ambiguity in identification.
O-Cloud nodes: An O-Cloud node refers to a computational unit or entity within the O-Cloud infrastructure. It serves as a host for running O-RAN applications. Each O-Cloud node contributes computational resources, storage, and networking capabilities to the overall O-Cloud system, ensuring scalability, redundancy, and efficient workload distribution.
O-Cloud platform software component: A software module within the O-Cloud platform that provides essential functionalities and services to enable the deployment, management, and utilization of O-Cloud resources by O-RAN Network Functions. Some examples of O-Cloud platform software component include virtual machine managers, container orchestration frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes control plane) and database services.
O-Cloud secure environment: The O-Cloud secure environment is a logically defined and controlled boundary within the O-Cloud platform, designed to protect all sensitive information and operations. It leverages a combination of hardware-based and software-based security measures to defend against unauthorized access, tampering, and data leakage.
O-CU-CP: O-RAN Central Unit – Control Plane: a logical node hosting the RRC and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol.
O-CU-UP: O-RAN Central Unit – User Plane: a logical node hosting the user plane part of the PDCP protocol and the SDAP protocol.

rApp instance: An individual occurrence of an application running in the Non-RT RIC runtime environment. [37]
rApp instance identifier: A unique identifier for each rApp instance, assigned by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework during rApp registration. [37].
red-side: Identifies the Ethernet Data Encryption device (EDE) port that does not use MACsec to protect transmitted frames or verify received frames.
Relevant Features: Relevant Features are individual measurable properties or characteristics of a data sample that have a significant impact on the model's ability to make accurate predictions or classifications. These features are directly linked to the target variable or outcome the model is trying to predict.
Security Controls: A solution designed to meet a set of defined security requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of O-RAN elements.
Security Log: A log that contains audit records and security-related system events.
Sensitive: A descriptor of information whose loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or modification could adversely affect security [i.12].

The Telco Operator might act as the O-Cloud Provider (in case of private cloud model), or they might be two different entities (in case of hybrid or public cloud models).
System Events: "System events are operational actions performed by OS components, such as shutting down the system or starting a service. Typically, failed events and the most significant successful events are logged, but many OSs permit administrators to specify which types of events will be logged. The details logged for each event also vary widely; each event is usually timestamped, and other supporting information could include event, status, and error codes; service name; and user or system account associated with an event." Defined in NIST SP 800-92 [58], clause 2.1.2.
Time of Day (ToD): Within the O-Cloud, ToD represents the precise hour, minute, and second of a day, serving as a unified time reference across the infrastructure. This consistent time reference is essential to ensure that all nodes hosting O-RAN applications, operate in synchronization. Accurate ToD alignment in the O-Cloud is vital for tasks like event logging, data processing, and transaction sequencing, ensuring operational consistency and reliability across the entire O-Cloud environment.
Uncontrolled Port: The access point used to provide the insecure MAC Service to a client of a MAC Security Entity (SecY).

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-8A: The Near-RT RIC shall support TLS as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.2, in order to provide confidentiality, integrity and replay protection for the A1 interface.
Security controls for the Y1 interface protocol structure solution 1
The Y1 interface protocol structure solution 1 is defined in the O-RAN ALLIANCE TS: "Y1 interface: General Aspects and Principles" [66], clause 7.2.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-9: The Near-RT RIC shall support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication via X.509v3 certificates for the Y1 interface protocol structure solution 1, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.2.
NOTE 1:	In mTLS, both the client (the Y1 consumer) and the server (the Y1 provider) require a certificate, and both sides authenticate each other using their public/private key pair.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-10: The Near-RT RIC shall support the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework for the Y1 interface protocol structure solution 1 as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7, in the role of a resource owner / resource server (producer).

This xApp ID is used in xApp’s API request messages to the Near-RT RIC platform to facilitate the Near-RT RIC platform the identification of the xApp (API service consumer).
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-12: The xApp ID shall be embedded into the provided xApp X.509 certificate used for authentication (mTLS) according to the parametrization in [3], issued by operator RA/CA PKI infrastructure.
NOTE 1:	The security procedure to become part of the existing xApp registration procedure, specified in O-RAN ALLIANCE TS: "Near-RT RIC Architecture" [33], clause 9.1.4 where xApp ID is assigned, is detailed in the Figure 5.1.3.2-1.

Figure 5.1.3.2-1: Security procedure for xApp registration
1. As a pre-requisite to the registration procedure, the xApp obtains information from a provisioning system (NFO in SMO) during the onboarding/deployment phase in the infrastructure. This information is used to authenticate and establish a secure TLS communication with the Near-RT RIC platform during the registration process. The information includes details of the Near-RT RIC platform (address, Root CA certificate) and includes an initial registration credential.
NOTE 2: 	An OAuth 2.0 access token is provided as initial registration credential in the example. Other types of credentials in the initial registration can be used.
2. The xApp and Near-RT RIC platform establish a TLS session (server-side certificate authentication) using the information obtained in step 1.
3. The xApp generates the private and public key pair, and CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
4. After successful establishment of the TLS session, the xApp instance sends a registration request message to the Near-RT RIC platform along with the pre-provisioned initial registration credential (OAuth 2.0 token), and the xApp instance CSR message.
5. The Near-RT RIC platform shall validate the initial registration credential, and the Management Function of the platform shall generate an xApp ID for that particular xApp instance. At the reception of the CSR message from the xApp, the Registration Authority (RA), implemented in the Near-RT RIC platform, shall prove that the xApp instance is in possession of the private key. If the proof of possession procedure is positive, the RA shall configure a policy to add the xApp ID in the Subject Alt Name (SAN) field of the certificate request message to be forwarded to the Operator CA to fetch the end entity certificate.
NOTE 3:	The RA may use an enrolment protocol to fetch the certificate from the CA. The authentication mechanism between RA and CA are part of the operator PKI implementation.
6. The RA requests the certificate for the xApp instance.
7. Operator CA issues a certificate, embedding the xApp ID in SAN field of the certificate. The issued certificate by the operator CA will be used by the xApp for subsequent authentication and authorization procedures between the xApp and the Near-RT RIC platform when services/resources are consumed by xApps via APIs.
8. The Near-RT RIC platform (Management Function) generates an xApp Managed Object Instance (MOI) as specified in [33], which may contain the mechanism for authentication (mTLS) and authorization (OAuth 2.0) between the xApp and the corresponding module of the Near-RT RIC platform.
9. The Near-RT RIC platform (Management Function) responds with a xApp registration response message. The response shall include the assigned xApp ID, authentication, and authorization mechanism (if provided in step 8) and xApp certificate.
SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-13: The data type of the xApp ID shall be a string that uniquely identifies the xApp instance. The format of this string shall be a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) version 4 as described in IETF RFC 4122 [77].

Security Controls
SEC-CTL-O-CLOUD-HW-1: Void
O-Cloud instance ID
Introduction
The following set of requirements and controls outlines the essential criteria concerning the O-Cloud instance ID. This ID is a cornerstone for uniquely identifying and managing various components, including VMs, pods, containers, nodes, and compute pools within the O-Cloud platform. Safeguarding its global uniqueness, preserving its confidentiality and integrity, and controlling its accessibility are crucial to prevent conflicts, unauthorized access, and potential system compromises.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-1: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be unique within the O-Cloud platform to prevent conflicts and ensure accurate identification.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-2: The O-Cloud instance ID shall not be exposed in public-facing interfaces, APIs, or logs without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-3: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be protected to ensure confidentiality and integrity, both during storage (at rest) and while being transmitted (in transit).
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-4: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be subject to auditing and monitoring, with detailed logs maintained to track activities related to the instance's creation, usage, modification, and deletion.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-5: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be associated with a single component, be it a VM, container, pod, node, or compute pool, to ensure clear resource ownership, traceability, and accountability.
Security Controls
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-INST-ID-1: O-Cloud instance IDs shall be generated using strong randomization methods to ensure a high degree of uniqueness and minimize the likelihood of collisions.
EXAMPLE:	Implementation (Kubernetes-specific)
Kubernetes generates unique instance IDs, called Pod names, by combining factors like pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and contextual information. PRNGs use an initial seed and deterministic algorithms to produce random-like numbers. These numbers, along with contextual elements like timestamps and namespace identifiers, form the basis of the Pod names. This approach ensures that generated names are non-guessable, unpredictable, and unlikely to collide within the Kubernetes cluster. The combination of PRNGs, randomization, and context guarantees that instance IDs are secure, unique, and suitable for identifying pods within the system.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-INST-ID-2: O-Cloud should validate newly generated instance IDs against existing IDs to guarantee uniqueness before finalizing instance creation.
Time Synchronization and Consistency Requirements for O-Cloud
Introduction
The requirements listed below highlight the O-Cloud's focus on creating a secure time synchronization framework with NTP as the focus. The requirement and security controls below in this clause are not applicable to PTP. By ensuring each node of the O-Cloud connects to a trusted and authenticated time source, O-Cloud aims to enhance its defences against threats such as clock manipulation, data inconsistencies and operational disruptions.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-1: All O-Cloud nodes shall be configured to connect to a secure and authenticated time synchronization server for ToD synchronization.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-2: The O-Cloud shall be configured such that ToD synchronization is maintained across all nodes in an O-Cloud compute pool, there by guaranteeing uniform time references for all applications hosted on these nodes.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-3: The O-Cloud shall guarantee that the timestamp consistency is preserved even when applications are relocated across different nodes of the O-Cloud infrastructure.
NOTE 1:	Timestamp refers to:
Log/event timestamps: These are associated with each log entry generated. Examples include application start/stop, application relocation, node failures, network events, change in applications and O-Cloud configuration, resource allocation, deallocation, etc.
Data Transaction timestamps: For applications that rely on time-sensitive data within O-Cloud, consistent timestamps are crucial. Whenever data is read, written, or modified, a timestamp is generated to ensure both data integrity and consistency across nodes.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-4: The O-Cloud shall guarantee that various instances of an identical application, irrespective of their location, generate logs with consistent timestamps.
NOTE 2:	Within the O-Cloud infrastructure, a "consistent timestamp" denotes the synchronized and uniform chronological markers generated by various instances of an identical application, irrespective of their location. This uniformity ensures that aggregated or analysed logs from different instances present a coherent chronological sequence, aiding in precise event correlation and analysis. To achieve and maintain this consistency, it's recommended for O-Cloud to synchronize its internal clocks with trusted time sources, such as NTP servers, guaranteeing both the accuracy and trustworthiness of these timestamps.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-5: All O-Cloud nodes within a compute pool, especially those serving a specific geographic region or co-located, shall be configured to operate using a consistent time reference, preferably UTC with a Time Zone (TZ) modifier.
NOTE 3:	This requirement ensures:
Uniformity in Time-Related Operations: Simplifies the process of correlating logs, events, and time-sensitive operations across nodes, aiding in quicker identification of anomalies or malicious activities.
Operational Consistency: Ensures that scheduled tasks, backups, updates, or maintenance activities are executed consistently across the compute pool.
Data Integrity: Provides consistency for applications and databases that rely on timestamps for transactions, ensuring no discrepancies due to time differences.
Security Controls
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-TS-1: The O-Cloud shall ensure that all nodes are configured to exclusively connect to a secure and authenticated time synchronization server for Time of Day (ToD) synchronization.
EXAMPLE 1:	NTP Usage
The O-Cloud should primarily use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) for general time synchronization needs, ensuring consistent timestamps for operations such as logging security events. This connection should prioritize the use of NTP with authentication mechanisms in place to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the time data. The authentication mechanisms provided by NTPv4 should be employed for NTP. This includes the use of symmetric key cryptography to authenticate the time server. Additionally, consideration will be given to implementing NTP over MACsec to enhance security, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the time synchronization data.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-TS-2: All O-Cloud nodes shall be configured to synchronize their clocks exclusively with centralized time servers at regular intervals to ensure uniformity in time-related operations and data across the O-Cloud infrastructure.
EXAMPLE 2:	Time synchronization protocol such as NTP can be used to achieve this consistency.
NTP: While NTP provides millisecond-level accuracy, it's widely adopted and can be sufficient for many applications in the O-Cloud. The reference points here would be the stratum 1-time servers or atomic clocks that NTP servers synchronize with.
SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-TS-3: The O-Cloud should establish multiple time servers for redundancy. This ensures that nodes can switch to an alternative trusted server if the primary server becomes unavailable, thereby maintaining consistent time synchronization.
EXAMPLE 3:	NTP Redundancy
By configuring nodes to have a list of NTP servers, they can automatically switch to a secondary or tertiary server if the primary server fails. This ensures continuous time synchronization and mitigates the risk of a single point of failure.
NOTE:	See clause 5.3.8.9.2 for additional security controls.
Security policies enforcement
Introduction
The following security requirements apply to the O-Cloud to enforce security policies that may be defined in deployment descriptors.
The activation or deactivation of these security policies is operator dependent, making their support mandatory but their use optional depending on operational needs.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-2: The O-Cloud Platform should enforce resource quotas and limits by ensuring that the specified quotas and limits in the deployment descriptor are applied and maintained at each container or VM level.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-3: The O-Cloud Platform should ensure that containers and VMs run with restricted privileges, preventing any processes from having elevated privileges unless explicitly required and approved.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-4: The O-Cloud Platform should allow only approved storage resource types to be mounted for containers and VMs.
NOTE 1: In the context of containers, storage resources refer to volumes. In the context of VMs, storage resources refer to disks or storage drives.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-5: The O-Cloud Platform should enforce that containers and VMs use a read-only root file system, preventing modifications to critical system files during runtime.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-6: The O-Cloud Platform should enforce immutability by ensuring that containers and VMs are always deployed using the latest verified images from trusted image repositories, preventing the reuse of cached images on nodes.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-7: The O-Cloud Platform should enforce defined network policies to manage and control ingress and egress traffic, ensuring that only authorized traffic is permitted within and across the O-Cloud infrastructure.
REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SECPOL-8: The O-Cloud Platform should enforce workload placement policies.
NOTE 1:
For containers, this can be achieved using taint and toleration policies.
For VMs, this can be enforced through resource scheduling policies or affinity/anti-affinity rules.
EXAMPLE: This requirement could, for instance, ensure that an O-DU is scheduled on a node that supports the required AAL, or that O-DU is deployed on a node equipped with a TPM for secure operations.
NOTE 2: The implementation of security policies depends on the underlying technology, whether it involves containerization or virtualization. Guidance for implementing these security policies using Kubernetes admission controllers is provided in Annex C.1.3, based on Kubernetes and OpenShift documentation [i.21], [i.22].

Open Fronthaul Interface
C-plane
Introduction
The O-DU sends UL C-plane messages and DL C-plane messages to O-RU to trigger transmission and reception of RF signals. The DL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive DL I/Q data in U-plane messages from O-DU. Likewise, the UL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive RF signal and send UL I/Q data in U-plane messages to O-DU. Any delay of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard U-plane traffic from O-DU and the UE [31].
An adversary can inject its own DL C-plane or UL C-plane messages by spoofing the associated O-DU. As a result, it would block the O-RU from processing the corresponding U-Plane packets received from the O-DU and O-RU respectively, leading to temporary DoS and, limited cell performance on cells served by the O-RU [i.14]. Additionally, it may tamper with Downlink (DL) C-Plane messages to exploit possible vulnerabilities in the C-Plane protocol or C-Plane endpoint implementation. This can cause an active cell to become a sleeping cell, leading to cell unavailability and a temporary Denial-of-Service (DoS).
Attackers may overwhelm a target system's network bandwidth or computing resources by flooding it with a massive volume of traffic known as volumetric Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack causing Bandwidth Exhaustion, Network Consumption, and Resource Consumption.
An adversary can engage in passive monitoring to monitor the beamforming information for reconnaissance purposes. The flow indicator (eAxCID) in clear text allows an attacker to target a user at a specific location, potentially planning attacks based on the user's known location.
The clear text nature of the C-Plane messages over the ethernet exposes the open-fronthaul to the threats described above.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OFCP-1: The C-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange C-plane messages with O-RUs.
REQ-SEC-OFCP-2: The O-DU shall be able to detect and defend against application level attacks across the C-Plane messages with O-RUs, due to misbehaviour or malicious intent.
REQ-SEC-OFCP-3: Authenticity-, integrity and anti-replay protection should protect C-Plane data flows through the fronthaul network.
REQ-SEC-OFCP-4: The C-Plane data should be confidentiality protected.
Security Controls
Authentication and Authorization of network elements supporting the C-Plane
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-1 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of nodes that exchange C-Plane messages.

This clause provides controls for requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-3 and REQ-SEC-OFCP-4 based on the use of MACsec [79].
SEC-CTL-OFCP-1: The Open Fronthaul network elements should secure the C-Plane data by encapsulating it inside MACsec [79].
Clause 5.2.5.6 of this document provides the solutions for protection of Open Fronthaul messages and defines the security controls for encryption of the C-Plane data on the Open Fronthaul network segment.
U-plane
Introduction
Open Fronthaul U-plane transports 3GPP Access Stratum (AS) Control Plane and User Plane messages between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE. 3GPP AS Control Plane and User Plane messages that are transported via the Open Fronthaul U-Plane (LLS-UP) are confidentiality and integrity protected by Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [32][55]. The PDCP [32] security controls remain in place when the message traverses the Open Fronthaul U-Plane.
However, there are certain U-Plane messages containing IQ samples, including PRACH, PUCCH, SSB, as well as O-RAN Application and eCPRI headers, that are transported over Open Fronthaul as encapsulated Ethernet packets without integrity and confidentiality protection.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OFUP-1: The OFH interface should support integrity and anti-replay protection to ensure that U-Plane data remains unaltered during transmission.
REQ-SEC-OFUP-2: The OFH interface should support mutual authentication to ensure that both transmitting and receiving OFH network elements are authenticated before any U-Plane data is exchanged.
REQ-SEC-OFUP-3: The OFH interface should support authorization to ensure that only authorized OFH network elements can exchange U-Plane data.
REQ-SEC-OFUP-4: The OFH interface may support confidentiality to protect U-Plane data from unauthorized access during transmission.
Security Controls
Confidentiality protection for U-Plane data using MACsec
Clause 5.2.5.6 of this document provides the solutions for protecting Open Fronthaul messages and defines the security controls for encrypting U-Plane data on the Open Fronthaul network segment using MACsec [79]. The security controls in clause 5.2.5.6 fulfil the requirements REQ-SEC-OFUP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFUP-4.
SEC-CTL-OFUP-1: Void

The security requirements and controls in clause 5.2.5.5 fulfil the requirements REQ-SEC-OFUP-2 and REQ-SEC-OFUP-3.
S-plane
Introduction
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks within a PTP network. Within a PTP domain [27], the grandmaster clock is the source of time to which all other PTP clocks in the domain are synchronized.
The IEEE 1588 standard [27] specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the best clock from PTP Network and Local PTP Clock. The BMCA runs on PTP instances in the network continuously and is adjusting to changes in that network. PTP ANNOUNCE messages are used to build a timing distribution hierarchy with grandmaster at the top. There can be many grandmasters in PTP Network, but PTP Domain can have only one. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for providing timing to the PTP slave nodes.
Following the selection of the new grandmaster, the grandmaster begins transmitting the current time within the SYNC message and FOLLOW_UP messages if applicable. This allows the other clocks to synchronize their time to the grandmaster.
S-Plane attacks include an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization. An attacker within the PTP network could impersonate the master clock’s grandmaster’s Identity value and propose himself as a grandmaster candidate by sending fake ANNOUNCE messages declaring him to be the best clock in the network. The malicious GM would provide intentionally inaccurate timing information that results in degradation in the accuracy of time synchronisation and may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time synchronisation, potentially bringing down the cell.
Details are covered in [i.14], clause 7.4.1.2.
The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:
O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.
O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RU’s at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).
Requirements
REQ-SEC-OFSP-1: The S-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.
NOTE 1:	This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane where authenticated and authorized PTP nodes communicate over the Open Fronthaul network.
NOTE 2:	There is no specific requirement for authentication and authorization mechanism of S-plane PTP messages.
REQ-SEC-OFSP-2: The S-Plane should provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.
REQ-SEC-OFSP-3: For the O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model the S-Plane should protect against MITM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [28].
REQ-SEC-OFSP-4: The O-DU shall be able to detect and defend against application level attacks across the S-Plane interface, due to misbehaviour or malicious intent.
REQ-SEC-OFSP-5: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism to authenticate the sender of the PTP ANNOUNCE messages.
REQ-SEC-OFSP-6: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism for integrity protection of the PTP ANNOUNCE messages.
REQ-SEC-OFSP-7: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism for replay protection of the PTP ANNOUNCE messages.
REQ-SEC-OFSP-8: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism for confidentiality protection of the PTP messages.

Synchronization Architecture Redundancy
This clause addresses requirement REQ-SEC-OFSP-3 by providing an architectural recommendation to S-plane security based on redundancy in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into to the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-1: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support simultaneous Grandmasters.
SEC-CTL-OFSP-2: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.
O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [30], clause 8.2.3 Timing/Synchronization Redundancy & Resiliency provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.
Authentication and Authorization of PTP nodes
This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFSP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFSP-2 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.
Clause 5.2.5.5 provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

Open Fronthaul Point-to-Point LAN Segment
Introduction
The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. These are also known as point-to-point LAN segments [12]. Each end of the Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segment comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, as described in [13] and [14].
EXAMPLE:	Physical O-RAN network elements includes O-DU, O-RU.
An Open Fronthaul network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Xhaul Transport Network Elements that share a point-to-point LAN segment with Open Fronthaul network elements are also Open Fronthaul network elements. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, TNE and PRTC-T/GM, see [13],[14],[15] and [26].

REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-2: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to detect and report when an authorized point-to-point LAN segment is made or broken.
REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-3: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to block access to unused Ethernet ports in an Open Fronthaul network element.
Open Fronthaul implementations may support IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] to satisfy the requirements listed above. Implementations that support optional 802.1X shall provide the security controls as specified in clause 5.2.5.5.3.
Security Controls
Solution #1: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1X Port based Network Access Control
IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] is optional to support.
IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] Port-based Network Access Control provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network. Port-based network access control in the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprises supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] and as further described in this clause. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X [12] are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification and are determined by vendor implementation in agreement with operator-specific requirements.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-1: Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.
Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-2: Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] supplicant functionality for each port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.
Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network
In IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] a supplicant mutually authenticates with an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-3: Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-4: An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based network access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-5: Port-based network access control between a supplicant and authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall use EAP-TLS authentication as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
O-DU as an Authenticator
Configuration LLS-C1 [13] and Cascade Mode in the Shared Cell Concept [12] are cases where an O-DU and O-RU are Open Fronthaul network elements in a point-to-point LAN segment.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-6: In the case of Configuration LLS-C1, the O-DU shall support the authenticator functionality as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].
Authenticator interface to an Authentication Server in the Open Fronthaul Network
IEEE 802.1X describes an EAP-TLS exchange which includes an interface between an authenticator and authentication server [12].
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-7: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server shall support IETF RADIUS standards, IETF RFC 2865 [22], IETF RFC 2866 [23], IETF RFC 3579 [24], and successor standards.

NOTE :	Mechanisms to secure the interface between the authenticator and authentication server are out of scope of the O-RAN Alliance.
Authentication and authorization procedure for 802.1X Port based Network Access Control
General requirements
Only those Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant that have mutually authenticated with an authenticator are authorized to participate in the Open Fronthaul network. If an authenticator port is to be activated in the Open Fronthaul, then the authenticator places the port into an unauthorized state that allows EAP over LAN (EAPOL) packets for EAP authentication and blocks all other traffic. If the mutual authentication has been successful and the operator authorizes operation for the network element port, then the port is switched to the authorized state whereby non-EAPOL packets can be sent and received.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-9: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator shall place each of its unauthorized ports into a state that allows EAPOL traffic and block all other Ethernet traffic.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-10: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator should be able to implement authorization policies that apply to its authorized ports.
NOTE:	Authorization policies may include tagging authorized traffic with a particular VLAN-ID as it egresses the Open Fronthaul network element and/or enforcing access control policies that restrict the type of traffic able to be forwarded by the Open Fronthaul network element.
Manufacturer Install Certificates
This clause applies to the Extensible Authentication Protocol as defined in IEEE 802.1X [12].  where such an approach is used. A supplicant implements an EAP method according to its supported credentials. Prior to a supplicant enrolling in an operator’s PKI, a manufacturer installed certificate shall be used together with an EAP-TLS dialogue to enable certificate-based mutual authentication to be performed between an authenticator and a supplicant.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-11: The O-RU shall have installed a Manufacturer Installed X.509 Certificate.
Security Procedure
The following procedure describes the authentication and authorization, based on IEEE 802.1X Port based Network Access Control, of point-to-point LAN segments between a supplicant and another Open Fronthaul network element acting as an authenticator.
SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-12: The normal operation procedure defined in IEEE 802.1X [12] shown in Figure 5.2.5.5.3-1 shall be performed to authenticate and authorize an O-RU within an Open Fronthaul network.

MACsec defined in the standard IEEE 802.1AE -2018[79] is a Layer 2 protocol that provides data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and authenticity of data origin including replay protection for all types of traffic on Ethernet links.
MACsec can be configured in an End-to-End mode or Hop-by-Hop mode. Hop-by-Hop mode requires the intermediate nodes to support MACsec. End-to-End mode does not require the intermediate nodes to support MACsec. 
MACsec configuration can be applied per VLAN or at the base interface level.
The following clause describes the supported encryption modes for establishing MACsec.
MACsec using EDE-CC
WAN mode MACsec
LAN mode MACsec
The Open Fronthaul network element can use one of the encryption modes based on the specific Open Fronthaul traffic that requires protection.
MACsec using EDE-CC
Introduction
In this mode, MACsec uses EDE-CC, controlled port, uncontrolled port as functional blocks from IEEE 802.1AE-2018 [79]. This solution applies to scenarios where MACsec is applied based on VLAN tags and configured at the VLAN interface.
This mode allows 802.1Q VLAN tags to be encrypted inside the MACsec header and also sent in clear text, outside the MACsec header. The inner VLAN tag is protected by MACsec while the outer VLAN tag is used for VLAN based switching in a network where some transport network elements may not be MACsec capable. This solution enables MACsec to be configured in an end-to end tunnel mode such that the intermediate nodes may be MACsec-unaware.
To prevent intermediary nodes from consuming EAPoL packets, it is recommended to configure the group destination address as specified in IEEE 802.1AE-2018 [79], Table 15.1.
Figure 5.2.5.6.2-1 depicts the scenario where the O-RU and O-DU are connected via a switched fronthaul network and MACsec is enabled at O-DU and O-RU in an End-to-End tunnel mode. The TNE and intermediary switches may or may not support MACsec capabilities.
Figure 5.2.5.6.2-1: End-to-End MACsec solution for fronthaul security protection
The O-DU functional block transmits the Open Fronthaul message that needs encryption to the controlled port, which passes through an EDE functional block. This EDE block secures the Open Fronthaul message using MACsec. The messages are filtered based on their EtherType. The EDE-CC, a variant of EDE, adds a cleartext VLAN header before the MACsec header, which includes VLAN and VLAN PCP bits, that are used for VLAN-based switching and identifying QoS profiles in the MACsec-unaware Fronthaul TNE connected to the O-DU. At the receiving endpoint, the O-RU validates the encrypted traffic received at the EDE using MACsec. Upon successful validation, it forwards the traffic via the controlled port to the O-RU functional block. Communication from the O-RU to the O-DU follows a similar process.
The O-DU functional block transmits the S-Plane messages that do not require encryption to the uncontrolled port. The S-Plane message has a specific PTP EtherType for the G.8275.1 profile. The demultiplexing operation selectively filters out PTP traffic based on its EtherType and forwards it to the uncontrolled port. As a result, PTP messages exit the hardware port unprotected by MACsec. When receiving, the O-RU maps PTP messages to the uncontrolled port based on the EtherType. Through the uncontrolled port, PTP messages are directed to the 1588 layer in the O-RU functional block.
Depending on the chosen network topology, the MACsec tunnel endpoint can be a TNE, and the functionalities of controlled, uncontrolled ports, and EDE can apply to it. Communication between the selected MACsec tunnel endpoints would occur in a similar manner.
Security Controls
This clause specifies the security controls for configuring MACsec using EDE-CC. The Open Fronthaul network elements include the O-DU, O-RU and TNE.
SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-1: The Open Fronthaul network elements may support the functional blocks of controlled port, uncontrolled port, and Ethernet Data Encryption (EDE), as defined in the standard IEEE 802.1AE -2018 [79] clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 15.6.
SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-2: The Open Fronthaul network elements may demultiplex PTP messages identified by EtherType for G.8275.1 to the uncontrolled port that remain unprotected by MACsec.
SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-3: The Open Fronthaul network elements may forward the data that need to be encrypted to the controlled port . The controlled port then sends the data to the EDE functional block that is secured by MACsec.
SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-4: The Open Fronthaul network elements may support the EDE-CC functionality that allows utilization of the frame’s VLAN tag for service selection and conveyance of Priority Code Point (PCP) and drop-eligible (DEI) information.
SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-5: If an Open Fronthaul network element supports the EDE-CC functionality, it shall support the cipher suites, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.9.
WAN mode MACsec
Introduction
This mode allows the 802.1Q VLAN tag to be unencrypted and sent in clear text, outside the MACsec header. This solution applies to scenarios where MACsec is applied based on VLAN tag and configured at the VLAN interface. This solution enables the intermediatory switches that are MACsec-unaware to switch the packets based on the VLAN tag.
To prevent MACsec capable intermediary nodes from consuming EAPoL packets, it is recommended to configure the group destination address to allow the intermediatory nodes to tunnel the packets like data packets.
Security Controls
This clause specifies the security controls for configuring MACsec using VLAN in the clear. The Open Fronthaul network elements include the O-DU, O-RU and TNE.
SEC-CTL-OFHWMM-1: The Open Fronthaul network elements may support a MACsec solution allowing the VLAN header to travel in the clear.
SEC-CTL-OFHWMM-2: If an Open Fronthaul network element supports a MACsec solution allowing the VLAN header to travel in the clear, it shall support the cipher suites, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.9.
LAN mode MACsec
Introduction
This solution requires that the entire Ethernet frame after the MAC address should be encrypted. The Secure TAG of MACsec encompasses both VLAN-tagged and non-VLAN-tagged frames, securing all traffic that travels through the interface of an Open Fronthaul network element.
It may be possible to configure additional policies to bypass MACsec protection based on EtherType, VLAN ID, and destination address. When enabled, this capability allows certain types of Open Fronthaul traffic, such as S-Plane, to remain unencrypted and bypass MACsec protection.
Security Controls
This clause specifies the security controls for configuring MACsec to protect the entire Ethernet frame after the MAC address. The Open Fronthaul network elements include the O-DU, O-RU and TNE.

Requirements
REQ-SEC-SLM-FMT-1: Security logs shall be formatted in a consistent, standard, and machine-readable format that maintains backward compatibility with previous log format versions.
Log Fields
Introduction
To enable effective security analytics, it is important to include additional details in the security logs of the security event. These details help to identify adversarial operations within the O-RAN environment. A typical security log entry consists of two main parts: the log fields and the log message. The log fields provide metadata about the security log entry, while the log message contains the actual content and details of the security event being logged. The requirements specified in this clause pertain to the log fields.
Requirements
REQ-SEC-SLM-FLD-1: Security logs shall include the date and time of the security event for each log entry, using a consistent and standardized format that logs time to at least the second.
REQ-SEC-SLM-FLD-2: Security logs shall record the location of the security event for each log entry.

Security Events to be Logged
Introduction
During O-RAN operations, components generate many events. Some of these events have security utility and are thus termed security events. Logging these security events is critical to maintaining a secure O-RAN environment. For convenience, security event log requirements are organized by high-level categories. These categories are mapped against the following O-RAN architectural elements: SMO, O-RAN Network Functions (NF), and O-Cloud (see Table 5.3.8.11.1-1).
The SMO has security events related to management and orchestration.
O-RAN Network Functions have application security events.
O-Cloud has both network security events and system security events related to operating systems, hypervisors, and container runtimes.
The following security event types occur in all O-RAN components (SMO, O-RAN NF, and O-Cloud): account and identity event, data access events, and general security events.

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Introduction
An Application Programming Interface (API) is implemented by a software program to be able to interact with other software programs as defined in [i.16]. An API is a set of libraries or specifications which allows interaction with an external artefact or agent from a third party. The APIs which comply with the REST constraints are said to be RESTful and refer to the description of a communication interface that allows interacting with a system based on the REST architecture style.
The specification of RESTful APIs plays its role at given an interface between two components in the system architecture, a RESTful API provides the implementation details for the communication between these two entities, which are then identified as the API Producer (or Server) and the API Consumer (or Client).
The security requirements in this clause provide protections against the vulnerabilities and security risks identified in the OWASP API Security Project Top 10 2023 vulnerabilities and security risks of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) [i.9]. APIs as referred to in this clause are transactional APIs based on REST or gRPC. The terms client, resource owner, and resource server are defined in IETF RFC 6749 [34].

SBOM Guidelines for O-RAN
SBOM Overview
This clause provides guidance for generation, delivery, and use of a software bill of materials (SBOM).
SBOM is a fundamental component of a mature Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SBOM is an industry best practice part of secure software development that enhances the understanding of the upstream software supply chain so that vulnerability notifications and updates can be properly and safely handled across the installed customer base.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) define SBOM as “a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.” The DoC, in coordination with NTIA, published a report “The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)” [17] that provides guidance on the data fields, automation, and processes to be used by suppliers and customers. The SBOM documents proprietary and third-party software, including commercial and free and open-source software (FOSS), used in software products. The SBOM is maintained and used by the software supplier and stored and viewed by the network operator.

Guidance on Security Requirements & Controls
C.1 O-Cloud
Controls given in this clause are designed as a guidance and non-normative. The implementation of those non-normative controls depends on the security policies within the O-Cloud Service Provider, O-RAN Application Provider and Service Provider.
C.1.1 Secure protection of cryptographic keys and sensitive data
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-1
The following potential implementation options for encrypting cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the O-Cloud platform could be used. The appropriate option to be used depends on the sensitivity of the data to be protected and needs to be assessed/determined by the Service provider.
Software based:
Software-based KMS vaults supporting management of keys, including creation, rotation, and revocation, as well as encrypting and decrypting sensitive data with managed keys [51].
Use a vTPM: A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) is a software-based representation of a physical Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip to provide secure storage of credentials or keys [54]. A vTPM acts as any other virtual device. It performs the same functions as a TPM, but it performs cryptographic coprocessor capabilities in software. It should comply with the TPM 2.0 specification [53].
Hardware based
Hardware-based key vaults: The use of Key Management Service (KMS) based on an HSM [i.5], [i.6], [52]. The data is encrypted using a data encryption key (DEK); a new DEK is generated for each encryption. The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) that is stored and managed in the HSM of the KMS provider.
A hardware TPM [i.8], [53]. For data encryption, an encryption key is stored on disk but encrypted with the TPM master key (the storage root key (SRK)). This encryption key can only be used after it was decrypted by an authenticated TPM. The actual data encryption/decryption is then done by the main CPU, only decryption/encryption of the encryption key is done inside the TPM.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-2
Overwriting with zero (e.g., /dev/zero) or simple patterns.
Overwriting with random data using:
True random data source (e.g., /dev/random). This solution takes too long to wait for the entropy generation.
Pseudorandom data source (e.g., /dev/urandom) can be used as a reasonable source of pseudorandom data.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-3
Each data centre adheres to a strict disposal policy and uses the techniques described to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 "Guidelines for Media Sanitization” [75] and DoD 5220.22-M “National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual" [50].
Potential solutions for REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SS-5
Automatic memory scrubbing on boot:
Implement a process that automatically clears all volatile memory as early as possible during the boot sequence. This can be achieved through BIOS settings or early-stage boot loader scripts that overwrite memory with zeros or random data to ensure no residual data is left accessible.
Watchdog timers:
Use timers that watch for unexpected shutdowns or power losses. If something goes wrong, these timers help make sure memory is cleaned properly before the system starts up again.
Work with power backup systems:
For systems with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), integrate the memory scrubbing mechanism with UPS software to initiate secure shutdown procedures that include clearing volatile memory when the UPS detects a power outage and is about to run out of battery.
C.1.2 Chain of Trust
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1
There are many ways to measure platform integrity. In many cases, a hardware security module is used to store measurement data such as an HSM and TPM. Various platform integrity technologies build their own CoTs [i.7] and listed here below:
UEFI Secure Boot (SB)
Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)
Intel Boot Guard
Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR)
Intel Technology Example Summary
AMD Platform Secure Boot (AMD PSB)
Arm TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for Armv8-A
Arm Secure Boot and the Chain of Trust (CoT)
Cisco Platform Roots of Trust
IBM Chain of Trust (CoT)
For more details, see [i.7], clause 3.2.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2
A vTPM can be considered a software-based implementation of a root of trust. It emulates the behavior and functionalities of a physical TPM through software mechanisms and cryptographic libraries [53] and [54]. A vTPM operates within a virtual machine or as a software module within an operating system, leveraging the underlying hardware and security features provided by the host system. It can perform key generation, storage, and cryptographic operations similar to a physical TPM. However, since it is implemented in software, its security relies on the host system's security measures and may be more vulnerable to compromise if the host system is compromised. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the overall security of the O-Cloud where the vTPM is deployed and to consider additional security measures to protect the software root of trust.
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-3
Please refer to the following technology examples in [i.7], clause 6.1 for more information:
Intel Security Libraries for the Data Center (ISecL-DC)
Remote AS - Project Veraison (VERificAtIon of atteStatiON)
IBM Platform Attestation Tooling
Relevant information on the Attestation Server is provided in [i.7], clause 6.1 and [i.15], clause 6.6.
The following figure C.1.2-1 shows an example of remote AS:
Figure C.1.2-1: Example of Remote AS
The AS from the hardware layer to the O-RAN Application includes the following steps (see figure C.1.2-1):
Attestation of the O-Cloud platform
RoT measures and verifies hardware resources (server platform) including firmware/BIOS. It then launches the hardware resources.
The server act as the attester of the OS/virtualization layer. It measures, verifies, and launches the OS/virtualization layer.
The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by the management platform (e.g. Kubernetes) acting as the trust agent.
Attestation of Application
The attestation process is initiated by the management platform requesting to instantiate a new Application:
The virtualization layer verifies the virtual instance.
Virtualized RoT (vRoT) measures the Application. The vRoT is a virtual instance associated to the hardware protected RoT. The virtualization layer provides this virtual resource to the virtual instance.
Corresponding measurements are reported to the trust agent. The trust agent exposes the attestation results to authorized attestation server (could be within the SMO) so that it verifies collected measurements against trust policies already defined by administrators.
C.1.3 Recommended Security Policies
C.2 Common Application Lifecycle Management
C.2.1 Software Package Protection
Potential controls on REQ-SEC-ALM-PKG-1 and REQ-SEC-ALM-PKG-4
Application packages need to be frequently tested throughout the lifecycle of the Application:
Table C.2.1-1: Application Testing throughout the lifecycle
Tools used for static code and dynamic security analysis, analysis of code being released, and penetration test results must be shared with the Service Provider.
C.3 Certificate Management Framework
C.3.1 Certificate enrolment for NF Deployment
Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-CMF-VNF_CNF-1
Table C.3.1-1 and Figure C.3.1-2 illustrate the steps performed to configure a certificate for NF Deployment. The certificate is used for secured communication between SMO and Cloudified NF. The below procedure is specified as an addition to the NF Deployment instantiation use case on O-Cloud as specified in clause 3.2.1 of ORAN TS Cloudification and Orchestration Use Cases and Requirements for O-RAN Virtualized RAN [82].
