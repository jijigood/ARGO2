4	General
4.1	Introduction
Clause 4 specifies the principles and conventions commonly applied to Near-RT RIC API design with the Network API approach as described in clause 7.1.2 of [2].
4.2	General Principles
For each Near-RT RIC API, the following principles should be followed:
-	A default solution that includes network protocol and message encoding should be defined to ensure interoperability. The default solution requires mandatory support by all Near-RT RIC platforms and xApps. The optional protocols available for a given APIs are discoverable by xApps.
-	The IEs in the Near-RT RIC API which refer to different specifications shall be encoded as defined in the referred specification.
The common data types applicable to several API categories should be collected in clause 10.
In addition, the following design principles shall apply:
Parallel transactions, i.e., multiple ongoing Near-RT RIC API procedures of the same types related to the same xApp, and platform functionality are supported.
4.3	Version Control
An API version shall consist of at least 3 fields, following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern according to the Semantic Versioning Specification [i.1] unless specified otherwise.
EXAMPLE:	"1.0.0".
The basic rules as reproduced from [i.1] shall apply for incrementing the versions:
-	MAJOR version is incremented if backward incompatible change is made.
-	MINOR version is incremented if functional change is made in a backward compatible way.
-	PATCH version is incremented if correction is made in a backward compatible way.
5	A1-related API
5.1	Overview
5.1.1	Protocol Stack
In this version of specification, the default protocol stack for the A1 related APIs is shown on Figure 5.1.1-1.
Note: the network layer for security protection is FFS.
Figure 5.1.1-1: Protocol stack for A1 related APIs
The A1 related APIs use gRPC [5] with Protocol Buffers [4] as the application layer serialization protocol.
5.1.2	List of A1 related APIs, procedures and messages
The A1 related API procedures introduced in clause 9.2 of [2] are categorized under the A1 related APIs. These APIs include:
A1 Policy API:  enabling A1 policy related operations for the xApps.
A1 Enrichment Information (A1-EI) API: enabling A1-EI related operations for the xApps.
These APIs are summarized in Table 5.1.2-1.
Table 5.1.2-1: List of A1 related APIs
The table 5.1.2-2 lists the API procedures for each A1 related API.
Table 5.1.2-2: List of A1 related API procedures

Figure 5.2.1.2-1 : A1 Policy Setup procedure, successful operation
The Near-RT RIC Platform initiates the procedure by sending A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message to xApp.
The A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information required by the xApp to setup one A1 policy including A1 Policy Type ID IE, A1 Policy ID IE, and A1 Policy Object IE.
Upon reception of the A1 POLICY SETUP REQUEST message, the xApp shall transform the received A1 policy into appropriate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements, and shall trigger Near-RT RIC Platform to accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements.
If Near-RT RIC Platform is able to accommodate E2 / A1-EI operation(s) requirements, xApp replies A1 POLICY SETUP RESULT message with A1 Policy Setup Result IE set to success to Near-RT RIC Platform. And xApp should store the received A1 Policy Type ID IE, A1 Policy ID IE, A1 Policy Object IE as basic elements of A1 policy profile, and label the status of corresponding A1 policy as “enforced”.

Figure 6.2.1.1.2-1: E2 Subscription procedure, successful operation
The xApp initiates the procedure by sending an E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains a unique Procedure Transaction ID IE assigned by the initiating xApp, the Global E2 Node ID IE, the RAN Function ID IE, and the E2 Subscription Details IE including one or more requested E2 actions and optionally the E2 Subscription Timer IE. The message may include the E2 Indication Destination IE which specifies the xApp's endpoint to receive E2 indications (see clause 6.2.2.1), and the E2 Subscription Delete Notification Destination IE which specifies the xApp's endpoint to receive query/notification from the Near-RT RIC platform for E2 subscription deletion (see clause 6.2.1.3/6.2.1.4).
Note: When execution order of multiple actions is not concerned, it is recommended that an E2 Subscription procedure contains a single action, to allow efficient reuse of E2 subscriptions.
At reception of the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC platform shall:
-	Search existing E2 subscription(s) for matched Global E2 Node ID IE, RAN Function ID IE and matched contents in E2 Subscription Details IE. If a matched E2 subscription exists, add the initiating xApp as a new subscriber of the E2 subscription.
-	Initiate appropriate E2AP procedure(s) to establish RIC subscription with the target E2 Node, if existing E2 subscriptions are insufficient to fulfill the request.
The Near-RT-RIC platform may use the value in the E2 Subscription Timer IE, if present, as a one-time value of the E2AP timer TRICEVENTcreate in clause 9.5 of [3], which is valid only for this transaction.
If the subscription request is successfully fulfilled, the Near-RT RIC platform shall send an E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message back to the xApp. Similar to [3], a successfully fulfilled request shall be sent if the E2 event trigger and at least one requested E2 action are admitted.
In the E2 SUBSCRIPTION (Success) message, Near-RT RIC platform shall include the associated Procedure Transaction ID IE, Global E2 Node ID IE, RAN Function ID IE and an E2 Request ID IE assigned by the Near-RT RIC platform. The message shall also indicate the admitted E2 action(s) in the Actions Admitted List IE, each with the associated E2 Action ID IE assigned by the Near-RT RIC platform.  The same E2 Request ID IE and E2 Action ID IE shall be present in any subsequent E2 INDICATION message(s). The message shall indicate, if exist, the E2 action(s) not admitted in the Actions Not Admitted List IE with appropriate cause(s).

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: xApp Registration procedure, successful operation
The xApp initiates the procedure by sending an xApp Registration (Request) message to the Near-RT-RIC platform. The message contains a unique Procedure Transaction ID IE assigned by the initiating xApp, the optional xApp Description IE, and the Required APIs and Data Types IE that specifies the APIs and data types needed for normal operation of the xApp.
At reception of the xApp Registration (Request) message, the Near-RT-RIC platform shall:
-	 Check xApp’s compatibility with the Near-RT RIC platform, using information in the Required APIs and Data Types IE.
-	Assign an xApp ID and create the profile for the xApp.
If the registration request is successfully fulfilled, the Near-RT RIC platform shall send an xApp Registration (Success) message back to the xApp.
In the xApp Registration (Success) message, the Near-RT RIC platform shall include the associated Procedure Transaction ID IE and the xApp ID IE.

9.3.5.1	Solution 1: gRPC with Protocol Buffers
The message transfer syntax for Solution 1 is serialized Protocol Buffers [4].
10	Common definitions across APIs
10.1	Information element definitions
10.1.1	PTI
The Procedure Transaction Identity (PTI) IE allows identifing a procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same RICAPI peer. The PTI value is assigned to the initiating message by the procedure initiator, and subsequent messages shall include the same PTI value as in the initiating message, if any. PTI is released when the procedure is completed.
10.1.2	xApp ID
The xApp ID IE uniquely identifies an xApp.
10.1.3	API Name
The API Name IE indicates the Name of each Near-RT RIC API.
The table 10.1.3-1 lists the API Names.

10.1.4	API Version
The API Version IE indicates the Version of each Near-RT RIC API.
10.1.5	A1 Policy Type ID
The A1 Policy Type ID IE identifies the type of one A1 policy.
10.1.6	Global E2 Node ID
Defined in 9.2.6 of [3].
10.1.7	RAN Function ID
Defined in 9.2.8 of [3].
10.1.8	SCTP API PDU
The SCTP API PDU IE serves as the outer layer encapsulation for the payload when SCTP is used as the transport protocol.
