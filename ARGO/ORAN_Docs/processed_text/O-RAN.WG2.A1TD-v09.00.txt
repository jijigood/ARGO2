4	A1 Application data model
4.1	Introduction
The present document together with A1AP [3] contains a REST method realization of the A1 interface architecture and the A1 procedures identified in A1GAP [2].
A1AP [3] contains the service description, service operations, resource indicators and the API definition (including the OpenAPI document) for the A1 services. The present document contains the data model and the definitions of the objects transported in the procedures defined for the A1 services.
The data types defined in the present document have a lifecycle that is independent from the A1 services defined in A1AP [3]. The A1 data models are based on the application data model used for API definitions in 3GPP TS 29.501 [4] and data types specified in 3GPP TS 29.571 [5]. It is based on structured data types and objects as specified in IETF RFC 8259 [6] and JSON Schema [7].
4.2	Compatibility of A1 type definitions
The version number of the present document indicates that there may be implications for the compatibility between implementations of policy types and/or EI types defined in different versions of the present document.
The first two-digit value of the present document is incremented when
at least one policy type and/or one EI type has been added or removed; and/or
at least one policy type and/or one EI type has been updated in a non-backward compatible way.
The second two-digit value of the present document is incremented when at least one policy type and/or one EI type has been updated in a backward compatible way.
Policy type compatibility is described in clause 7.1.1 and EI type compatibility is described in clause 9.1.1.
The compatibility of A1 implementations in Non/Near-RT RICs depends on the policy types and/or EI types that are implemented. The present document handles the compatibility for data types used by the A1 services while A1AP [3] handles the A1 service compatibility aspects.
5	Generic aspects and common data types
5.1	Encoding of attributes in A1 data types
The encoding of 3GPP attributes into JSON is based on their original definitions, and their value ranges, rather than on encodings used in other protocols or solutions sets. The definitions are referred to in the data type definitions (see clauses 6.2 and 6.3) and the corresponding encodings are seen in the type definitions (see clause 7.1.2.1 and 7.2).
5.2	Current type definitions
The present document defines the policy types, EI types and common data types listed in table 5.2-1.
Table 5.2-1:	Type defintions in the present document
6	A1-P data model
6.1	Introduction
This clause specifies the application data model and data types supported by the A1-P API specified in A1AP [3]). The data model is based on policy statements that include attributes and are combined with a scope identifier into policy objects.
Simple data types and enumerations can be referenced from structured data type and policy types. Clause 6.3 defines attributes to be used for scope information and attributes that are not defined as part of the statements (structured data types as defined in coming clauses).
For policy objectives, policy statements for the following characteristics are defined:
QoS targets;
QoE targets;
UE level targets;
Slice SLA targets;
Load balancing targets; and
Energy saving targets.
For policy resources, policy statements for the following characteristics are defined:
Traffic steering optimization;
Slice SLA assurance;
Load balancing; and
Energy saving.
Clause 6.4 contains the formal representation definitions of the policy representation object types defined in the A1-P service description in A1AP [3].

Table 6.3.3.3-1: Definition of statement type QoeObjectives
Application server will measure the QoE related attributes (e.g. MOS, initial buffering, reBuffFreq, stallRatio) for a specific service based on application info. However, it’s too late for the network to optimize the radio resource when the application server finds the QoE is too bad. The Near-RT RIC could predict the QoE related attributes based on the network side info (e.g. QoS parameters, radio conditions, Packet measure report etc.) e.g. by performing model inference for a specific ML model received from the Non-RT RIC. The predicted value is approximately the QoE related attribute which will be measured at application server later, but it’s estimated at the Near-RT RIC in real time. So, the Near-RT RIC could decide to optimize the radio resource based on the predicted value and the QoE target contained in the A1 policy.

When the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER or AVOID, the cellIdList contains cells in descending order of importance for how they should be preferred or avoided, e.g. the first entry is most preferred or most avoided.  When the preference value is set to SHALL or FORBID, the cellIdList contains cells that are of equal importance.
When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the value of the preference attribute is set to SHALL, then only a cell in the cellIdList is to be used as primary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER, then a cell in the cellIdList may be used as primary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the preference value is set to AVOID or FORBID, then no cell in the cellIdList is to be used as primary cell.
When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the value of the preference attribute is set to SHALL, then only one or more cells in the cellIdList are to be used as secondary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER, then one or more cells in the cellIdList may be used as secondary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the preference value is set to AVOID or FORBID, then no cell in the cellIdList is to be used as secondary cell.
When the primary attribute is not included, the statement shall be handled in the same way as when the primary attribute is set to false.

When the value of the coveragePreference attribute is set to AVOID, the coverageCells contains cells that should be avoided from having any coverage impact while performing the network energy savings. The coverageCells contains cells in descending order of importance for how they should be avoided, e.g. the first entry is most avoided from having any coverage impact while performing the network energy savings.
If prbTotalDl is present in EsResource, then a cell may perform network energy saving methods only when its DL total PRB usage is not higher than the specified prbTotalDl value. If prbTotalUl is present in EsResource, then a cell may perform network energy saving methods only when its UL total PRB usage is not higher than the specified prbTotalUl value. If both prbTotalDl and prbTotalUl are present in EsResource, then a cell may perform network energy saving methods only when its DL total PRB usage is not higher than the specified prbTotalDl value and its UL total PRB usage is not higher than the specified prbTotalUl value. The conditions should be checked when the corresponding performance measurements are available at the Near-RT RIC.
6.4	Policy representations objects
6.4.1	Policy object
6.4.1.1	General
A PolicyObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and it always contains one set of:
one ScopeIdentifier; and
one or more Statements.
The PolicyObject can contain objective and/or resource statements as defined in table 6.4.1.1-1.
Table 6.4.1.1-1: General definition of PolicyObject
This definition is general and indicates how to formally construct a PolicyObject. The policy types in clause 7 defines PolicyObjects for usage in the A1 procedures defined in A1AP [3].
6.4.1.2	Allowed combinations
A Statement can be applied together with a ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers attributes. Not all combinations are relevant and different combinations are relevant for different policy types (see clause 7).
6.4.2	Policy status object
A PolicyStatusObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and contains:
one enforceStatus attribute; and conditionally
one enforceReason attribute.
The PolicyStatusObject contains status related attributes as defined in table 6.4.2.1-1:
Table 6.4.2.1: General definition of PolicyStatusObject
6.4.3	Policy type object
A PolicyTypeObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and contains:
one JSON schema for PolicyObject; and optionally
one JSON schema for PolicyStatusObject.
The type PolicyTypeObject is defined in table 6.4.3-1.
Table 6.4.3-1: General definition of PolicyTypeObject
The JSON schema for a PolicyObject is used by the A1-P Producer to validate a PolicyObject during Create policy and Update policy procedures. The JSON schema for a PolicyStatusObject is used by the A1-P Consumer to validate a PolicyStatusObject during Query policy status and Feedback policy procedures. The PolicyTypeObject can be retrieved using the Query policy type procedure.

7.1		Introduction
7.1.1	Identification and compatibility of policy types
A policy type is identified by a PolicyTypeId as defined in A1AP [3]. The PolicyTypeId is a string that consists of two parts: a typename and a version.
When updating a policy type, the version in the PolicyTypeId is updated according to SemVer [19] to reflect its compatibility with other policy types that has the same typename.
Two policy types are considered as different if the PolicyTypeId is different, i.e. even if the typename is the same and the version only differs in the patch version digit.
Two policy types are compatible in case the typename is the same and the major version digit in the version is the same. In general, two policy types X and Y are compatible when all objects that can be created based on policy type X can be validated by the schemas for policy type Y and all objects that can be created based on policy type Y can be validated by the schemas for policy type X.
7.1.2	Common definitions
7.1.2.1	Scope and resource identifiers
An A1 policy type always contains a ScopeIdentifier with data types defined in clause 6.3.1. It may also contain attributes for a resource statement that includes identifiers defined in clauses 6.3.2 and 6.3.4. To enable multiple policy types to be created based on the same identifiers, the policy schemas can link to the same JSON subschema for common data types.
Each policy type definition links to a specific version of the common data types schema and the compatibility relations are described in Annex C. The policy types defined in the present document link to the version of the common data types schema defined in the present document.
When updating the common data types schema, the version is updated according to SemVer [19]. The $id keyword in the common data types schema contains the version as part of the URI.

7.1.3	Schema identification
7.1.3.1	General
The policy schemas defined in clause 7.2 (e.g. policy schema for QoS target in clause 7.2.1.3.1) are base schemas that embed a subschema with common data types definitions. The base schemas can be used for creating or validating A1 policies after embedding the content of the linked common data types schema. A schema resulting from embedding the content of a linked subschema into a base schema is referred to as a compound schema document, see JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 [7]. It is the compound policy schemas that are identified by the policy type identifier and included in the PolicyTypeObject specified in clause 6.4.3.
The base schema and the linked subschema together represent the same JSON schema as the compound schema created by embedding the linked subschema into the base schema at the place where it is linked. Hence, the versions of a compound policy schema and its base policy schema are the same, and is indicated in the policy type identifier. The policy type identifier is part of the $id keyword included in the policy schema. The $id keyword of the embedded subschemas are included in the subschema.
7.1.3.2	Schema URI structure
The base URI for A1 policy types and embedded schemas is:
{uriRoot}/a1td
where uriRoot follows an absolute URI syntax, but excludes the "query" component. The URI root contains the "scheme" component and may contain an "authority" component and may also contain a prefix subcomponent.
The $id keyword for the policy schemas are constructed from the base URI and the policy type identifier:
{uriRoot}/a1td/<policyTypeId>
The $id keyword for the subschema with common data types is constructed from the base URI, the name "common", and the version (x.y.z):
{uriRoot}/a1td/common_<x.y.z>.
In the JSON schemas defined in the present document, the default uriRoot is:

A lbObjectives statement can be applied together with ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers. Not all combinations are relevant. Table 7.2.8.2.2-1 indicates the combinations that are allowed.
ScopeIdentifier is used to designate a cell from which load needs to be transferred to other cells. If sliceId is applied together with cellId, only a part of the load associated with a designated slice among the cell load is transferred to other cells.
ScopeIdentifier also indicates the measurement range for calculating the load specified by prbUsgType in lbObjectives statement. If only cellId is applied, applicable values for prbUsgType are 1-4. If sliceId is applied together with cellId, applicable values for prbUsgType are 5-8.
Regardless of the combination of ScopeIdentifier and lbObjectives statement, lbResources statement indicates the target cells to which the load is transferred.

7.2.9.3.2	Policy status schema
The generic policy status schema in clause 7.1.2.2 is used.
8	A1-EI data model
8.1	Introduction
This clause specifies the application data model supported by the A1-EI API specified in A1AP [3]. The purpose of the data model is to be the basis for
Definition of EI types; and
The EI representation objects that are transported in the body of the A1-EI procedures.
There are two kinds of EI types: those defined by O-RAN and those defined by another entity. EI types need to define:
An EiTypeIdentifier for usage in the A1-EI procedures and URI structure; and
The content to be transported in the body of the A1-EI procedures.
The content is referred to as EI representation objects for the O-RAN defined EI types and is defined by using the A1-EI data model specified in this clause. An EI type defined outside of O-RAN may use the A1-EI data model or another model that covers the content corresponding to the schemas and objects.
The present document covers the data model for O-RAN defined EI types. The O-RAN defined EI types are based on the statements and attributes defined in the data model and may extend it with EI type specific rules and attributes.
The O-RAN defined EI types are defined based on JSON Schema [7]. An EI type is defined by four schemas for EI job definition, EI job constraints, EI job status and EI job result. The schemas are used to validate the EI representation objects transferred in the body of the A1-EI procedures.
8.2	Simple data types and enumerations
8.2.1	Simple data types
The EI job contains URIs for EI job status notifications and EI job results. The simple data types for callback URIs are defined in table 8.2.1-1.
Table 8.2.1-1: General definition of simple data types for callback URIs
The simple data type for JSON schemas is defined in table 8.2.1-2.
Table 8.2.1-2: Definition of JsonSchema
8.2.2	Enumerations
8.2.2.1	JobStatusType
The enumeration JobStatusType represents if an EI job is confirmed to deliver EI results. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 8.2.2.1-1.
Table 8.2.2.1-1: Enumeration JobStatusType
8.2.2.2	GadShapeType
The enumeration GadShapeType represents the different types or shapes of geographic areas. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 8.2.2.2-1.

8.4	EI representations objects
8.4.1	EI type object
The EI type object can be empty or contain EI type specific information.
An EiTypeObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and can contain:
one JSON schema for EiJobDefinition;
one JSON schema for EiJobStatusObject;
one JSON schema for EiJobResultObject; or
one JSON schema for EiJobConstraintsObject.
The type EiTypeObject is defined in table 8.4.1-1.
Table 8.4.1-1: General definition of EiTypeObject
The JSON schema for an EiJobDefinition is used by the A1-EI Consumer to formulate an EI job definition and by the A1-EI Producer to validate an EiJobObject during Create EI job and Update EI job procedures.
The JSON schema for an EiJobConstraintsObject is used by the A1-EI Producer to formulate EI job constraints and by the A1-EI Consumer to validate an EiJobConstraintsObject that is considered when formulating an EI job definition.
The JSON schema for an EiJobStatusObject is used by the A1-EI Producer to formulate EI job status and by the A1-EI Consumer to validate an EiJobStatusObject during Query EI job status and Notify EI job status procedures.
The JSON schema for an EiJobResultObject is used by the A1-EI Producer to formulate EI job results and by the A1-EI Consumer to validate an EiJobResultObject during Deliver EI job result procedures.
The EiTypeObject and the EiJobConstraintsObject can be retrieved using the Query EI type procedure.
8.4.2	EI job object
8.4.2.1	General
An EiJobObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and contains:
one EI type identifier;
one target URI for EI Job results; and
one EI type specific job definition containing one or more EI job definition statements.
and optionally
one target URI for EI Job status notifications.
The type EiJobObject is defined in table 8.4.2-1.
Table 8.4.2-1: General definition of EIJobObject
This definition is general and indicates how to formally construct an EiJobObject. The EI types in clause 9.2 define EI type identifiers and schemas for EI job definitions.
The EI job definition is related to the EI job results, i.e., it can express which of the possible EI job result attributes that should be delivered based on the EI job.
8.4.2.2	Allowed combinations
A job definition statement can be applied together with a ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers attributes. Not all combinations are relevant and different combinations are relevant for different EI types (see clause 9).
8.4.3	EI job status object
An EiJobStatus object is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and always contains:
one EI job status attribute.
Table 8.4.3-1: General definition of EIJobStatusObject
8.4.4	EI job result object
An EiJobResult object is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and it contains
one or more EI job result statements.
8.4.5	EI job constraints object
An EiJobConstraintsObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [6] and it contains
one or more EI job constraints statements.
The content is related to the EI job definition, i.e.; it can express capabilities and limitations related to supported attributes and value ranges for EI job result attributes, and EI job production and delivery attributes.
8.5	Binary data
Binary data is not applicable in this version of the present document.
9	A1-EI data types (EI types)
9.1	Introduction
9.1.1	Identification and compatibility of EI types
An EI type is identified by a EiTypeId as defined in A1AP [3]. The EiTypeId is a string that consists of two parts: a typename and a version.
When updating an EI type, the version in the EiTypeId is updated according to SemVer [19] to reflect its compatibility with other EI types that has the same typename.
Two EI types are considered as different if the EiTypeId is different, i.e. even if the typename is the same and the version only differs in the patch version digit.
Two EI types are compatible in case the typename is the same and the major version digit in the version is the same. In general, two EI types X and Y are compatible when all objects that can be created based on EI type X can be validated by the schemas for EI type Y and all objects that can be created based on EI type Y can be validated by the schemas for EI type X.
9.1.2	Common definitions
9.1.2.1		EI job status
This is a generic EI job status schema, it may be adjusted and used together with an EI job schema in an EiTypeObject and will then be identified by the same EI type identifier as the EI job schema.
{
"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
"description": "O-RAN standard EI status",
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"jobStatus": {
"type": "string",
"enum": [
"ENABLED",
"DISABLED"
]
}
},
"additionalProperties": false,
"required": ["jobStatus"]
}
If an EI type specific status schema contains additional attributes, they are included based on the structure of the generic schema.
9.1.2.2		Scope identifiers and common data types
The EI job definition schemas defined in clause 9.2 can be base schemas that embed a subschema with common data types definitions in same way as described for policy types in clause 7.1.
An EI type definition can link to the common data types schema defined in clause 7.1.2.1 and the compatibility relations are the same as for A1 policy types as described in Annex C. The EI types defined in the present document link to the version of the common data types schema defined in the present document.
It is the compound EI job defintion schemas that are identified by the EI type identifier and included in the EiTypeObject specified in clause 8.4.1.
9.1.2.3		Schema identification
The EI type identifier is part of the $id keyword included in the EI job defintion schema.
The $id keyword for the EI job definition schemas are constructed from the URI base and the EI type identifier in the same was as for policy types as described in clause 7.1.3.2. The base URI for EI types is the same as for policy types.
9.2	EI type definitions
9.2.1	UE location and velocity information
9.2.1.1	EI type identifier
EiTypeId: ORAN_UEGeoandVel_3.0.1
9.2.1.2	Rationale
9.2.1.2.1	Use case
See use case 4: context-based dynamic handover management for V2X, use case 5: RAN slice SLA assurance, and use case 7: massive MIMO optimization in Non-RT RIC and A1/R1 interface: Use Cases and Requirements [1].
9.2.1.2.2	Statements, restrictions and extensions
A UEGeoandVelEIDescription statement can be applied together with ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers. Not all combinations are relevant. Table 9.2.1.2.2-1 indicates the combinations that are allowed.

Annex C (Informative):
JSON schema identification and versioning
C.1	General
The base URI defined in clause 7.1 is used for the policy types and EI types, as well as the subschemas they link to, defined in the present document.
Since the base URI is the same, data types defined in the subschema can be referred to with relative URI, e.g. "/a1td/common_x.y.z/#/$defs/UeId".
C.2	Embedding a subschema
A subschema is defined with $schema and $id keywords, e.g.:
{
"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
"$id": "https://schemas.o-ran.org/jsonschemas/a1td/common_1.0.0",
"$defs": {
...
}
}
A subschema is linked using $defs keyword in the base schema, e.g.:
{
"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
"$id": "https://schemas.o-ran.org/jsonschemas/a1td/ORAN_QoSTarget_4.0.1",
...
"$defs": {
"https://schemas.o-ran.org/jsonschemas/a1td/common_1.0.0":
}
}
In a compound schema, a subschema is embedded into the base
schema after the $defs where it is linked, e.g.:
{
"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
"$id": "https://schemas.o-ran.org/jsonschemas/a1td/ORAN_QoSTarget_4.0.1",
...
"$defs": {
"https://schemas.o-ran.org/jsonschemas/a1td/common_1.0.0":
{
"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
"$id": "https://schemas.o-ran.org/jsonschemas/a1td/common_1.0.0",
"$defs": {
...
}
}
}
}
C.3	Versioning of policy type schemas and common data types schema
C.3.1	General
The common data types schema specified in clause 7.1.2.1 and the policy schemas specified in clause 7.2 can be updated independently but a policy schema update can also require, or be required by, an update of the common data types schema. When the common data types schema is updated, all policy schemas are updated to link to the new version of common data types schema ensuring that all schemas and linking are consistent within the present document.
The following update scenarios can occur:
Policy type is updated but the update has not required a change to the common data types. If the common data types schema is updated, the updated policy schema links to the new common data types schema, and all other policy schemas are updated to link to the new common data types schema.
Policy type is updated and the update has required a change to the common data types. The new policy schema links to the new common data types schema. All other policy schemas are updated to link to the new common data types schema.
The common data types are updated. All policy schemas are updated to link to the new common data types schema. Policy schemas that are impacted by the updated common data types schema also incorporate any required changes.
C.3.2	Versioning of policy types
When updating a policy schema to link to a new common data types schema, the update may result in a major, minor, or patch update to the policy type version
NOTE:		An update of a policy schema may link to a new version of the common data types schema without being impacted by the changes made to it and if it is impacted it can result in an update that is either compatible or not compatible.
When linking to a new version of the common data types schema that has impact on the compatibility of the policy type, the policy type major version is incremented.
When linking to a new version of the common data types schema and no further changes are made to the policy schema, the policy type patch version is incremented.
