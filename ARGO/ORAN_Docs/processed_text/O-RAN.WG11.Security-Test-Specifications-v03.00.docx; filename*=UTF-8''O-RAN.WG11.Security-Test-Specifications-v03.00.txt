	Test and measurement equipment and tools

A list of possible test and measurement equipment and tools required to execute the security tests.

Test tool

Description

Real UE and/or UE emulator

The UE (Real UE or UE emulator) is used to establish stateful end-to-end connection and to generate or receive data traffic.

The real UE used in this context as a test tool is typically a UE which is designed for commercial or testing applications with certain test and diagnostic functions enabled for test and measurements purposes. Such test and diagnostic functions should not affect the performance.

This real UE requires an (emulated) SIM card which is pre-provisioned with subscriber profiles. A UE emulator or multiple real UEs can be used in multi-UE test scenarios requiring multiple UEs sessions. The UE is connected to the SUT either via RF cables or via an over the air (OTA) connection. In a lab environment, the UE should be placed inside an RF shielded box/room to avoid interference from external signals.

The logging tool connected to the UE is used to capture measurements and KPI logs for test validation and reporting.

4G/5G Core or Core emulator

The 4G/5G core or core emulator is used to terminate 4G/5G NAS sessions, and to support core network procedures required for RAN (SUT) testing. 4G/5G core or core emulator must support end-to-end connection and data transfer between Application server and Real UE/UE emulator.

Application (traffic) server

The application (traffic) server is used as an endpoint for generation and/or termination of various data traffic streams to/from Real UE(s)/UE emulator. The application server should be capable to generate data traffic for the services under test.

The application server should be placed as close as possible to the core/core emulator and connected to the core/core emulator via a transport link with sufficient capacity.

Network impairment emulator

The network impairment emulator is used for tests which require insertion of impairment (packet delay and/or jitter) at the network interface (e.g. OpenFH).

Packet generation tool / DoS emulator

The packet generation tool / Denial of Service (DoS) emulator is used for DoS traffic generation of security tests. The tool must support crafting network traffic on network layers from 2 to 7, which conform to network protocols such as: Ethernet, IP, UDP, TCP, PTP, eCPRI, TLS, HTTP/HTTPS. The tool is intended to be deployable in various network segments (communication planes) according to the testing needs.

Packet capture tool

The packet capture tool is used to capture samples of data traffic for validation, analysis, and troubleshooting. In the case of security test cases it can be used to capture samples of legitimate traffic, which then can be used as templates for fuzzing attacks. The tool must support capturing network traffic on network layers from 2 to 7, which conform to network protocols such as: Ethernet, IP, UDP, TCP, PTP, eCPRI, TLS, QUIC, HTTP/HTTPS. The tool is intended to be deployable in various network segments (communication planes) according to the testing needs.

Network tap

A network tap is a hardware or software device which provides access and visibility to the data flowing across a computer network.

Fuzzing tool

The protocol fuzzing tool is used for unexpected protocol input generation of security tests. The tool must support mutating and replaying of captured network traffic on network layers from 2 to 7, which conform to network protocols such as: Ethernet, IP, UDP, TCP, PTP, eCPRI, TLS, HTTP/HTTPS. The tool is intended to be deployable in various network segments (communication planes) according to the testing needs.

Vulnerability scanning tool

The vulnerability scanning tool is used for blind exploitation of well-known vulnerabilities during security tests. The tool should rely on cyclically updated database of known vulnerabilities based on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and should support scanning network services running on TCP/IP stack of protocols. The tool is intended to be deployable in various network segments (communication planes) according to the testing needs.

NFV benchmarking and resource exhaustion tool

The Network Function Virtualization (NFV) tool is used for O-Cloud system performance measurement and resource exhaustion type of DoS attack generation. This tool should be able to be deployed on any types of O-Cloud environment (public or private) with testing VNF(s) and/or CNF(s) support.

SSH audit tool

SSH audit tool is used to verify properties like version of protocol, cipher suites, and known vulnerabilities in configuration of server and client SSH software.

TLS scanning tool

TLS scanning tool is used to verify properties like version of protocol, cipher suites, and known vulnerabilities in configuration of server TLS software.

DTLS scanning tool

DTLS scanning tool is used to verify properties like version of protocol, cipher suites, and known vulnerabilities in configuration of server DTLS software.

IKE scanning tool

IKE scanning tool is used to verify properties like version of protocol, cipher suites, and known vulnerabilities in configuration of server IPsec software.

Software image signing tool

Software image signing tool is used to digitally sign and verify the software image (e.g. xApps or O-RAN component) delivered by the software producer/provider.

Table 51 Test and measurement equipment list

	Test report

Tests should be described in the test report with sufficient detail to allow the tests to be reproducible by different parties and to enable comparison.

	Common Network Security Tests for O-RAN components

	Overview

This chapter contains a set of security evaluations that are performed from outside and inside of the network function in a network capacity. It is used to measure the external exposure and risk(s) of the function in place and leverages common techniques used in cyber security to evaluate the risk(s) device under test faces or has.

The objects in scope of these network-based security tests are SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-eNB and O-Cloud.

	Service Enumeration/ Network Boundary Examination

	STC-7-7.2-001: Service Enumeration

Requirement Name: Network protocols and services

Requirement Reference: Section 5.3.3, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications 4.0 [5]

Requirement Description: A list of network protocols and services supported on the O-RAN component shall be clearly documented by its vendor. Unused protocols shall be disabled.

Threat References: T-O-RAN-01, T-O-RAN-02

O-RAN Component References: SMO, Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU, O-Cloud

	Test description and applicability

Service enumeration is the discovery of network services that are managed or handled by the DUT. Service enumeration for O-RAN component first requires both internal and external "port scans" to discover ports that are servicing application and network protocols.

TCP Port Scanning

Sending a TCP SYN packet to each port. A response with SYN/ACK indicates "port open"

SCTP Port Scanning

Sending a SCTP INIT packet to each possible port. A response with INIT_ACK indicates "port open"

UDP Port Scanning

Sending a UDP packet containing data to each port. A non-response of ICMP Port Unreachable indicates that a service MIGHT be listening.

After each set of ports is scanned, a set of service discovery protocol handshake attempts should be sent to validate if a service is listening or available. For each port, the most likely protocol(s) should be sent to validate if they are present and flagged. If there is a non-match, the data received should be reported in both hexadecimal form and ASCII printable. A few examples:

A TCP port on port 80 is discovered as "open". An HTTP 1.1 GET should be sent, as well as a HTTP2 GET

UDP Port 69 was deemed open. A TFTP read for a random file should be sent, looking for a TFTP ERROR Packet.

SCTP port 38412 was discovered as open. A NG Reset packet should be sent to that port looking for the appropriate response.

	Test setup and configuration

The test requires an allow-list of all allowed network services provided by DUT. The allow-list is used by the tester to  compare against the list of actual identified network service(s) on the DUT produced as a result of the test.

DUT is an O-RAN component listed in the reference above. The allow-list shall be provided by vendor(s) of DUT prior to the test.

	Test procedure

Scan the IP address of the DUT for listening TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports.

For each port determined to be listening, send the expected network handshake typically used on that port, and identify the service offered.

	Test requirements (expected results)

A list of enumerated ports and services on the DUT. Anything that is not included in the allow-list should have an explanation provided as to why it is available and what purpose(s) it serves.

	Test requirements (expected results)

The DUT should deny usage of all passwords which are not compliant with the password policy enforced. The password policy requirements shall be determined by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) baselines and security best practice

	Network Protocol Fuzzing

Fuzzing is an automated process of sending invalid or random inputs to a SUT to cause it to malfunction or crash.

Fuzzing is effective for finding vulnerabilities because while most modern programs have extensive input fields, the test coverage of these areas is relatively small. Even though this process can be a powerful capability to ensure robustness, it needs to be sufficiently defined and implemented throughout the system development lifecycle to be helpful and achieve the required results in a multi-vendor environment.

While traditional fuzzing techniques involve fuzzing piece(s) of software and generating inputs through command line or input files, fuzzing telecommunication network protocols tends to be different, requiring sending information via network ports. Furthermore, the complex nature of network protocols in the SUT resulting from how they are layered over each other adds to the challenges of fuzzing such SUTs.

In the case of O-RAN SUT, fuzzing cover protocols rather than application-specific (web applications and services, etc.). The following are examples of the protocols that fuzzing will cover;

General Transport Protocols

SCTP

IP

TCP

UDP

SSH

HTTP

HTTP/2

and

O-RAN Specific Protocols

NETCONF

E1AP

E2AP

A1

CTI

eCPRI

PTP

It is anticipated that many O-RAN components utilize common software frameworks used for the lower-level general communication. In this case it should be evaluated if these General Transport Protocols are being tested in extensive Fuzzing tests in other activities and can therefore be considered to have lower risk profiles compared to the O-RAN Specific Protocols with less testing in the general industry.

Many of the O-RAN specific protocols are state- machine based protocols that can have multiple end points served at the same time, e.g. the protocol needs to be tested in scale to understand if possible memory leaks or other similar aspects is available that could lead to buffer overflows (opening up for possible code execution) or software crashes of the O-RAN specific software.

Fuzzing on the M-Plane protocol inside the Configuration of the O-RAN Fronthaul can be a possible significant area as this is combining multiple technologies from many domains into a single solution. In order for the Fuzzing to be time and resource efficient, it is important that this Fuzzing is protocol and state machine aware so that the Fuzzing can focus on the relevant aspects of the SUT representing the most significant risk exposure. Further effectiveness can be achieved if the Fuzzing capability is able to intelligently respond to the SUT behavior. The Fuzzing tool should be able to both perform test with and without access to relevant credentials. Many possible vulnerabilities would be present on the inside of the authenticated session of the management protocols and would lead to escalation of privileges.

In order to identify the possible risk for memory leaks, Denial of Service (DoS) or other similar aspects a robust logging of the underlying platform (hardware and software), the virtualization or container platform and the O-RAN function, the logging needs to be detailed enough to evaluate the trends early but not intrusive to degrade the performance of the platform and lead to inaccurate results.

As general guidance, vendors and operators running fuzzing tests aim to document the list of all of the protocols of the SUTs reachable externally on an IP-based interface, together with indications of whether adequate available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used against them. The tool's name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), user settings, and the relevant output evidenced and should be documented. Additionally, any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behavior and a description of this behavior should be highlighted in the testing documentation.

Since fuzzing test cases are not exhaustive and difficult to define and replicate, it's likely that test results even from testing the same set of protocols by different vendors may end up resulting in different outputs. So further effort and time needs to be invested in fuzzing activities until a satisfactory approach based on the vendor's or/and operators adopted risk-based model is satisfied.

DUT is an O-RAN component with 802.1X enabled for its open fronthaul interface.

	Test procedure

First set up the 802.1X test tool host/device as the authenticator with EAP TLS authentication for 802.1X protocol and configure the preset RADIUS server as its authentication server. Then start the test run as an emulated authenticator waiting for the supplicant request.

Configure and enable the O-RAN component open fronthaul interface to start the port connection request as a supplicant towards the 802.1X test tool as the authenticator, and check the 802.1X authentication process to it completion.

The following test scenarios should be covered for validation:

O-RAN component (as supplicant) setting for 802.1X with EAPoL, correct Identity (Certificate DN) and Client Certificate (provisioned on the Radius server)

O-RAN component (as supplicant) setting for 802.1X with EAPoL, correct Identity (Certificate DN) and incorrect Client Certificate (un-provisioned on the Radius server)

O-RAN component (as supplicant) setting for 802.1X with EAPoL and incorrect Identity (Certificate DN)

O-RAN component (as supplicant) setting for 802.1X with EAP non-TLS (e.g. MD5) authentication (optional)

	Test requirements (expected results)

The O-RAN component should be granted or denied the 802.1X port-based network access request as the supplicant with successful or failed EAP authentication per test scenarios listed above:

Successful RADIUS authentication by the authentication server;

Failed RADIUS authentication (wrong certificate) by the authentication server;

Failed RADIUS authentication (wrong Identity) by the authentication server;

Failed RADIUS authentication (wrong authentication type) by the authentication server;

	O1 Interface Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) Validation

Following zero trust principles, O-RAN O1 interface will enforce confidentiality, integrity, authenticity through an encrypted transport, and least privilege access control using the network configuration access control model. The network configuration access control model (NACM) [14] provides the means to restrict access for users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

The security test case in this section validates the NACM enforcement on the O-RAN component O1 interface for the role-based access control.

	STC-17-17.2-001: O1 Interface NACM Validation

Requirement Name: O1 Interface security requirements

Requirement Reference: Section 5.2.2.1, O-RAN Security Requirements Specifications 4.0 [5]

Requirement Description: Requirements of O1 Interface Confidentiality, Integrity & Authenticity protection and Least Privilege Access Control

Threat References: T-O-RAN-02, T-O-RAN-06

O-RAN Component References: Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU

	Test description and applicability

O-RAN component(s) managed by SMO through O1 interface shall support secured NETCONF session over TLS and role-based least privilege access control enforced by NACM [14]. This test validates the O1 interface security requirements of the O-RAN component(s) with the focus on role-based NACM rule(s) set enforcement to further secure the access to NETCONF protocol operations and content.

	Test setup and configuration

First set up an authentication RADIUS server (e.g. free radius on Linux) with proper EAP configuration (eap.conf), then start the authentication RADIUS server.

DUT is an O-RAN component with:

IP enabled O1 interface, reachable to the authentication server;

Proper certificate loaded for the server and necessary certificate authorities (CAs)

Client’s root CA required to validate NETCONF client certificate

Proper TLS Client-to-NETCONF username mapping

	Test procedure

First set up a host/device (e.g. Linux) with TLS client software installed (e.g. OpenSSL), and proper client certificates, keys, the root CA certificate for the server (O-RAN component), and all intermediate CA certificates required to validate the client certificate.

The following test steps should be followed for the validation:

Start the NETCONF-over-TLS session using OpenSSL s_client command to connect with DUT O1 interface using TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 if available with a user account from the O1_nacm_management group

Verify the session is established and mapped to the correct NETCONF user

Verify the global NACM enforcement control setting of

enable-nacm = true

read-default = permit

write-default = deny

exec-default = deny

enable-external-groups = true

Verify the NACM rule sets for the following pre-defined groups

O1_nacm_management

O1_user_management

O1_network_management

O1_network_monitoring

O1_software_management

Close the NETCONF session and TLS connection

Upon availability of the NETCONF operations set(s) definition per NACM group, the NACM rule set(s) enforcement by the DUT should be validated for each of those pre-defined groups listed above.

	Test requirements (expected results)

The O-RAN component should be able to support the NETCONF over TLS session over its O1 interface and NACM enforcement control settings.
