4	General

4.1	Procedure Specification Principles

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:

-	The procedure text discriminates between:

1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed.

	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.

2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed.

	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.

-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.

4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3	Specification Notations

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

Service	when referring to a Service in the specification the SERVICE NAME is written with upper case characters and in bold followed by the word "service", e.g., REPORT service.

Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g., Handover Preparation procedure.

Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g., HANDOVER REQUEST message.

IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g., E-RAB ID IE.

Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., "Value".

4.4	Void

5	E2SM Services

As defined in E2 General Aspects and Principles [1], a given RAN Function offers a set of services to be exposed over the E2 (REPORT, INSERT, CONTROL and/or POLICY) using E2AP [3] defined procedures. Each of the E2AP Procedures listed in table 5-1 contains specific E2 Node RAN Function dependent Information Elements (IEs).

6	RAN Function Service Model Description

6.1	RAN Function Overview

For the purposes of this E2 Service Model, E2SM-CCC, the E2 Node terminating the E2 Interface is assumed to host one or more instances of the RAN Function “Cell Configuration and Control” which performs the following functionalities:

-	E2 REPORT services used to expose node level and cell level configuration information

-	E2 CONTROL services used to initiate control and/or configuration of node level and cell level parameters

This E2SM specification provides a set of RAN Function exposure services described in clause 6.2 and has been prepared with the assumption that the same E2SM may be used to describe either a single RAN Function in the E2 Node handling all RAN cell configuration and control related processes or more than one RAN Function in the E2 Node with each instance handling a subset of the cell configuration and control related processes on the E2 Node.

6.2	RAN Function exposure services

6.2.1	REPORT service

The “Cell Configuration and Control” RAN Function provides selective support of the following REPORT services:

-	Node level configuration information in E2 Nodes

-	Cell level configuration information in E2 Nodes

6.2.2	INSERT service

6.2.3	CONTROL service

The “Cell Configuration and Control” RAN Function provides selective support of the following CONTROL services:

-	Node level configuration and control in E2 Nodes

-	Cell level configuration and control in E2 Nodes

6.2.4	POLICY service

6.3	REPORT service description

The E2SM-CCC REPORT service requirements defined in Section 6.2.1 are offered using a set of REPORT Styles.  All REPORT styles are implemented using a set of IEs that constitute “Action Definition”, “RIC Indication Header” and “RIC Indication Message” to deliver “Cell Configuration and Control” related REPORT services. Each REPORT service style is associated with a specific “Event Trigger” approach. For each Report style, a single RAN Parameter table is used to specify the required information to be reported.

The following REPORT styles are supported:

-	Node level configuration information in E2 Nodes

-	Cell level configuration information in E2 Nodes

6.4	INSERT service description

6.5	CONTROL service description

The E2SM-CCC CONTROL service requirements defined in Section 6.2.3 are offered using a set of CONTROL Styles. Each style corresponds to a set of “CONTROL Action”, where each “CONTROL Action” deals with a specific functionality and has a set of associated RAN parameters, provided in a mapping table. All CONTROL Service styles are implemented using a set of Ies constituting a “RIC Control Request Header” and a “RIC Control Request Message” to deliver “Cell Configuration and Control” related CONTROL services. A “CONTROL Action” containing one or more RAN parameters and their associated values can either be sent from the RIC, either asynchronously to the E2 node or as a response to a previous “INSERT Indication” from the E2 node.

The following CONTROL styles are supported:

-	Node level configuration and control in E2 Nodes

-	Cell level configuration and control in E2 Nodes

6.6	POLICY service description

7	RAN Function Description

7.1	RAN Function Definition

The E2AP [3] procedures E2 Setup and RIC Service Update are used to transport the RAN Function Description.

For a specific RAN Function declared using E2SM-CCC, the RAN Function Definition IE, defined in clause 9.2.2.1 shall report the following information:

-	RAN Function name along with associated information on E2SM definition

-	Event trigger styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.

-	RIC REPORT Service styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.

-	RIC INSERT Service styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.

-	RIC CONTROL Service styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.

-	RIC POLICY Service styles list along with the corresponding encoding type for each associated E2AP IE.

For the case where RAN Function Definition IE, defined in clause 9.2.2.1, is present in the E2 SETUP REQUEST message the IE shall provide a complete list of all supported node-level RAN Configuration Structures and associated Attributes, Services including Styles, Actions and Formats along with a complete list of Cells and associated supported cell-level RAN Configuration Structures and associated Attributes, Services including Styles, Actions and Formats for all supported RIC services reflecting the current status of the RAN Function.

For the case where RAN Function Definition IE, defined in clause 9.2.2.1, is present in the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message within the E2AP RAN Functions Added List IE, the IE shall provide a complete list of all supported node-level RAN Configuration Structures and associated Attributes, Services including Styles, Actions and Formats along with a complete list of Cells and associated supported cell-level RAN Configuration Structures and associated Attributes, Services including Styles, Actions and Formats for all supported RIC services for the newly added RAN Function with a new RAN Function ID.

For the case where RAN Function Definition IE, defined in clause 9.2.2.1, is present in the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message within the E2AP RAN Functions Modified List IE, the IE shall provide a complete list of all supported node-level RAN Configuration Structures and associated Attributes, Services including Styles, Actions and Formats along with a complete list of Cells and associated supported cell-level RAN Configuration Structures and associated Attributes, Services including Styles, Actions and Formats for all supported RIC services including both modified and unchanged information for an existing RAN Function.

The RAN Configuration Structures associated with each RIC Service described in Section 7 are listed here in Section 8. RAN Configuration Structures are groupings of RAN configuration attributes, which can either be based on the NRM definitions in 3GPP TS 28.541 [6] where applicable or extended / newly introduced by O-RAN specifications. RAN Configuration Structures and their corresponding set of attributes are used by the E2SM-CCC RIC services.

The following subsections introduce E2SM-CCC RAN Configuration Structures and their attributes as well as the necessary information to enable their support in each RIC service. Section 8.8 provides the definitions for each RAN Configuration Structure and its respective attributes. The attributes of RAN Configuration Structures which are based on 3GPP NRM definitions include respective 3GPP standard definitions of these RAN configuration structure attributes as referenced in the tables below under the “Semantics Description” column. These attributes, which have 3GPP standard definitions, are not freshly defined or redefined in this specification.

The attributes, whose corresponding value in the “Is Writable” column in the configuration structure is FALSE, shall not be modified by the Near-RT RIC; however, such attributes shall serve as a reference to other attributes, which are bound to the same configuration structure.

For e.g., in the RAN configuration structure O-RRMPolicyRatio (in Sections 8.8.1.4 and 8.8.2.4), the value of the “Is Writable” field for the resourceType attribute is FALSE since the resourceType IE indicates the type of the RRM policy resource, which could be a) PRB DL or PRB UL for the O-NRCellDU defined in Section 8.8.2.2 or the O-GNBDUFunction defined in Section 8.8.1.1 or b) number of RRC connected UEs for the O-NRCellCU defined in Section 8.8.2.1 or the O-GNBCUCPFunction  defined in Section 8.8.1.2 or c) the DRB for the O-GNBCUUPFunction defined in Section 8.8.1.3. Therefore, the attribute value for the resourceType IE cannot be modified by the Near-RT RIC, but can be used within the RIC CONTROL Service for other purposes (e.g., serving as a reference to the other attributes; rRMPolicyMaxRatio, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio, rRMPolicyMemberList within the structure O-RRMPolicyRatio for any given instance of the RAN configuration structure).

8.1.1	RIC Event Trigger Definition

Node-level and cell-level event triggers can be configured periodically or upon a configuration change within the E2 Node based on the RAN Configuration Structures defined in Section 8.3. In the E2 node RAN function “CCC”, there can be one or more instances of these RAN configuration structures, where a local copy of the attributes for each instance shall be maintained for modifying and managing their values. If Near-RT RIC subscribes to periodic events (see event trigger style 2 defined in Section 7.3.3), the RAN function “CCC” in the E2 node shall trigger events in a certain period defined in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE. On the other hand, if Near-RT RIC subscribes to E2 configuration changes (see event trigger style 1 defined in Section 7.3.2), the RAN function “CCC” in the E2 node shall trigger an event upon subscription and when the specified list of the configuration attributes pertaining to any instance of the RAN configuration structures (listed here in Section 8), provided by the Near-RT RIC in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE, undergoes a change (e.g. modification in its value). If the list of configuration attributes is not provided for any RAN configuration structure by the Near-RT RIC in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE, then the RAN function “CCC” in the E2 node shall trigger an event when any attribute in the listed configuration structures in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE undergoes a change. This change in the value of the configuration attribute can be caused either by an internal operation in the E2 node or due to a management operation carried out by a management function (such as the SMO) over a management interface (such as O1) or a dSON operation, etc.

An example use case for configuration change event triggers is when O-RRMPolicyRatio RAN configuration structure is used for managing radio resources for two different slices (e.g., eMBB and URLLC) in the same NR Cell. In this case, there will be two instances of the O-RRMPolicyRatio (in Section 8.8.2.4) created for the same NR Cell, with one instance (e.g., O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1) used for managing PRB resource allocation of the eMBB slice and another instance (e.g., O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2) used for managing the PRB resource allocation of the URLLC slice of the same NR Cell. During subscription, if the Near-RT RIC includes O-RRMPolicyRatio in the RAN Configuration Structure Name IE under the List of RAN Configuration Structures IE corresponding to the NR Cell in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE (Section 9.2.1.1.2) and includes rRMPolicyMinRatio attribute and rRMPolicyMaxRatio attribute for the Attribute Name IE under the List of Attributes IE in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE, then the RAN function “CCC” in the E2 node shall trigger the RIC event whenever rRMPolicyMinRatio attribute or rRMPolicyMaxRatio attribute changes in O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 for the NR cell and/or whenever any of these attributes change in O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2 for the same NR cell.

In the E2 node, the RAN function “CCC” shall also trigger an event in case of other configuration changes pertaining to the node or the cells, such as creation of a new instance or deletion of an existing instance of any configuration structure (listed here in Section 8), as specified by the Near-RT RIC in the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE.

Examples include triggering an event in the E2 node when a new instance of the O-NRCellCU is created, which happens whenever a new NR cell is added to the E2 node, or triggering an event in the E2 node when a new instance of the O-BWP is created, which happens whenever a new bandwidth part (BWP) is added to the NR cell, given by the Global Cell Id IE (in Section 9.2.1.1.2), in the E2 node. Additional examples include triggering an event in the E2 node when an existing instance of the O-RRMPolicyRatio is deleted, which happens when an existing RRM policy pertaining to the E2 node (related to the RRC connected users for the O-CU-CP E2 node or the DRB policy for the O-CU-UP E2 node) is deleted.

 8.1.2	RIC Action Definition

When an event is triggered by the RAN function “CCC” within the E2 node pertaining to one or more RAN configuration structures, the RAN function “CCC” in the E2 Node shall execute the actions as defined in RIC Action Definition IE in Section 9.2.1.2.

Using E2SM-CCC Action Definition Formats 1 and 2 (Section 9.2.1.2.1 and 9.2.1.2.2), the Near-RT RIC shall specify which RAN configuration structures and which attributes pertaining to these structures shall have to be reported, when the corresponding event is triggered in the E2 node. The requested RAN configuration structures are provided in the RAN Configuration Structure Name IE listed under the List of Node-level Configuration Structures IE in Section 9.2.1.2.1 or under the List of Cell-level Configuration Structures IE in Section 9.2.1.2.2. The requested attributes for that specific RAN configuration structure are provided in List of Attributes IE.

When the Report Type IE is ‘All’, then the E2 node shall generate a report indication action involving every instance of the respective RAN configuration structure whether there has been a configuration change (addition/deletion/modification, as discussed in Section 8.1.1) or not. If the List of Attributes IE is not included in the RIC Action Definition IE, then the E2 node shall report the attribute-value pair for all the attributes defined within the respective RAN configuration structure, pertaining to each instance of the configuration structure; whereas, if the List of Attributes IE is included in the RIC Action Definition IE, then the E2 node shall only report the attribute-value pair for the specific list of attributes within the respective RAN configuration structure, pertaining to each instance of the configuration structure.

When the Report Type IE is ‘Change’, then the E2 node shall generate a report indication action involving only those instances of the respective RAN configuration structure that underwent a configuration change among all. Depending on the inclusion of List of Attributes IE, all or specified list of attribute-value pairs shall be present for those changed RAN configuration structure instances. Finally, when Global Cell Id IE is present, then the reporting shall be done only for the specified cell(s).

For e.g., An NR Cell has two instances of O-RRMPolicyRatio configuration structure, namely O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, for managing the RRM policy ratio of PRB allocation in the cell for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively. The RIC Event Trigger Definition IE is defined such that the event must be triggered when the rRMPolicyMinRatio attribute of any instance, O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and/or O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, undergoes a change. The following cases present details of how the E2 node shall generate the report actions for different RIC Action Definition IE contents, for this example.

Case 1: In the RIC Action Definition IE, Cell Global ID IE of the NR Cell is specified (Section 9.2.1.2.2), Report Type IE is ‘All’ and List of Attributes IE is not included, and the instance O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 underwent a configuration change. In this case, the E2 node shall generate a report action including both the instances, O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2 (irrespective of whether any of their attributes has changed or not) within the List of Configuration Structures Reported IE and include all attribute-value pairs as defined in Section 8.8.2.4, in respective IEs; For the unchanged O-RRMPolicyRatio instance(s), i.e. O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, current values for all attributes shall be present in Values of Attributes IE whereas for the modified O-RRMPolicyRatio instance(s), i.e. O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, in addition to reporting the current values for all attributes in Values of Attributes IE, the old values of all attributes shall be reported in Old Values of Attributes IE.

Case 2: In the RIC Action Definition IE, Cell Global ID IE of the NR Cell is specified (Section 9.2.1.2.2), Report Type IE is ‘All’ and List of Attributes IE is mentioned in the RIC Action Definition IE and includes the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, and the rRMPolicyMaxRatio attribute. In this case, again the E2 node shall generate a report action including both the instances, O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2 (irrespective of whether any of their attributes has changed or not)  within List of Configuration Structures Reported IE, but shall now include only the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio attribute-value pairs in respective IEs since only those attributes are listed to be reported in the List of Attributes IE. For the unchanged O-RRMPolicyRatio instance(s), i.e., O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, current values for these four attributes shall be present in Values of Attributes IE whereas, for the modified O-RRMPolicyRatio instance(s), i.e., O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, in addition to reporting the current values for these four attributes in Values of Attributes IE, the old values of these four attributes shall be reported in Old Values of Attributes IE.

Case 3: In the RIC Action Definition IE, Cell Global ID IE of the NR Cell is specified (Section 9.2.1.2.2), Report Type IE is ‘Change’ and List of Attributes IE is not included. In this case the E2 node shall generate a report indication action only involving the changed instance of O-RRMPolicyRatio, i.e., O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, within the List of Configuration Structures Reported IE and include all attribute-value pairs as defined in Section 8.8.2.4 for the instance O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, reporting the current values for all attributes in Values of Attributes IE and reporting the old values of all attributes for the same instance in Old Values of Attributes IE.

Case 4: In the RIC Action Definition IE, Cell Global ID IE of the NR Cell is specified (Section 9.2.1.2.2), Report Type IE is ‘Change’ and List of Attributes IE is mentioned in the RIC Action Definition IE and includes the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, and the rRMPolicyMaxRatio attribute. In this case again the E2 node shall generate a report indication action only involving the changed instance(s) of O-RRMPolicyRatio, i.e., O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, within the List of Configuration Structures Reported IE, but shall now include only the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio attribute-value pairs in respective IEs since only those attributes are listed to be reported in the List of Attributes IE. The E2 Node shall report current values for these four attributes for the instance O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 in Values of Attributes IE and shall report the old values of these four attributes for the same instance in Old Values of Attributes IE.

The details of the approach for the Report Indication action, Insert Indication action and the Policy action are discussed in Sections 8.1.3, 8.1.4 and 8.1.6, respectively.

8.1.3	Report Indication

When the E2 node executes a Report Indication action, it shall report the attribute-value pairs for the relevant list of attributes (as detailed in Section 8.1.2 and Section 9.2.1.2) from the instances of the configuration structures. The Change Type IE provided by the E2 Node in the RIC Indication Message IE (Sections 9.2.1.4.1 and 9.2.1.4.2) corresponds to the type of the event. As discussed in Section 7.3 and Section 8.1.1, the RAN function “CCC” in the E2 node shall generate events by any of the following triggers: modification in the value of the configuration attributes in the instances of the configuration structures (Change Type IE is ‘Modification’), addition of new instances of configuration structures pertaining to the E2 nodes or the cells (Change Type IE is ‘Addition’), deletion of existing instances of configuration structures pertaining to E2 nodes or cells (Change Type IE is ‘Deletion’), upon subscription, and/or periodic timer events (Change Type IE is ‘None’).

In case of attribute-value modifications within the E2 Node, then the E2 node shall report the attribute-value pairs for the list of attributes (specified in the RIC Action Definition IE) before the modification as well as after the modification using the Old Values of Attributes IE and the Values of Attributes IE, respectively (Change Type IE is ‘Modification’). These IEs contain the structure of the attribute-value pairs for the relevant list of attributes. Since there can be multiple instances for any RAN configuration structure (as detailed in Section 8.1.1) pertaining to the E2 nodes or cells, the E2 node shall include both the Old Values of Attributes IE as well as the Values of Attributes IE in order to enable the Near-RT RIC to discover the correct instances of the configuration structures, for which the E2 node reports the relevant list of attribute-value pairs.

For illustrative purposes, the example O-RRMPolicyRatio use case presented in Section 8.1.1 can be used again where there are 2 instances of the O-RRMPolicyRatio RAN configuration structure, namely O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, that are used for managing PRB resource allocation of the eMBB and URLLC slices in the same NR Cell. When the RIC event trigger is caused due to modification in the values of O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, if the RIC Action Definition IE includes the Report Type IE whose value is set to ‘All’ and the List of Attributes IE which includes the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, and rRMPolicyMaxRatio attributes, then the E2 node shall report these four attributes for both O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2.

For O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1, the E2 node shall report the value of ChangeType IE as ‘Modification’ and report old values for resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio attributes (before modification) for the eMBB slice served by the NR Cell in the Old Value of Attributes IE and shall report the new values for these attributes in the Value of Attributes IE. However, for O-RRMPolicyRatio_2, the E2 node shall report the value of ChangeType IE as ‘None’ and the current values of the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio attributes for O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, pertaining to the uRLLC slice served by the same cell, shall be reported in the Value of Attributes IE in the E2SM-CCC RIC Indication message IE contents since there has been no modification in O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2.

This reporting of attribute-value pairs for the list of attributes in both the Old Value of Attributes IE and the Value of Attributes IE, in the case of modification, enables the Near-RT RIC to discover the correct instance of the RAN configuration structure, when there is more than one instance of the same RAN configuration structure assuming key attributes are configured to be present in Report Indication action which depends on the use case and the RAN configuration structure. In order to guarantee identification of the correct instance within the Near-RT RIC in all cases, during subscription Near-RT RIC should not include List of Attributes IE in RIC Action Definition IE for all attributes to be reported in RIC Indication.

As another example, when a new instance of the O-RRMPolicyRatio RAN configuration structure is created (e.g., O-RRMPolicyRatio_DRB_3) due to the creation of a new RRM policy for the resource type DRB, within the E2 node O-CU-UP, and when the RIC Action Definition IE includes the Report Type IE whose value is set to ‘Change’ and the List of Attributes IE, which includes the resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio attributes, then the E2 node shall report the value of ChangeType IE as ‘Addition’ and shall report the attribute-value pair of all these attributes in the Value of Attributes IE. Since the configuration change is not due to modification in the value of an attribute but due to the creation of a new O-RRMPolicyRatio in the E2 node, the E2 node shall not report the Old Value of Attributes IE. Likewise, if an instance of the O-RRMPolicyRatio RAN configuration structure is deleted, then the E2 node shall report the value of ChangeType IE as ‘Deletion’ and shall only report the attribute-value pair of all these attributes in the Value of Attributes IE pertaining to the deleted O-RRMPolicyRatio instance.

8.1.4	Insert Indication

8.1.5	Control Action

When the Near-RT RIC executes a control action, it shall provide the attribute-value pairs for the list of attributes that the Near-RT RIC shall control for the instances of the RAN configuration structures. The Near-RT RIC shall specify the RAN configuration structures that it controls using the RAN Configuration Structure Name IE (in RIC Control Message IE, specified in Section 9.2.1.7) under the List of Configuration Structures IE for the E2 node or for the list of cells specified using the List of Cells IE (in Section 9.2.1.7.2).

For each RAN configuration structure, the Near-RT RIC shall include the Old Values of Attributes IE and the New Values of Attributes IE. These IEs contain the structure of the attribute-value pairs for the entire list of attributes of the configuration structures that the Near-RT RIC shall control on the E2 nodes. Since there can be multiple instances for any RAN configuration structure (as detailed in Section 8.1.1) pertaining to the E2 nodes or cells that the Near-RT RIC controls, the Near-RT RIC shall include both the Old Values of Attributes IE as well as the New Values of Attributes IE in order to enable the E2 node to determine the correct instances of the RAN configuration structures for which the values of the attributes shall be modified by the RIC.

The RAN function “CCC” in the E2 node shall determine the correct instances of the RAN configuration structures using the Old Values of Attributes IE containing the current attribute-value pairs and replace them with the attribute-value pairs in the New Values of Attributes IE, as specified by the Near-RT RIC, for those instances.

As an example, similar to the O-RRMPolicyRatio use case presented in Section 8.1.1 where there are 2 instances of the O-RRMPolicyRatio RAN configuration structure, namely O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2, the Near-RT RIC can control PRB resource allocation for these eMBB and URLLC slices in the same NR Cell by utilizing the RIC CONTROL Service. In order to do so, the Near-RT RIC shall modify the values of the O-RRMPolicyRatio attributes (e.g., rRMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio, rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio) for O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2 for the same NR cell (of type O-NRCellDU). For each O-RRMPolicyRatio instance, the Near-RT RIC shall first include the old values of the respective O-RRMPolicyRatio attributes (resourceType, rRMPolicyMemberList, RMPolicyMinRatio, rRMPolicyMaxRatio, rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio) of the NR cell in the Old Value of Attributes IE. Second, the Near-RT RIC shall include all the unchanged and new values of the respective O-RRMPolicyRatio attributes requested by the Near-RT RIC that the E2 node shall replace with, in the New Value of Attributes IE. When there is more than one instance of the RAN configuration structure (e.g. O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_1 and O-RRMPolicyRatio_PRB_2 in this example scenario), the E2 node shall determine the correct instance of the RAN configuration structure from the attribute-value pairs included in the list of attributes in both the Old Value of Attributes IE and the New Value of Attributes IE to be able to modify the correct instance and its respective attribute values.

9.3.21	partitionList

This IE is used to represent list of frequency partitions for per-slice interference control among cells as an O-RAN specific attribute added in O-NRCellDU defined in 8.8.2.2. The IE is used for O-DU scheduling algorithm to accommodate the interference control, configured by Near-RT RIC through analysis and control of per-slice interference. The frequency range of a partition is defined with two parameters of pOffsetToPointA and pNumberOfRBs, both expressed in units of RB. For example, assuming 15KHz subcarrier spacing for FR1, one RB is 180KHz and 60 KHz subcarrier spacing for FR2, one RB is 720KHz, according to 3GPP TS 38.211 [7], 4.4.4.1 and 4.4.4.2. Based on the per-slice-per-UE RSRP/CQI measurements collected from E2SM-KPM among multiple cells, Near-RT RIC analyzes possible aggressor cells of each slice in terms of reliability requirement in RAN Slice SLA assurance, and it allocates resources for aggressor cells not to use the same RB resources with the victim cell and informs O-DUs of their recommended resource allocations. The partitionList IE is for the DU’s internal allocation of resources and need not be sent to the UE.
