1	Scope
The present document provides profiles for C-plane procedures and functions to achieve interoperability among different vendors. The profile specifies the expected behavior of each node, e.g., message flow of each use case, definitions of IEs, etc. which is not specified in 3GPP specifications. The profile specification provided in this document does not violate 3GPP specifications.
The use cases in this specification cover selected 3GPP functionalities. 
In the IE tables:
If optional IEs are essential for a use case to work, they are categorized ‘included’ in the IE tables.
If optional IEs are used under certain conditions applicable for this use case, they are categorized ‘optionally included’.
If optional IEs are not essential for the use case, they are set to ‘not included’.
One or more use cases described in this document can be initiated in a single procedure if this is allowed by 3GPP specifications. In these cases, the IE tables need to be augmented and the ‘included’ IEs of the procedure are the combination of ‘included’ IEs of the individual use cases, unless otherwise specified in 3GPP.
In addition, it is also possible to combine the initiation of one or multiple use cases of this document with other functions of the 3GPP procedure as defined in the relevant 3GPP specifications.
The use cases are described based on following two architectures defined by 3GPP for 5G.
For a description of the overall architecture in E-UTRA NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) also known as NR Non-Standalone (NSA) as depicted in Figure 1-1 see TS 37.340 [1].
Figure 1-1:	EN-DC Overall Architecture
The overall architecture of NG-RAN as shown in Figure 1-2 is described in TS 38.300 [6].
Figure 1-2:	NG-RAN Overall Architecture
1.1	UE connectivity options used in this document
The 3GPP architecture provides different options in the way a UE can connect to the network. Throughout this document the configuration options as explained in the following chapters are used. Note that these chapters focus on explaining the connectivity for the profiled use case. There might be additional bearers such as MCG or default bearers that are not shown in the figures.
1.1.1	NR Non-Standalone (NSA)
In the NSA architecture the UE relies on LTE access to attach to EPC network and uses NR as secondary RAT for increased throughput using dual connectivity. In this version of the specification EN-DC is used with different options to establish the UP bearer(s).
1.1.1.1	SN terminated SCG bearer (‘Option 3a’)
First UE connectivity option is typically referred to as ‘Option 3a’. The PDCP and S1-U terminate in en-gNB acting as Secondary Node (SN). From there SCG bearers are used to convey UP data to/from the UE (‘SN terminated SCG bearer’).
Figure 1.1.1.1-1:	SN terminated SCG bearer (‘Option 3a’)
1.1.1.2	SN terminated split bearer (‘Option 3x’)
This UE connectivity option also terminates UP PDCP in SN en-gNB, but the SN en-gNB splits the UP bearer in two legs utilizing X2-U and, if applicable F1-U, to send / receive UP data to/from the UE via bearer using RLC in both, MCG and SCG. This UE connectivity option is referred to as ‘Option 3x’ or ‘SN terminated split bearer’.
Figure 1.1.1.2-1:	SN terminated split bearer (‘Option 3x’)
1.1.1.3	SN terminated MCG bearer
This UE connectivity option terminates the UP PDCP and S1-U in the SN en-gNB. The SN en-gNB establishes a UP bearer leg utilizing X2-U to send and receive UP data to and from the UE via bearers using RLC in the MCG. This UE connectivity option is referred to as ‘SN terminated MCG bearer’.
Figure 1.1.1.3-1:	SN terminated MCG bearer
1.1.2	NR Standalone (SA)
In NR SA, also referred to as ‘Option 2’, the NG-RAN based on gNB RAN nodes only is connected to 5GC, i.e. no EPC is involved and ng-eNBs are not considered to be part of NG-RAN.
1.1.2.1	NR-DC with SN terminated Split bearer
In case a UE connects with option 2 and uses NR-NR dual connectivity (NR-DC) this specification in its current version is profiling cases where MN and SN are gNBs. 3GPP shows options to terminate NG-U on MN, SN or both. Current version of this specification considers use cases with PDCP terminated on SN. SN splits the UP bearer in a leg via Xn-U and, if applicable F1-U, to convey UP data via bearer using RLC in both, MCG and SCG (‘SN terminated split bearer’).
When profiling the NR SA SN terminated split bearer cases it was further assumed that MN is serving FR1 cells with a larger coverage area than FR2 cells served by SN.  By that the amount of unwanted mobility inter MN mobility events is reduced.

Section 11: GENERAL
This Agreement is governed by the laws of Germany without regard to its conflict or choice of law provisions.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its express subject matter and expressly supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations with respect to its and its Affiliates’ performance under this Agreement, including without limitation, export control and antitrust laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Adopter acknowledges that this Agreement prohibits any communication that would violate the antitrust laws.
By execution hereof, no form of any partnership, joint venture or other special relationship is created between Adopter, or O-RAN Alliance or its Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no party is authorized to make any commitment on behalf of Adopter, or O-RAN Alliance or its Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors.
In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with governing law or if any provision is held to be null, void or otherwise ineffective or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, (i) such provisions will be deemed stricken from the contract, and (ii) the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
Any failure by a party or third party beneficiary to insist upon or enforce performance by another party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement or otherwise by law shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of the other parties’ or third party beneficiary’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather the same shall be and remain in full force and effect.
