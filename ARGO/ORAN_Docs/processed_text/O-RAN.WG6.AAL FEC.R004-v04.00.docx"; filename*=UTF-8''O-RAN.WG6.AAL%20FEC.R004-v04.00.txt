6 AAL Profile Specifications

6.1 Profile Specifications Overview

This section contains information for each supported AAL profile . A profile may provide several APIs for specific profile configuration in addition to the general AAL configuration APIs. Profile specific configuration shall be applied on a per queue basis and only for functionality that cannot be changed at run time. Each profile shall define a capabilities list that will be used to define the operations supported by the AAL-LPU.

6.1.1 Operation Representation

Operations offloaded to the AAL-LPU are represented by a single operation context that shall include all necessary information required by the AAL Implementation to process the operation.

The operation context defines the operation type as supported by the AAL Profile. It includes an operation status, a reference to the operation specific data, which can vary in size and content depending on the operation/profile being provisioned. Application software is responsible for specifying all the operation-specific fields that are then used by the AAL-LPU to process the requested operation.

Scheduling of AAL operations on an application data path is performed using a burst oriented asynchronous API set. A queue on an AAL-LPU accepts a burst of operations (1 to N number of operations) using enqueue API. The enqueue API will place the operations to be processed on the AAL-LPU’s hardware input. The dequeue API will retrieve any processed operations available from the queue on the AAL-LPU.

6.1.2 Profile Capabaillities

Each Profile has a set of capabilities which capture the functions supported by each implementation. This includes optional features such a interrupts and debug interfaces. The AAL shall provide an API to report the capabilities of the underlying AAL implementation as per clause 5.2.2.

6.1.3 Memory Management

The AAL Implementation shall provide any profile specific memory management (examples allocate and free memory) as required by the AAL Implementation.

6.2 O-DU AAL PDSCH FEC Profile Specification

As per O-RAN AAL GAnP document [7] the PDSCH FEC Profile shall support

CRC Generation

LDPC Encoding

PDSCH Rate Matching

6.2.1 AAL FEC PDSCH Profile Capabilities

The AAL FEC PDSCH Profile interface shall support operations on both a code block (CB) and a transport block (TB) basis.

An operation can be performed on one CB at a time "CB-mode". An operation can be performed on one or multiple CBs that logically belong to a TB "TB-mode".  The input data is the CB or TB input to the encoder. The output data is the ratematched CB or TB data.

The input and output buffers shall be allocated by the application according to 6.1.3.

The input buffer shall contain the input code block or transport block data the operation is to be performed on.

The output buffer is mandatory and is the encoded CB(s). In CB-mode it contains the encoded CB of size e (E in 3GPP TS 38.212 section 6.2.5). In TB-mode it contains multiple contiguous encoded CBs of size ea or eb. The output buffer is allocated by the application with enough room for the output data.

The following modes of operation shall be supported:

CB-mode: one CB (with CRC24B appended to the output buffer if required)

CB-mode: one CB making up one TB (with CRC16 or CRC24A appended to the output buffer if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB of a partial TB (with CRC24B(s) appended to the output buffer if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB of a complete TB (with CRC16, CRC24A and CRC24B(s) appended to the output buffer if required)

The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile shall list the CRC’s supported in its capabilities. The AAL Implementation of the AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile shall provide the flexibility for the application to configure the operation in CB-mode with application selected CRC type and TB-mode with application selected CRC type.

In CB-mode an application can select whether CRC24A is appended to the CB or not. If configured not to append CRC24A then the application not the AAL Implementation, shall calculate and append CRC24A before calling AAL. The input data length is inclusive of CRC24A/B where present and is equal to the code block size K’. Note that code block length will always be a multiple of 8 and it is assumed that there are 8 bits packed into each byte.

In TB-mode, the input data length shall equal the total size of the CBs inclusive of any CRC24A and CRC24B..

In the case of a partial  TB  the AAL Application shall provide the index of the first CB in the group of CBs and the number of CBs in the group..

The number of CBs in the group should not be confused with c, the total number of CBs in the full TB (C as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.2.2).

When using CB-mode, concatentation of the output code blocks into a transport block, is not performaned by the AAL Implementation.

The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities shall be reported to the application as per Table 5.2.2-1: AAL-LPU Capabilities . The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities are defined in Table 6.1.1.1-1: AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile Capabilities, these capabilities shall be reported to the application andmay not be implemented by the AALi implementation. BG: a bit unlcear what’s being specified- the application function of AAL functions here.

PUSCH Rate De-matching

LDPC Decoder

CRC Check

NOTE:  the AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile only supports PUSCH Forward Error Correction. It shall not include support for PUSCH UCI

6.3.1 AAL FEC PUSCH Profile Capabilities

The decode operations are invoked through enqueue and dequeue functions. The operation context defines the parameters used to configure the operation to be accelerated. These parameters are defined in 6.3.2.

The input and output buffers shall be allocated by the application according to 6.1.3.The input buffer shall contain the encoded CB data to be decoded and is the Virtual Circular Buffer data stream with null padding. Each byte in the input circular buffer is the LLR value of each bit of the original CB.

The output buffer shall contain the hard_output which is the decoded CBs of size K’ (CRC24A/B or CRC16 is the last 24bit or 16bits in each decoded CB. The AAL Implementation shall give the option to drop the CRC. Where CRC Drop is set then the CRC will not be present at the end of the buffer). In transport block mode the hard_output will contain the decoded transport block.

The AAL Implementation may support the optional soft output buffer which is an LLR rate matched output of size e (this is E as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 6.2.5).

The AAL Implementation may support optional harq input buffer which is a buffer with the input to the HARQ combination function. If the AAL-LPU supports internal memory capability and is enabled, then the HARQ shall be  stored in the  AAL-LPU internal memory and shall not visible to the application.

The AAL Implementation may support the optional HARQ Combined output which is a buffer for the output of the HARQ combination function of the AAL-LPU. If the AAL-LPU supports internal memory capability and is enabled, then the  HARQ is stored in memory internal to the AAL-LPU and not visible to application.

As with the AAL PDSCH FEC Profile, the decode interface works on both a code block (CB) and a transport block (TB) basis.

The following modes of operation shall be supported:

CB-mode: one CB (CRC24B if required)

CB-mode: one CB making up one TB (CRC16 or CRC24A if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB making up a partial TB (CRC24B(s) if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB making up a complete TB (CRC16, CRC24A and CRC24B(s) if required)

The buffer length is inclusive of CRC24A/B where present and is equal the code block size K’.

The first CB Virtual Circular Buffer (VCB) index is given by r but the number of the remaining CB VCBs shall be calculated  by the AAL implementation.

The input buffer length shall equal the total size of the CBs inclusive of any CRC24A and CRC24B in case they were appended by the application.

6.3.1.1 LLR Compression

The AAL PUSCH FEC Profile may support compression of the LLR bits used for the HARQ data. This improves PCIE memory bandwidth and memory storage. LLR compression support shall be reported through the AAL to the application..

6.3.1.2 Summary of AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile capabilities
