Introductory material
1.1	Scope
This Technical Specification has been produced by the O-RAN Alliance.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Release xx.yy.zz
where:
xx	the first two-digit value is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document shall have xx=01).
yy	the second two-digit value is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.
zz	the third two-digit value is included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process; externally published documents never have this third two-digit value included.
The present document specifies the data model and the data types that are used in the body of the procedures in the A1 interface. It is part of a TS-family covering the O-RAN WG2: A1 interface as identified below: “General Aspects and Principles”. “Transport Protocol”. “Application Protocol”. “Type Definitions”.
1.1.1	Compatibility of A1 type definitions
The version number of the present document indicates that there may be implications for the compatibility between implementations of policy types and/or EI types defined in different versions of this specification.
The first two-digit value of this specification is incremented when
at least one policy type and/or one EI type has been added or removed
and/or
at least one policy type and/or one EI type has been updated in a non-backward compatible way.
The first two-digit value of this specification is incremented when at least one policy type and/or one EI type has been updated in a backward compatible way.
Policy type compatibility is described in Chapter 5 and EI type compatibility is described in Chapter 7.
The compatibility of A1 implementations in Non/Near-RT RICs depends on the policy types and/or EI types that are implemented. The present document handles the compatibility for data types used by the A1 services while A1 interface: Application Protocol [4] handles the A1 service compatibility aspects.

A1 Application data model
This document together with the A1 interface: Application Protocol [4] contains a REST method realization of the A1 interface architecture and the A1 procedures identified in A1 interface: Generic Aspects and Principles [3].
The A1 interface: Application Protocol specification [4] contains the service description, service operations, resource indicators and the API definition (including the OpenAPI document) for the A1 services. The present document contains the data model and the defintions of the objects transported in the procedures defined for the A1 services.
The data types defined in this document are life cycled independently from the A1 services defined in the A1 interface: Application Protocol [4]. The documentation of the A1 data models follows the application data model used for API definitions in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] and data types specified in 3GPP TS 29.571 [6]. It is based on structured data types and objects as specified in IETF RFC 8259 [7] and JSON schema [8].
Generic aspects and common data types
3.1		Encoding of attributes in A1 data types
The encoding of 3GPP attributes into JSON is based on their original definitions, and their value ranges, rather than on encodings used in other protocols or solutions sets. The definitions are referred to in the data type definitions (see clauses 4.2 and 4.3) and the corresponding encodings are seen in the type definitions (see clause 5.1.2 and 5.2).
A1-P Data Model
4.1	Introduction
This clause specifies the application data model and data types supported by the A1-P API (see A1 interface: Application Protocol [4]). The data model is based on policy statements that include attributes and are combined with a scope identifier into policy objects.
For policy objectives, policy statements for the following characteristics are defined:
-	QoS targets;
-	QoE targets;
-     UE level targets;
-	Slice SLA targets;
-	Load balancing targets.
For policy resources, policy statements for the following characteristics are defined:
- 	Traffic steering optimization;
-	Slice SLA assurance;
-	Load balancing.
4.2	Simple data types and enumerations
This clause defines attributes to be used for scope information and attributes that are not defined as part of the statements (structured data types as defind in coming clauses).
Simple data types and enumerations can be referenced from structured data type and policy types.
4.2.1	Simple data types
Table 4.2.1-1: Definition of simple data types for scope and statements
4.2.2	Enumerations
4.2.2.1	PreferenceType
The enumeration PreferenceType represents the preference of a specific network resource (e.g. cell usage). It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 4.2.2.1-1.
Table 4.2.2.1-1: Definition of PreferenceType
4.2.2.2	EnforcementStatusType
The enumeration EnforcementStatusType represents if a policy is enforced or not. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 4.2.2.2-1.
Table 4.2.2.2-1: Definition of EnforcementStatusType
4.2.2.3	EnforcementReasonType
The enumeration EnforcementReasonType represents the reason why notification is sent (e.g. why enforcement status has changed). It also represents the latest reason for change of enforcement status to NON_ENFORCED in case policy status is queried. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 4.2.2.3-1.
Table 4.2.2.3-1: Definition of EnforcementReasonType
4.3	Structured data types
4.3.1	ScopeIdentifier
In A1 interface: Generic Aspects and Principles [3], A1 policies are defined as containing a scope identifier and one or more policy statements where policy statements contain policy objectives and/or policy resources. This clause defines the structured data type ScopeIdentifier.
The ScopeIdentifier contains the following attributes:
Table 4.3.1-1: Definition of data type ScopeIdentifier
Note1: Presence condition "C" means that least one attribute shall be included when the scope is defined. The allowed combinations of attributes depend on the policy statement that is combined with the ScopeIdentifier, see Chapter 5.
Note 2: Encoding of 3GPP attributes into number and string is described in Chapter 3 and applied to the JSON encodings in Chapter 5.
4.3.1.1	SliceId
SliceId is based on the definition of S-NSSAI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [12]) and includes a PLMN identifier.
Table 4.3.1.1-1: Definition of type SliceId
4.3.1.2	GroupId
GroupId is defined based on different RF selection priority parameters for 4G and 5G networks. GroupId does not explicitly define a UE group, and does not enable any group management operations, but is a property that several UE can share and thereby enables implicit identification of a dynamic set of UEs for which the same policy can be applied.
Table 4.3.1.2-1: Definition of type GroupId
Note: Presence condition "C" means that one and only attribute shall be included when this data type is used.
4.3.1.3	QosId
QosId is defined based on different QoS identifiers for 4G and 5G networks.
Table 4.3.1.3-1: Definition of type QosId
Note: Presence condition "C" means that one and only attribute shall be included when this data type is used.
4.3.1.4	CellId
CellId is based on the definition of the global cell identifiers ECGI and NCGI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [12]) for 4G and 5G RANs.
Table 4.3.1.4-1: Definition of type CId
Note: Presence condition "C" means that one and only attribute shall be included when this data type is used.
Table 4.3.1.4-2: Definition of type CellId
4.3.1.5	PlmnId
This clause contains the definition of the structured data type PlmnId. PlmnId is based on the definition in 3GPP TS 23.003 [12].
Table 4.3.1.5-1: Definition of type PlmnId
4.3.2	Structured data types for statements
This clause contains definitions of structured data types that are used in statements for policy objectives and/or statements for policy resources.
Table 4.3.2-1: Definition of type CellIdList
Table 4.3.2-2: Definition of type TaI
Table 4.3.2-3: Definition of type TaIList
4.3.3	Statements for policy objectives
In A1 interface: Generic Aspects and Principles [3], A1 policies are defined as containing a scope identifier and one or more policy statements where policy statements contain policy objectives and/or policy resources. This clause defines the structured data types and attributes to be used for policy objectives.
4.3.3.1	Introduction
Table 4.3.3.1-1 specifies the data types defined for policy objectives in the A1-P interface protocol. The possible combinations of these are defined in Chapter 5.
Table 4.3.3.1-1: Statements for policy objectives
4.3.3.2	QoS target
The QosObjectives statement contains the following attributes:
Table 4.3.3.2-1: Definition of statement type QosObjectives
Note: Presence condition "C" means that least one attribute shall be included when this statement is used.
4.3.3.3	QoE target
The QoeObjectives statement contains the following attributes:
Table 4.3.3.3-1: Definition of statement type QoeObjectives
Note 1: Presence condition "C" means that least one attribute shall be included when this statement is used.
Note 2: In this version of the specification, the QoE target is applicable to video streaming services.
Application server will measure the QoE related attributes (e.g. MOS, initial buffering, reBuffFreq, stallRatio) for a specific service based on application info. However, it’s too late for network to optimize the radio resource when the application server find the QoE is too bad. The Near-RT RIC could predict the QoE related attributes based on the network side info (e.g. QoS parameters, radio conditions, Packet measure report etc.) e.g. by performing model inference for a specific ML model received from the Non-RT RIC. The predicted value is approximately the QoE related attribute which will be measured at application server later, but it’s estimated at the Near-RT RIC in real time. So, the Near-RT RIC could decide to optimize the radio resource based on the predicted value and the QoE target contained in the A1 policy.
4.3.3.4	 UE level targets
The UeLevelObjectives statement contains the following attributes:
Table 4.3.3.4-1: Definition of statement type UeLevelObjectives
Note1: Presence condition "C" means that least one attribute shall be included when this statement is used.
The ReliabilityType represents the success probability of transmitting a data packet of X bytes within a certain delay. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 4.3.3.4-2.
Table 4.3.3.4-2: Definition of type ReliabilityType
4.3.3.5	Slice SLA target
The SliceSlaObjectives statement contains the following attributes:
Table 4.3.3.5-1: Definition of statement type SliceSlaObjectives
NOTE 1: Presence condition "C" means that at least one attribute shall be included when this statement is used.
NOTE 2: The usage of guaDlThptPerSlice, maxDlThptPerSlice, guaUlThptPerSlice and maxUlThptPerSlice attributes by the Near-RT RIC is out of scope of the present specification. The usage is still under consideration and FFS by WG3. For further details, see WG3 specifications; for example, the O-RAN WG3 UCR [20].
NOTE 3: The attribute usage is evolving in WG3 and their definitions in the present document may be revised based on the progress of WG3.
4.3.3.6	 Load balancing targets
The LbObjectives statement contains the following attributes:
Table 4.3.3.6-1: Definition of statement type LbObjectives
4.3.4	Statements for policy resources
In A1 interface: Generic Aspects and Principles [3], A1 policies are defined as containing a scope identifier and one or more policy statements where policy statements contain policy objectives and/or policy resources. This clause defines the structured data types and attributes to be used for policy resources.
4.3.4.1	Introduction
Table 4.3.4.1-1 specifies the data types defined for policy resources in the A1-P interface protocol. The usage of these is defined in Chapter 5.
Table 4.3.4.1-1: Statements for policy resources
4.3.4.2	Traffic steering preference
The TspResources statement is defined in Table 4.3.4.2-2 as an array of the type TspResource defined in Table 4.3.4.2-1.
Table 4.3.4.2-1: Definition of type TspResource
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the attribute shall be included when this statement is used while "O" means that it is optional to include.
Table 4.3.4.2-2: Definition of statement type TspResources
When the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER or AVOID, the cellIdList contains cells in descending order of importance for how they should be preferred or avoided, e.g. the first entry is most preferred or most avoided.  When the preference value is set to SHALL or FORBID, the cellIdList contains cells that are of equal importance.
When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the value of the preference attribute is set to SHALL, then only a cell in the cellIdList is to be used as primary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER, then a cell in the cellIdList may be used as primary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to true, and the preference value is set to AVOID or FORBID, then no cell in the cellIdList is to be used as primary cell.
When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the value of the preference attribute is set to SHALL, then only one or more cells in the cellIdList are to be used as secondary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the value of the preference attribute is set to PREFER, then one or more cells in the cellIdList may be used as secondary cell. When the value of the primary attribute is set to false, and the preference value is set to AVOID or FORBID, then no cell in the cellIdList is to be used as secondary cell.
When the primary attribute is not included, the statement shall be handled in the same way as when the primary attribute is set to false.
4.3.4.3	Slice SLA Policy Resources
The SliceSlaResources statement is defined in Table 4.3.4.3-1.
Table 4.3.4.3-1: Definition of type SliceSlaResources
Note: Presence condition "C" means that at least one attribute shall be included and only one of them shall be used when this statement is used.
4.3.4.4	Load Balancing Policy Resources
The LbResources statement is defined in Table 4.3.4.4-1.
Table 4.3.4.4-1: Definition of type LbResources
4.4	Policy representations objects
This clause contains the formal representation definitions of the policy representation object types defined in the A1-P service decription in A1 interface: Application Protocol [4].
4.4.1	Policy object
4.4.1.1	General
A PolicyObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and it always contains one set of:
one ScopeIdentifier,
and
one or more Statements.
Table 4.4.1.1-1: General definition of PolicyObject
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the data type shall be included in a PolicyObject. Allowed combinations are listed in Chapter 5. Presence condition "C" means that at least one Statement (for policy objectives and/or policy resources) shall be included. Presence condition “O” means that the data type can be optionally included in a PolicyObject.
This definition is general and indicates how to formally construct a PolicyObject. The policy types in Chapter 5 defines PolicyObjects for usage in the A1 procedures defined in A1 interface: Application Protocol [4].
4.4.1.2	Allowed combinations
A Statement can be applied together with a ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers attributes. Not all combinations are relevant and different combinations are relevant for different policy types (see Chapter 5).
4.4.2	Policy status object
A PolicyStatusObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and contains:
one enforceStatus attribute and, conditionally, one enforceReason attribute.
Table 4.4.2.1: General definition of PolicyStatusObject
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the data type shall be included in a PolicyStatusObject used with the PolicyObjects defined in current specification. A PolicyObject and a PolicyStatusObject for a future policy type may be defined based on other attributes. Presence condition "C" means that the enforceReason shall only be included in case enforceStatus is NON_ENFORCED.
4.4.3	Policy type object
A PolicyTypeObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and it contains:
one JSON schema for PolicyObject,
and
one JSON schema for PolicyStatusObject.
The JSON schema [8] for a PolicyObject is used by the A1-P Producer to validate a PolicyObject during Create policy and Update policy procedures. The JSON schema [8] for a PolicyStatusObject is used by the A1-P Consumer to validate a PolicyStatusObject during Query policy status and Feedback policy procedures. The PolicyTypeObject can be retrieved using the Query policy type procedure.
4.5	Binary data
Binary data is not applicable in this version of the specification.
A1-P Data Types (Policy Types)
A policy type is identified by a PolicyTypeId as defined in A1 interface: Application Protocol [4]. The PolicyTypeId is a string that consists of two parts: a typename and a version.
When updating a policy type, the version in the PolicyTypeId is updated according to SemVer [21] to reflect its compatibility with other policy types that has the same typename.
Two policy types are considered as different if the PolicyTypeId is different, i.e. even if the typename is the same and the version only differs in the patch version digit.
Two policy types are compatible in case the typename is the same and the major version digit in the version is the same.
5.1	Common definitions
5.1.1		Policy Status
This is a generic policy status schema, it may be adjusted and used together with a policy schema in a PolicyTypeObject and will then be identified by the same policy type identifier as the policy schema.

See Use case 3: QoS based resource optimization in Non-RT RIC & A1 interface: Use Cases and Requirements [2].
5.2.1.2.2	Statements, restrictions and extensions
A QoS statement can be applied together with ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers. Not all combinations are relevant. The following table indicates combinations that are allowed.
Table 5.2.1.2.2-1: Allowed combinations of qosObjectives statement with ScopeIdentifier
Note: on each row is listed a combination of identifiers that is allowed for the indicated statement. Notation is the same as for caridinality: "0" means the identifier shall not occur, "0..1" means the identifier may occur and "1" means the identifier shall occur. Only at most one occurance of an identifier is allowed in the present version.

A lbObjectives statement can be applied together with ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers. Not all combinations are relevant. Table 5.2.8.2.2-1 indicates combinations that are allowed.
ScopeIdentifier is used to designate a cell from which load needs to be transferred to other cells. If sliceId is applied together with cellId, only a part of the load associated with a designated slice among the cell load is transferred to other cells.
ScopeIdentifier also indicates the measurement range for calculating the load specified by prbUsgType in lbObjectives statement. If only cellId is applied, applicable values for prbUsgType are 1-4. If sliceId is applied together with cellId, applicable values for prbUsgType are 5-8.
Regardless of the combination of ScopeIdentifier and lbObjectives statement, lbResources statement indicates the target cells to which the load is transferred.

A1-EI Data Model
6.1	Introduction
This clause specifies the application data model supported by the A1-EI API (see A1 interface: Application Protocol [4]). The purpose of the data model is to be the basis for
Definition of EI Types;
The EI representation objects that are transported in the body of the A1-EI procedures.
There are two kinds of EI Types: those defined by O-RAN and those defined by another entity. EI Types need to define:
An EiTypeIdentifier for usage in the A1-EI procedures and URI structure;
The content to be transported in the body of the A1-EI procedures.
The content is referred to as EI representation objects for the O-RAN defined EI Types and is defined by using the A1-EI data model specified in this subclause. An EI Type defined outside of O-RAN may use the A1-EI data model or another model that covers the content corresponding to the schemas and objects.
This specification covers the data model for O-RAN defined EI types. The O-RAN defined EI Types are based on the statements and attributes defined in the data model and may extend it with EI type specific rules and attributes.
The O-RAN defined EI Types are defined based on JSON schemas [8]. An EI Type is defined by four schemas for EI job, EI job constraints, EI job status and EI job result. The schemas are used to validate the EI representation objects transferred in the body of the A1-EI procedures.
6.2	Simple data types and enumerations
6.2.1	Simple data types
The EI job contains URIs for EI job status notifications and EI job results.
Table 6.2.1-1: General definition of simple data types for callback URIs
6.2.2	Enumerations
6.2.2.1 JobStatusType
The enumeration JobStatusType represents if an EI job is confirmed to deliver EI results. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 6.2.2.1-1.
Table 6.2.2.1-1: Enumeration JobStatusType
6.2.2.2 GadShapeType
The enumeration GadShapeType represents the different types or shapes of geographic areas.
Table 6.2.2.2-1: Enumeration GadShapeType
6.2.2.3 VelocityDescType
The enumeration VelocityDescType represents the different types of UE velocity descriptions.
Table 6.2.2.3-1: Enumeration VelocityDescType
6.3	Structured data types
6.3.1	ScopeIdentifier
The ScopeIdentifier is EI type specific.
If the ScopeIdentifier contains attributes corresponding to the A1 policy ScopeIdentifier, they are the same as defined for A1-P, see Chapter 5.
6.3.2	Statements for EI job definition
6.3.2.1 Introduction
This clause defines the structured data type and attributes to be used for EI job definition, which are summarized in Table 6.3.2.1-1.
Table 6.3.2.1-1: Statements for EI job definition
6.3.2.2 UE geo-location and velocity information
The UEGeoandVelEIDescription statement contains the following attributes:
Table 6.3.2.2-1: Definition of UEGeoandVelEIDescription
Note 1: Presence condition "M" means that the attribute shall be included while "O" means that it is optional to include.
Note 2: Event-triggered measurement and reporting is FFS.
6.3.3	Statements for EI job result
6.3.3.1 Introduction
This clause defines the structured data type and attributes to be used for EI job result definition, which are summarized in Table 6.3.3.1-1.
Table 6.3.3.1-1: Statements for EI job result definition
6.3.3.2 UE geo-location and velocity EI
The UEGeoandVelEIResult statement contains the following attributes:
Table 6.3.3.2-1: Definition of UEGeoandVelEIResult
Note: Presence condition "C" means that the attribute shall be included if the attribute “velocityDesc” is included.
The GeoLocationType is defined as a list of following mutually exclusive alternatives.
Table 6.3.2.2-2: Definition of GeoLocationType
The VelocityType is defined as a list of following mutually exclusive alternatives.
Table 6.3.2.2-3: Definition of VelocityType
6.3.4	Statements for EI job constraints
6.3.4.1 Introduction
This clause defines the structured data type and attributes to be used for EI job constraints.
Table 6.3.4.1-1: Statements for EI job constraints
6.3.4.2 UE geo-location and velocity information
The UEGeoandVelEIConstraints contains the following attributes:
Table 6.3.4.2-1: Definition of UEGeoandVelEIConstraints
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the attribute shall be included while "O" means that it is optional to include.
6.4	EI representations objects
6.4.1	EI type object
The EI type object can be empty or contain EI type specific information.
An EiTypeObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and can contain:
one JSON schema for EiJobObject;
one JSON schema for EiJobStatusObject; and
one JSON schema for EiJobResultObject;
and optionally
one JSON schema for EiJobConstraintsObject.
Note:	The detailed definition of the EiTypeObject and the relation with the EiJobObject, EiJobConstraintsObject, EiJobStatusObject and EiJobResultObject is FFS.
The JSON schema [8] for an EiJobObject is used by the A1-EI Consumer to formulate an EI job and by the A1-EI Producer to validate an EiJobObject during Create EI job and Update EI job procedures.
The JSON schema [8] for an EiJobConstraintsObject is used by the A1-EI Producer to formulate EI job constraints and by the A1-EI Consumer to validate an EiJobConstraintsObject that is considered when formulating an EI job.
The JSON schema [8] for an EiJobStatusObject is used by the A1-EI Producer to formulate EI job status and by the A1-EI Consumer to validate an EiJobStatusObject during Query EI job status and Notify EI job status procedures.
The JSON schema [8] for an EiJobResultObject is used by the A1-EI Producer to formulate EI job results and by the A1-EI Consumer to validate an EiJobResultObject during Deliver EI job result procedures.
The EiTypeObject and the EiJobConstraintsObject can be retrieved using the Query EI type procedure.
6.4.2	EI job object
6.4.2.1	General
An EiJobObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and contains:
one EI Type identifier;
one target URI for EI Job results;
one target URI for EI Job status notifications;
one ScopeIdentifier; and
one EI type specific job definition containing one or more EI job definition statements.
Table 6.4.2-1: General definition of EIJobObject
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the data type shall be included in an EI job object for EI Types based on the current specification. Presence condition "C" means that the data type shall be included in an EI job object unless corresponding information is included in the jobDefinition. Additional attributes may be defined for a specific EI Type.
This definition is general and indicates how to formally construct an EiJobObject. The EI types in clause 7 define EiJobObjects for usage in the A1 procedures defined in A1 interface: Application Protocol [4].
The EI job definition is related to the EI job results, i.e., it can express which of the possible EI job result attributes that should be delivered based on the EI job.
6.4.2.2	Allowed combinations
A job definition statement can be applied together with a ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers attributes. Not all combinations are relevant and different combinations are relevant for different EI types (see Chapter 7).
6.4.3	EI job status object
An EiJobStatus object is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and always contains:
one EI job status attribute.
Table 6.4.3-1: General definition of EIJobStatusObject
Note: Presence condition "M" means that the data type shall be included in an EI job status object for EI Types based on the current specification. Additional attributes may be defined for a specific EI Type.
6.4.4	EI job result object
An EiJobResult object is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and it contains
one or more EI job result statements.
6.4.5	EI job constraints object
An EiJobConstraintsObject is based on IETF RFC 8259 [7] (JSON) and it contains
one or more EI job constraints statements.
The content is related to the EI job definition, i.e.; it can express capabilities and limitations related to supported attributes and value ranges for EI job result attributes, and EI job production and delivery attributes.
6.5	Binary data
Binary data is not applicable in this version of the specification.
A1-EI Data Types (EI Types)
An EI type is identified by a EiTypeId as defined in A1 interface: Application Protocol [4]. The EiTypeId is a string that consists of two parts: a typename and a version.
When updating an EI type, the version in the EiTypeId is updated according to SemVer [21] to reflect its compatibility with other EI types that has the same typename.
Two EI types are considered as different if the EiTypeId is different, i.e. even if the typename is the same and the version only differs in the patch version digit.
Two EI types are compatible in case the typename is the same and the major version digit in the version is the same.
7.1	Common definitions
7.1.1		EI job status
This is a generic EI job status schema, it may be adjusted and used together with an EI job schema in an EiTypeObject and will then be identified by the same EI type identifier as the EI job schema.
{
"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
"description": "O-RAN standard EI status",
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"jobStatus": {
"type": "string",
"enum": [
"ENABLED",
"DISABLED"
]
}
},
"additionalProperties": false,
"required": ["jobStatus"]
}
If an EI type specific status schema contains additional attributes, they are included based on the structure of the generic schema.
This generic schema in clause 5.1.2 includes the encoding of ScopeIdentifier data types that can be used with the job definition statement in an EI job.
If an EI type specific scope identifier contains additional attributes, or other attributes, they are included based on the structure of the generic schema.
7.2	EI type definitions
7.2.1 UE location and velocity information
7.2.1.1 EI Type identifier
EiTypeId: ORAN_UEGeoandVel_1.0.0
7.2.1.2 Rationale
7.2.1.2.1 Use case
See use case 4: context-based dynamic handover management for V2X, use case 5: RAN slice SLA assurance, and use case 7: massive MIMO optimization in WG2 UCR [2].
7.2.1.2.2 Statements, restrictions and extensions
A UEGeoandVelEIDescription statement can be applied together with ScopeIdentifier containing different combinations of identifiers. Not all combinations are relevant. The following table indicates combinations that are allowed.
Table 7.2.1.2.2-1: Allowed combinations of UEGeoandVelEIDescription with ScopeIdentifier
Note 1: on each row is listed a combination of identifiers that is allowed for the indicated statement. Notation is the same as for cardinality: "0" means the identifier shall not occur and "1" means the identifier shall occur.
Note 2: A single UE Id is allowed in the scope in this release of specification. Whether the scope for UEGeoandVelEIDescription statement can be extended to a group of UEs, UEs in a slice, or UEs in a cell is FFS.
