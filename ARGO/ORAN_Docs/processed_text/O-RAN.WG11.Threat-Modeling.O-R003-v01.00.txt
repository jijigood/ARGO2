Definition of terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1], O-RAN [6], [9], [11] and the following apply:
Radio jamming is the deliberate jamming, blocking or creating interference with authorized wireless network. A radio jammer is a transmitter that tunes to the same frequency as the opponents’ receiving equipment and with the same type of modulation, with enough power to override any signal at the receiver.
Radio Sniffing technique helps to decode all sorts of essential network configuration details easily with low-cost software radios. Sniffing information can aid attackers in optimizing and crafting attacks.
RF spoofing refers to transmitting a fake signal meant to pretense as an actual signal.

Overview
Objective and structure
O-RAN architecture [6] differs significantly from the architecture of 3GPP RAN. It involves introducing new components, interfaces, and technologies, which give rise to new actors (stakeholders) and enable novel business models. Consequently, the attack surface expands considerably, and we anticipate that O-RAN design and deployment will present numerous security challenges and associated risks. These challenges primarily stem from various factors, such as the inclusion of O-RAN specific interfaces and components, the utilization of virtualization/containerization techniques, the incorporation of open-source code, and the capability to support AI/ML models, among other considerations.
Additionally, the O-RAN architecture is being developed using zero trust (ZT) and zero trust architecture (ZTA) principles as described in the NIST Zero Trust Architecture Special Publication [26]. Zero trust is an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Zero trust also assumes that an adversary can always be in the network. According to the publication [26], zero trust is based on the following tenets that can be adapted to the O-RAN architecture. Full descriptions of each tenet can be found in [26].
[ZT-1] All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
[ZT-2] All communication is secured regardless of network location.
[ZT-3] Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
[ZT-4] Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy—including the observable state of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset—and may include other behavioral and environmental attributes.
[ZT-5] The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets. No asset is inherently trusted.
[ZT-6] All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
[ZT-7] The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.
Therefore, the security analysis and the threat model for O-RAN must be carefully studied and relevant assets/stakeholders/vulnerabilities/threats/requirements/countermeasures/recommendations must be identified to reduce risk exposure, mitigate any harmful effects, and drive to a ZTA.
The material presented in this analysis aims at supporting various O-RAN stakeholders understanding the relevant threats resulting to an exposure of O-RAN assets by exploiting the vulnerabilities.
The objective is to give a comprehensive and high-level view on how security is organized in O-RAN system. In this document, we assume that 3GPP security requirements are met. Unless explicitly stated, features relate to O-RAN specifications.
This analysis is consolidated from various relevant sources, including main 5G standardization documents and telecommunication best practices (e.g., 3GPP, ETSI, NIST, ENISA).
The first main part outlines the main stockholder roles involved in managing and using O-RAN system. Further, it addresses the prerequisites and assumptions needed to securely implement and run O-RAN systems. It also identifies the list of critical assets to be protected in integrity, availability, confidentiality, replay and authenticity.
The second main part addresses the threat model. It identifies the threat agents, determines the threat surface, identifies vulnerabilities, and lists the threats for each O-RAN component or interface. For each threat, the description, threatened asset(s), vulnerabilities, threat agents and affected components are given.
The third main part describes the security principles to be achieved to counter the identified threats. In addition, it illustrates the coverage between threats and security principles.
The fourth main part is the risk assessment of the identified threats in terms of severity and likelihood.
NOTE 1:  The present document document focuses only on the components, interfaces and protocols specified by O-RAN alliance. Components, interfaces and protocols specified by 3GPP are only referenced where needed but are not within the scope of this specific O-RAN security analysis.
NOTE 2: The present document is a working document with the need to update the content on a regular basis following the risk evaluation.
NOTE 3: In this document, the term NF (Network Function) is used to designate either VNF (Virtual Network Function), CNF (Cloud-native Network Function) or PNF (Physical Network Function).
NOTE 4: Terms “Containers” and “Virtual Machines” are used interchangeably in this document as the implementation of O-RAN SW components could either be container-based, VM-based or hybrid (Containers and VMs together).
Methodology
The methodology adopted in this document is based on the standard ISO 27005 [7] which provide a detailed and flexible structure to release a risk assessment.
Refer to NIST SP 800-154 [13] for the definition of Attack, Attack Surface, Attack Vector, Controls, Risk, Risk Mitigation, Threat, and Vulnerability.
The methodology followed in this document comprises three stages:
Identification
Identify stakeholders: First, we need to identify the stakeholders involved in the implementation, management, operation and maintenance of the O-RAN system. Roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder are given.
Define assumptions: The list of minimum prerequisites and assumptions need to be defined for the operational environment (not under the control of the O-RAN system) required to successfully operate the O-RAN system.
Identify assets: First, we need to locate relevant assets the O-RAN system hold and give details about the type (Data, component, etc.), the security properties (CIA) at rest and in transit and location.
Identify threats: We need to identify the relevant threats associated with the new O-RAN components, interfaces and technologies. In addition, the threat surface and agents are given.
Identify vulnerabilities: O-RAN system may have weaknesses in its new O-RAN components, interfaces and technologies which need to be identified.
Define security principles: We need to define security principles to be achieved in order to reduce risk exposure.
Elaborate and refine security principles: Each security principle needs to be detailed and refined into requirements, recommendations and countermeasures.
Identify existing/ongoing countermeasures: We need to identify all of O-RAN existing/ongoing controls and to take into account the protection provided by these controls before applying any new ones.
Risk assessment
The value for Risk is defined by the following equation:
Risk = (the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability) x (total impact of the vulnerability being exploited)
Risk treatment
Now that we know the level of risk that each threat poses, we need to decide how we’ll treat them. There are four options:
Modify the risk by implementing a control to reduce the likelihood of it occurring.
Avoid the risk by ceasing any activity that creates it. This response is appropriate if the risk is too big to manage with a security control.
Share the risk with a third party. There are two ways: by outsourcing the security efforts to another organization or by purchasing cyber insurance to ensure the funds to respond appropriately in the event of a disaster.
Retain the risk. This means that the organization accepts the risk and believes that the cost of treating it is greater than the damage that it would cause.
Perimeter
This clause comprises the architecture in the scope of the security analysis. The architecture includes the list of O-RAN components, interfaces and protocols manipulating critical assets and implementing security functions.
Scope regarding architecture
As specified in [6], the logical architecture of O-RAN includes the following components, interfaces and protocols:

3GPP interfaces are already studied and maintained by 3GPP,
UE,
MEC,
Core,
Antennas.
Statement of compatibility with 3GPP
This chapter gives the statement of compatibility with 3GPP/SCAS security Assets, Threats and Requirements. The statement of compatibility shows that 3GPP Assets/Threats/Requirements are applicable and that there is no conflict affecting the security of O-RAN components.
Assets and Threats
Table 5-1 : Statement of compatibility with 3GPP – Assets and Threats
In addition, the assets/threats related to the additional specific O-RAN interfaces and components are considered. As a result, clauses 6.3 and 7.4 elaborates the O-RAN specific assets and threats respectively.
Security requirements
Table 5-2 : Statement of compatibility with 3GPP – Security requirements
In addition, O-RAN also needs to consider the security requirements related to the additional specific O-RAN interfaces and components. As a result, clause 8 focus on the O-RAN security principles.
Roles-Assumptions-Assets
Stakeholders roles and responsibilities
The main stakeholders managing and using the O-RAN system are the following:
Table 6-1 : Roles and responsibilities

Threat model
Threat surface
The O-RAN architecture [6] introduces new functions and interfaces. The introduction of additional interfaces and nodes, and the decoupling of hardware and software, expands the threat and attack surface of the network. For the purposes of this document, threat surfaces are divided into six (6) main groups:
Additional functions: SMO, Non-Real-Time RIC, Near-Real-Time RIC
Additional open interfaces: A1, E2, O1, O2, Open Fronthaul
Modified architecture: Lower Layer Split (LLS) 7-2x
Decoupling increases threat to Trust Chain
Containerization and Virtualization: Disaggregation of software and hardware
Exposure to public exploits may be increased due to use of Open Source Code
The following entry points are considered:
API between planes which facilitate the propagation of threats
Threats coming from inside the O-RAN system
Threats coming from outside the O-RAN system

The threats listed here below are generic to cover the ML model and not refined at ML components (training and inference hosts) due to the various deployment scenarios that are considered for ML architecture/framework in O-RAN. For the purposes of this document, the deployment scenarios are:
Scenario 1.1: SMO/Non-RT RIC acts as both the ML training and inference host.
Scenario 1.2: Non-RT RIC acts as the ML training host and the Near-RT RIC as the ML inference host
Scenario 1.3: Non-RT RIC acts as the ML training host and the O-CU/O-DU as the ML inference host
The involved components and interfaces within each scenario are:
Scenario 1.1: SMO/Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU, SMO internal/O1/A1 interfaces
Scenario 1.2: SMO/Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU, O1/O2/A1/E2 interfaces
Scenario 1.3: SMO/Non-RT RIC, O-CU, O-DU, O-RU, O1/O2 interfaces
For more information about ML security risks and controls, see the risk analysis of ML systems released by BIML [18].
Protocol Stack Threats
The A1 and R1 interfaces use the REST protocol stack shown in the figure below.  The transport network layer is built on IP transport. TCP provides the communication service at the transport layer.  HTTP is the application-level protocol used providing reliable transport of messages.  TLS provides secure HTTP connections for secure transport of messages.  The application layer protocol is based on a RESTful approach with transfer of JSON formatted policy statements. Each of these protocols has known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a malicious actor.

Coverage matrix of threats
From the above threats, a threat inventory is developed to provide a mapping between threats, vulnerabilities and assets. For the purposes of this document, threats have been grouped into two categories:
‘O-RAN specific’ comprises threats directly relating to O-RAN components and interfaces
‘General’ covers threats relating to physical, open source, virtualization, IoT and radio aspects
The threat inventory provides details of each individual threat: threat agents, vulnerabilities, threatened assets and affected components.
Table 7-1 : O-RAN Threat Inventory
Security principles
This clause elucidates security principles that an O-RAN system should achieve. They provide high level and abstract statement of the intended solution to countering potential Threats. Each security principle references applicable ZT tenets.
Principles (SP)
SP-AUTH Mutual Authentication
Mutual authentication SHOULD be established to allow the O-RAN system verifying who performs what, thus possible to detect fake base stations, unauthorized or malicious components, malicious applications and malicious users/administrators.
ZT Tenets: ZT-2, ZT-3, ZT-4, ZT-6
SP-ACC Access Control
The O-RAN system SHOULD forbid unauthorized administrators or components to access O-RAN resources or services anytime and anywhere. Access controls are required for:
Network Access Controls for filtering unauthorized/unexpected traffic in the O-RAN components over their interfaces.
Access controls to restrict access to component configurations.
Access controls for hardware to maintain the trust chain.
ZT Tenets: ZT-3, ZT-4, ZT-6
SP-CRYPTO Secure cryptographic, key management and PKI
Well-known, standardized, secure and unbroken cryptographic schemes and protocols SHOULD be used. Proprietary schemes and protocols SHOULD be avoided.
A secure key management of O-RAN keys (KgNB, KRRC-enc, KRRC-int, KUP-int, and KUP-enc, ksn) SHOULD be implemented to manage all the steps of key lifecycle: key generation using an appropriate level of entropy from a reliable source, secure key storage, key rotation and revocation, secure key destruction, etc.
Reliable PKI for authentication and data encryption SHOULD be used. Public CAs SHOULD be supported. The certificates SHOULD be issued by a trusted or rooted Certificate Authority (CA). The CA implements the Certificate Policy which specifies the rules and policies about who may or may not receive a Certificate. Relying parties can access the Certificate Policy to determine what validation/verification checks were performed prior to certificate issuance.
Each O-RU SHOULD be configured with lists of algorithms which are allowed for usage. There SHOULD be one list for integrity algorithms, and one for ciphering algorithms. These lists SHOULD be ordered according to a priority decided by the operator.
SP-TCOMM Trusted Communication
Integrity, confidentiality, availability, authenticity and replay protection of resources SHOULD be ensured in transit (see ‘Critical Assets’, clause 6.3) over O-RAN interfaces.
ZT Tenets: ZT-2
SP-SS Secure storage
Integrity, confidentiality, availability protection of O-RAN resources SHOULD be ensured at rest (see ‘Critical Assets’, clause 6.3).
SP-SB Secure boot and self-configuration
O-RAN components SHOULD secure their firmware and configuration to provide the opportunity for trust to be extended higher in the software stack. Verified platform firmware can, in turn, verify the operating system (OS) boot loader, which can then verify other software components all the way up to the OS itself, the hypervisor or container runtime layers and O-RAN components. The transitive trust SHOULD be consistent with the concept of the chain of trust (CoT)-a method where each piece of code in the boot process measures and checks the signature of the next stage of the boot process before the software boots.
The secure boot process, signature verification and self-configuration SHOULD be securely implemented for all O-RAN components to authenticate them before loading.
SP-UPDT Secure Update
A secure update management process SHOULD be implemented for introducing a new component or software change into the O-RAN system. The process SHOULD consider the ability to update the cryptographic algorithms and to adapt to upcoming O-RAN security challenges. A timely update cycles if vulnerabilities are discovered SHOULD be in place.
ZT Tenets: ZT-5
SP-RECO Recoverability & Backup
A recoverability process to recovery in case of denial of service SHOULD be implemented. An approach for detecting and mitigating DoS attacks SHOULD be in place.
O-RAN vendors SHOULD define a recovery plan that resets the O-RAN components to a trustworthy state in case of a malfunction or an attack (e.g. DoS).
Backup systems SHOULD be in place to allow data or component on the O-RAN to be secured. Backup systems SHOULD ensure a suitable level of data or component availability and reliability.
ZT Tenets: ZT-7
SP-OPNS Security management of risks in open-source components
Vendors using open-source code SHOULD enhance its security by applying industry coding best practices. It is recommended that vendors practice a higher level of due diligence for exposure to public exploits when using Open-Source code.
A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) SHOULD be maintained to track which open-source components are in use and where.
Security Analysis (Audit, vulnerability scan, etc.) SHOULD be performed to ensure all identified components are free of security vulnerabilities.
A proper policy and process SHOULD be in place for identifying and patching known issues with the open-source components. Open-source software components SHOULD be kept up to date and patched.
ZT Tenets: ZT-5
SP-ASSU Security Assurance
Mobile networks are classified as critical infrastructure making security assurance especially more than relevant:
Vendors SHOULD ensure and prove that its software or hardware meets 3GPP Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS).
Vendors SHOULD ensure and prove that its software or hardware fulfils O-RAN security tests, requirements and recommendations provided by O-RAN alliance.
Vendors SHOULD ensure and prove that their software or hardware meets the needs of many national and international cybersecurity regulations, such as the Cyber Act, GDPR, etc.
Vendors SHOULD provide risk assessment, secure code review, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis and hardening guidelines for their O-RAN components.
SP-PRV Privacy
In O-RAN, the privacy of end users SHOULD be considered. The privacy of end users can be divided into data privacy, identity privacy and personal information privacy. Most Communication services are to gather data and personal information around end users, which may reveal information sensitive to their privacy. Adversaries would further extract more personal information about end users, such as UE priority, location information, trajectory, and preference.
SP-SLC Continuous security development, testing, logging, monitoring and vulnerability handling
Continuous development and continuous integration (CD/CI) with continuous regression testing and software security auditing SHOULD be implemented.
Relevant activities events SHOULD be logged and logs collected SHOULD be analyzed in real time for the identification of potential security attacks and for security auditing.
Continuous monitoring SHOULD be implemented to verify that the wanted security state is maintained throughout the lifecycle of deployed O-RAN components.
Vulnerability management SHOULD be in place with intelligence to continuously track, identify and remediate vulnerable applications. Vendors SHOULD keep track of any new vulnerabilities discovered and is ready to act on customer product security incidents and reported security issues affecting O-RAN components.
ZT Tenets: ZT-7
SP-ISO Robust Isolation
In a multi-vendor environment, intra-domain host isolation SHOULD be enforced. In the same host, VMs, CNs, virtualization/container layer, CPU, storage, and network security isolation of resources SHOULD be ensured by implementing system security orchestration, segmentation, lifecycle management, time scheduling, monitoring and audit on the management, signaling, control and data planes, and the execution of virtualized O-RAN components.
SP-PHY Physical security
The O-RAN system SHOULD be located at physically secure environment in a way that minimizes the risk of resource theft and destruction. It SHOULD support secure storage of sensitive data (cryptographic keys and configuration data), execution of sensitive functions (encryption/decryption, authentication), and execution of boot and update processes.
Special attention SHOULD be paid to the site intrusion and physical access threats against O-RU sites. Consequently O-RU equipment SHOULD disable all unnecessary physical and logical ports, protocols and interfaces. In addition, secure physical connections to O-RU for O&M operations SHOULD be implemented (e.g. secure laptop with secure credentials).
SP-CLD Secure cloud computing and virtualization
Defense methods SHOULD be implemented: virtual machine-based intrusion detection, virtual machine-based isolation, virtual machine-based kernel protection, virtual machine-based access control, and virtual machine-based trusted computing.
SP-ROB Robustness
The O-RAN system SHOULD not only ensure the robustness of software or hardware resources, but also guarantee the robustness of the cognitive radio channel for meeting the QoS of communication services required by users. In some scenarios, the robustness of spectrum sensing SHOULD be enhanced when some sensing nodes (e.g., O-RU) easily malfunction. Robustness is an essential consideration for overcoming the security threats caused by jamming, DoS or DDoS attacks.
Coverage Threats - Security principles
The table below illustrates how threats are covered by security principles. It outlines the list of security principles contributing to counter threats.
Table 8-1 : Coverage Security principles-Threats (1/2)
Table 8-2 : Coverage Security principles-Threats (2/2)
Risk assessment
After identifying the list of assets, threats and vulnerabilities, the next step is the risk assessment. The main concepts of risk assessment are illustrated in the following figure.
Figure 9-1 : Main concepts of risk assessment
The criticality of the identified threats in clause 7.4 were assessed based on the severity (consequence) and the likelihood of occurrence. Indications of severity level for each threat are given whether they are considered as high, medium, or low. This severity is a global perception of the risk based on its impacts. In practice, it varies strongly depending on the use cases and deployment/configuration models of the O-RAN system.
Moreover, the type of loss (availability, integrity and/ or confidentiality) has been assessed for each threat.
Determination of severity level process
The process followed to determine the severity level resulting from threats that successfully exploit vulnerabilities is based on Table 9-1 which includes the definition in terms of Privacy, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability of the three severity levels ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ and ‘High’ shown here as green, yellow and red.
Table 9-1 defines what “low,” “medium” and “high” means.
The severity of an impact is expressed as follows:
Level of impact for various threats on the properties Privacy, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
Scale of impact, depending on the number of affected O-RUs and /or O-DUs.
Scale of impact depending on the Clock Model and Synchronization Topology configurations LLS-C1, LLS-C2, LLS-C3 and LLS-C4 [10].
Adverse impacts depending on whether or not existing requirments and controls are already defined in the O-RAN requirments specifications.
Table 9-1 : Severity rating
NOTE 1: The severity level depends on the number of affected RUs and O-DUs. The severity level is consequently 'Low' in case of one affected O-RU, 'Medium' in case of one affected O-DU with its related multiple O-RUs, and 'High' for multiple affected O-DUs-O-RUs. Operators conducting a full risk analysis according to this report should conduct a use case-based analysis taking into account the likelihood and the real deployment of the O-RAN system.
NOTE 2:
Configuration LLS-C1
In LLS-C1, the network timing is distributed from O-DU to O-RU via direct connection between O-DU site and O-RU site. O-DU is acting as a master and directly synchronizes O-RU.
DoS attacks against the master clock: There are two scenarios:
1.     Scenario 1: One O-RU is served by O-DU, therefore only one O-RU is affected. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.
2.     Scenario 2: Multiple O-RUs are served by O-DU, therefore all those O-RUs are affected as the connection between O-DU and O-RU is point-to-point. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.
Configuration LLS-C2
In LLS-C2, the network timing is distributed from O-DU to O-RU between O-DU sites and O-RU sites. One or more Ethernet switches are allowed in the fronthaul network. O-DU acting as master to distribute network timing toward O-RU.
DoS attacks against the master clock within the O-DU may affect one or multiple O-RUs. In this configuration, a neighbor O-DU could act a backup and play the role of a master to distribute network timing to all the RUs belonging to the affected O-DU by reconfiguring the network of switches. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.
Configuration LLS-C3
Frequency and time distribution is made by the fronthaul network itself (not by the O-DU). One or more PRTC/T-GM are implemented in the fronthaul network to distribute network timing toward O-DU and O-RU.
DoS attacks against the master clock within the fronthaul network may affect multiple O-DUs with their related O-RUs. Consequently, the severity level is ‘High’.
Configuration LLS-C4
Local PRTC timing that provides time synchronization to the O-RU (it could be embedded in the O-RU).
DoS attacks against the master clock may affect only one O-RU. Consequently, the severity level is ‘Low’.
According to what we described in the here above two notes, T-SPLANE-01 has been split in Table 9-4 according to the Clock Model and Synchronization Topology configurations C1, C2, C3, and C4.
NOTE: Adverse impacts: This factor depends on the normative O-RAN security requirements in the security requirements specification. For a threat without any requirement in front of it, the adverse impacts level is High. It is Medium or Low for a threat with related security requirements (see column ‘Assupltions’) helping in reducing its impact.
Determination of likelihood level process
The process followed to determine the likelihood level resulting from threats that successfully exploit vulnerabilities is based on Table 9-2 which includes the relevant factors that are considered. For each factor, three levels ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ and ‘High’ are shown in Table 9-2 as green, yellow and red.
Table 9-2 defines what “low,” “medium” and “high” means.
The likelihood level is expressed by four factors as follows:
Adverse impacts: This factor depends on the existing normative O-RAN security requirements and controls. For example, the level is high in case no available O-RAN security requirements and controls in the O-RAN security specifications. In the risk assessment Table 9-4 in the column ‘Assumptions’, some of the agreed security controls by the O-RAN alliance have been stated for some threats as arguments for justifying the likelihood levels ‘Low’ or ‘Medium. This means that the likelihood level is estimated at Low’ or ‘Medium’, provided that the security controls are in place.
NOTE: This factor is used to determine the likelihood level for the most categories of threats. It is also used as a relevant factor for severity for some categories of threats, in particular the O-Cloud threats category.
Threat event initiation: This factor takes into consideration the capabilities that attackers possess and the potential entry points to exploit a vulnerability and initiate an attack. For example, it is high if an attack can be initiated from internet or untrusted network.
Exposure: This factor is related to the number of external interfaces and/or services that are exposed to an attacker.
Zero Trust Approach: Likelihood scoring considers a zero-trust architecture which protects against internal threat actors.  Likelihood scores are higher for a zero-trust architecture (ZTA) because internal threats should be considered in addition to external threats. In a ZTA it cannot be assumed that perimeter defense is sufficient.  As a result, scored Likelihood = Medium, at a minimum.   Reconnaissance type attacks can be scored Likelihood = High while damaging/availability attacks can be scored Likelihood = Medium.  The reason is that threat actors are less likely to perform damaging attacks that are quickly and easily detected. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) typically move laterally in anonymous fashion to prevent detection while providing reconnaissance (see O-RAN.SFG.Non-RT-RIC-Security-TR-v01.00).
Table 9-2 : Likelihood rating
Evaluation of the risks process
The following risk assessment matrix is used to assess the risk score. The matrix takes as input two estimated qualitative inputs: (i) likelihood and (ii) the severity. One axis representing the probability of a risk scenario occurring and the other representing the damage it will cause (Severity). In the middle, you have scores based on their combined totals.
Using this formula RISK= Severity x Likelihood by a simple multiply the severity and likelihood scores to obtain the final risk score as shown in Table 9-3.
For example, if the estimated likelihood of a threat is low and the corresponding severity is high, then the risk is medium.

The following is the risk assessment output table which illustrates the different threats along with their impacts, the type of loss, the perceived severity/likelihood levels and the risk scoring.
