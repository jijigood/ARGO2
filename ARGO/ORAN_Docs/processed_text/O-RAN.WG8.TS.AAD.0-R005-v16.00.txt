Table 4-1 lists the features and requirements supported by the reference design based on the target release specification. Requirements marked “R1” and ‘R2” are addressed in this release of the document. Requirements below are aligned to deployment requirements in  [25].
Table - Requirements
RAN Architecture
3GPP specifies the 5G RAN architecture and interfaces between the logical functional blocks. The following diagram presents the overall 5G network architecture [12] as well as the logical partition of the main functions.
Figure 5-1 3GPP RAN Architecture
As specified by 3GPP in [12] a gNB may consist of a gNB-CU-CP, multiple gNB-CU-UPs and multiple gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU through the F1-C interface. The gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU through the F1-U interface. The gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-CU-CP through the E1 interface. One gNB-DU is connected to only one gNB-CU-CP. One gNB-CU-UP is connected to only one gNB-CU-CP.
The following diagram represents the separation of the CU control plane and user plane.
Figure 5-2 Overall architecture for separation of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP
As shown in Figure 5-3 [24], O-RAN defines the RAN architecture with a focus on new, open interfaces between the logical nodes and physical partitions of the RAN functions.
Figure 5-3 O-RAN Architecture and Interfaces
O-CU/O-DU Lower Layer Split Architecture
In some RAN deployment scenarios, e.g., a microcell, the physical layer is split between the O-DU and O-RU. O-RAN WG4 defines the open front haul interface which is adopted in the split architecture as shown in Figure 5-3. The O-DU contains the higher physical layer High-PHY functions while the O-RU contains the lower physical layer Low-PHY functions as specified in [22]. The fronthaul software interface is discussed in section 7.10 of this specification.

Channel Estimation: The channel estimation functional block provides a channel estimate based on the DMRS of resource elements of the user data.
MIMO Equalizer: The MIMO equalizer function processes the received IQ data signals to reverse the distortion incurred during the signal transmission over the air. Using the channel information acquired via the channel estimation, the equalizer tries to restore the IQ symbol sent by the transmitter. The symbols may be conveyed as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for use by the LDPC decoder.
Rate Dematching: The rate dematching function performs the reverse operation steps of rate matching for LDPC code in clause 5.4.2 in 3GPP TS38.212 [5].
LDPC Decoder: The LDPC decoder function uses received log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) to compute the data bits based on selected decoder algorithm. The selection of the decoder algorithm is out of scope of this specification.

A Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) carries control information (DCI) such as scheduling information and resource grant to UEs. The PDCCH includes one or more Control Channel Elements (CCE, consists of 6 resource element group) based on the aggregation level defined by 3GPP specification [4]. The PDCCH processing flow is similar to the PDSCH. The PDCCH uses a polar code instead of LDPC. QPSK modulation is the designated modulation scheme for the PDCCH bits block.

Front Haul Module
The fronthaul module supports the open fronthaul interface specified by O-RAN Fronthaul Specification [22] lower level split distributed gNB architecture [22]. The detailed requirements and control and data plane protocols are described in O-RAN Fronthaul CUS-plane specification. The module is responsible for communication between the O-DU and O-RU. The fronthaul module processes incoming O-RAN Fronthaul CUS-plane packets and constructs outgoing CUS-plane packets. Figure 7-6 illustrates an example implementation of hardware accelerated packet processing related to the fronthaul interface.
Figure -: Fronthaul library and interfaces
The FH library APIs are listed in the following table.
Table - Fronthaul library APIs
O-DU Timing Synchronization
In order to meet the timing accuracy in microsecond to sub-microsecond precision requirement over the air interface, O-DU clock needs to synchronize with the Grand Master Clock (GMC). The location of GMC and its connectivity to DU is out of scope of this specification. Please refer to Chapter 9 of [22] for details of S-plane (synchronization) aspects.
O-RAN fronthaul defines several timing distribution network topologies. IEEE1588 is used for O-RAN nodes timing synchronization protocol. GNSS based timing synchronization is another option for O-DU acquiring high accuracy timing. With GNSS based timing synchronization, first, the satellite timing messages are decoded by GNSS receiver, then the 1PPS output signal is generated. As described in O-RAN white box hardware reference specification, the 1PPS signal is connected with the PHC on fronthaul NIC. The O-DU is able to choose either IEEE1588 or GNSS synchronization method. Or it can use either one as primary timing synchronization source while keeping the other one as the backup. Here, a LinuxPTP based timing synchronization method is shown as an example. It may be used for O-DU to synchronize with GMC and distribute the clock to O-RU.
Figure -: O-DU Timing Synchronization
In Figure 7-7, first, O-DU syncs up backhaul NIC PHC with GMC; second, the system clock syncs up with backhaul PHC using PHC2Sys; then the O-DU software (fronthaul library) gets the system clock using Linux kernel function call. The fronthaul NIC PHC syncs up with system clock through PTP4L. The O-DU becomes boundary clock and is able to distribute the clock through front haul network to O-RU.
In case of loss of PTP sync in a vO-DU (Cloudified O-DU), the O-Cloud is notified using an event trigger as described in 7.2.3 of [38].
Accelerator Abstraction Layer (AAL)
In previous sections, the focus is on running a complete L1 layer data on general purpose processor. In certain use cases, a dedicated hardware is used along with host processor to fulfil specific requirements on latency, power efficiency, etc. The hardware accelerator can be implemented on many types of devices such as GPU, FPGA, or ASIC. The accelerator hardware is implementation dependent and is out of scope of this specification. Even so, it is necessary to define a standardized interface to hardware accelerator, which will make the software stack portable with different hardware platform. Based on the data processing flow, the hardware accelerators are categorized into two models: lookaside and inline. In the lookaside model, an accelerator is invoked by the L1 host application to offload designated functions; when acceleration functions are completed, the results are sent back to the host application. With the inline acceleration model, the host processor invokes the accelerator to offload the data processing work, however the result is not sent back to the host. The following figures illustrates L1 processing flow based on these two types of hardware acceleration models.
Lookaside accelerator processing flow
Figure -: Lookaside Accelerator Model
Inline accelerator processing flow
Figure -: Inline Accelerator Model
Figure 5.8 shows the lookaside acceleration model. For the uplink data processing, the host receives the data from O-RAN via fronthaul interface; for the downlink processing, the host processor receives the data from L2 via L1/L2 interface. When either uplink or downlink data needs to be processed by accelerator, the host processor handovers the workload to the accelerator; after the data processing is completed, the results are turn over to the host. Figure 5-9 shows the inline accelerator model. In this case, the accelerator directly receives the uplink data from O-RU via front haul interface. When the L1 process is completed, the result is sent to the host via AAL in order to continue the L2 processing. For the downlink process, the finished L2 data is sent to the accelerator via AAL for L1 processing. When the L1 downlink is completed, the results are sent to O-RU.
AAL Lookaside Profile
Lookaside FEC Profile
In general, any combination of L1 functions can be offload to the accelerator. In real deployment, only those functions take more computing power will be offloaded to the accelerator. The accelerator design is implementation specific. To better represent accelerator’s functional capabilities, AAL profile is used to differentiate the combination of accelerator architecture and functions. AAL lookaside profile indicates the accelerator adopted the lookaside processing model. The AAL lookaside processing flows are explained in the early section. During the L1 process, the host application initiates the offload work to accelerator, meanwhile the host may perform other work in parallel, it retrieves the result once the work is complete. The AAL FEC Profile includes both uplink and downlink function of PDSCH and PUSCH. The downlink functions are CRC Generation, LDPC Encoding, Rate Matching. The uplink functions are Rate De-matching, LDPC Decoder, CRC Check. These functions can be invoked sequentially or individually.

Massive MIMO Optimization
The Massive MIMO (mMIMO) technology is adopted to improve the wireless performance, coverage and the QoS. The beamforming method is the essential element of mMIMO which greatly affects the throughput of wireless network. To optimize the mMIMO beamforming, the non-RT and near-RT RIC utilize the UE/BS channel condition, mobility, and measured performance data to assisted beamforming mode selection. The Grid-of-Beam (GoB) [40] and non-Grid-of-Beam (non-GoB) [41] are two different approaches of beamforming methods that can be used in the O-RAN system [40]. In case of non-GoB, the beamforming weights are generated dynamically in real time instead of using predefined beam set. As O-RAN does not standardize the beamforming algorithm, there are many algorithms that vendors can chose for non-GoB BF weight calculate. The SRS based dynamic BF weight generation is commonly used for non-GoB beamforming weight calculation. There are many factors (SRS periodicity, channel estimation and BF weight calculation algorithms) will affect the effectiveness of non-GoB performance, and the combination of these factors corresponding a BF mode. Various non-GoB modes can be designed to meet the requirements of different UE locations and channel situations [42]. Figure 7-11 diagram describes the SRS based non-GoB operation flow.
Figure 7-11 Non-GoB mMIMO operation flow
When non-GoB is used, the L1 and L2 need to share the information entities such as BF mode configuration, UE performance measurement KPIs to facilitate the AI/ML model training and inference operations . The following information listed in the Table 7-2.
Table 7-2 L1/L2 Information Entities List
Fronthaul M-Plane Processing
The fronthaul M-plane is responsible for O-RU configuration management, performance management, software/file management, and fault management. NETCONF/Yang model is used for the fronthaul M-plane protocol. Refer to the WG4 Management Plane Specification for details.
Figure 7-12 Fronthaul M-Plane Processing
Figure 7-12 shows the fronthaul M-plane processing flow which includes the protocol processing, message parsing and preparation, and the M-plane message execution operation.
Energy Saving Processing
Energy saving (ES) is one of the key features of sustainable mobile network. The O-RAN energy saving function is achieved by utilizing the AI/ML technology to facilitate the ES operation. To optimize decision making, AI/ML model within Non-RT RIC/ Near-RT RIC predicts traffic, user mobility, and resource usage based on the RAN network status info and AI model. The non-RT RIC and near-RT RIC energy saving application determine the proper time to put the RAN operation in different energy saving modes and resume the normal operation when needed.  The following sections describes energy saving operations to fulfill different use case scenarios.
Energy Saving Feature Capability and Configuration
The O-RU reports energy saving capability, configurations to O-DU via M-plane during initialization. The capabilities include carrier deactivation for energy saving, TRX control module capabilities, ASM module capabilities, and energy saving capability common information. This information will be used by O-DU to setup the O-RU into proper energy saving state when it is required. The details of ES capabilities are described in the O-RAN fronthaul M-plane specification.
Cell/Carrier Power Control
When the mobile network traffic volume is low, it is possible for RAN to get into save energy mode by switching off carrier(s) or entire cell without impairing the user experience. The handover may be required before bringing down carrier or cell.
The cell/carrier power control is done via M-plane message and operation procedure is provided below.
Power Off Cell/Carrier:
•	The L1 function set the parameters energy-saving-enabled to “TRUE” and send M-plane message to O-RU
•	L1 receives Cell/Carrier power off command from L2
•	L1 set parameter [tr]x-array-carrier::deactive for correspond cell or carrier, and send the M-plane message to O-RU.
•	If the O-RU fails to change the cell/carriers power state, an error message is sent to O-DU by O-RU
Power On Cell/Carrier:
•	The L1 function set the parameters energy-saving-enabled to “TRUE” and send M-plane message to O-RU
•	L1 receives Cell/Carrier power off command from L2
•	L1 set parameter [tr]x-array-carrier:: active for correspond cell or carrier, and send the M-plane message to O-RU.
•	If the O-RU fails to power on the cell/carriers power state, an error message is sent to O-DU by O-RU
RF Channel Reconfiguration
In 5G mobile networks, when mMIMO is used to enhance the network performance on capacity, it requires more power for the RF channels. To create a green mobile network, during a low network traffic period, the O-RU can reduce the power consumption by switching off some Tx/Rx arrays. The RF Channel Reconfiguration operation procedure can be triggered by RIC xApp.
Before the RF Channel Reconfiguration can be performed, the O-DU gathers the O-RU supported antenna pattern via M-plane message, then the O-DU will send the TRX_CONTROL command to the O-RU to disable a set of the antenna arrays.
Figure 7-13 RF channel reconfiguration Processing
RF Reconfiguration Operation flow:
1.	Receives RF reconfiguration from RIC energy saving application.
2.	O-DU sends TRX control C-plane message with new antenna carrier pattern to O-RU.
3.	Case 1, step1: For defined sleep period case, the O-RU configures the antennas and disable certain designated antennas and set sleep timer for specified period time at sleep start time.
4.	Case 1, step2: O-RU will wake up and resume to normal operation state after sleep period.
5.	Case 1, step3: O-RU may send Ack/Nack message to O-DU if the TRX message includes request for Ack/Nack.
6.	Case 2, step1: For undefined sleep period case, the O-RU configures the antennas and disable certain designated antennas and enter sleep state at sleep start time.
7.	Case 2, step2: O-RU receives second TRX control C-plane message with a set of antennas pattern.
8.	Case 2, step3: O-RU set the antenna pattern and enable specified antennas.
Advanced Sleep Mode
This energy saving feature is based on the capability of the O-RU. During system initialization phase, the O-RU reports its capable of supporting the ASM feature, which includes the number of sleep modes. Based on the policy and trained model, when the network traffic is low, RIC ES app can put the RAN into different level of sleep mode. The O-DU will take action to put the O-RU into sleep mode after receiving instruction from Near-RT RIC xApp.
the Advanced Sleep Mode operation processing flow show in Figure 7-14.

7.	Case 2, step 2: O-RU receives second ASM control C-plane message to wake up O-RU.
8.	Case 2, step 3: O-RU wake up.
DMRS-BF
DMRS-based beamforming uses DMRS to calculate beamforming weights in the O-RU. The O-DU provides DMRS configurations of UEs/UE group to the O-RU. Upon receiving I/Q data via air interface, the O-RU uses DMRS for channel estimation, computes beamforming weights, and applies them to both PUSCH and DMRS data. This technique dynamically adjusts beam direction based on frequent DMRS updates, making it ideal for high mobility environments. It may also complete the equalization process within O-RU.
This method excels in tracking fast-moving UEs, ensuring stable, high-quality connections. By focusing energy on the UE, it improves signal quality, reduces interference, increases system capacity, and optimizes energy use. Thus, DMRS-based beamforming enhances network performance, supports high mobility, and optimizes signal direction for better efficiency and connectivity.
DMRS-BF Initialization
The initialization process for DMRS-based beamforming begins by obtaining the DMRS-BF configuration information via the M-plane. Once the configuration is retrieved, the system checks whether DMRS-BF-EQ or DMRS-BF-NEQ is supported by both the O-DU and O-RU. If any one type of DMRS-BF is supported, the O-DU and O-RU are initialized accordingly, enabling channel estimation and beamforming based on the DMRS data. However, if DMRS-BF is not supported by either unit, the system automatically configures an alternative beamforming method, such as SRS-based or codebook-based beamforming, provided those methods are supported. This ensures that even in the absence of DMRS-BF capabilities, the system can still achieve optimized beamforming through other available techniques.
Figure 7-15 DMRS-BF Initialization Process
DMRS-BF Operation
In DMRS-based beamforming, the O-RU begins by collecting I/Q data from the antennas, which records both the amplitude and phase of the signal. The DMRS is then used to estimate channel conditions using various techniques and calculate beamforming weights. The details of techniques used in channel estimation and weights calculation are beyond the scope of this specification. These weights are applied to the I/Q data to improve signal quality by enhancing its directionality and reducing interference. This involves adjusting the phase and amplitude of signals from each antenna for optimal beamforming.
In the follow-on processing of O-DU, it may be desired to receive certain symbols first, so I would better process the data, e.g, receiving the DMRS signal for channel estimation. If necessary, the O-RU reorders the beamformed data to match the O-DU’s data transmission requirements, as defined during initialization, ensuring seamless data handling. The processed PUSCH data is then transmitted to the O-DU over the fronthaul interface.
When the O-DU receives the data, it reassembles it if it had been reordered by the O-RU. Using the DMRS data, the O-DU performs channel estimation, determining how the channel has affected the signal. Equalization weights are then calculated and applied to the PUSCH data to correct any signal distortions caused by the channel.
After applying these equalization adjustments, the PUSCH data moves through further processing stages like decoding and error correction, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the uplink transmission.
Figure 7-16 PUSCH DMRS-BF Processing
RRM and SINR Measurement
To make optimal decisions regarding resource allocation, interference management, and ensuring quality of service, the O-DU requires specific Radio Resource Management (RRM) measurements based on signals prior to beamforming and equalization. However, these measurements are typically not available directly at the O-DU when using the DMRS-BF option. Instead, the O-RU is responsible for conducting these RRM measurements and transmitting the data to the O-DU for further analysis and decision-making.
During the system initialization phase, the O-RU announces its supported RRM measurements, which allows the O-DU to configure the required measurements through an M-plane configuration message. It is important to note that different RRM measurements may have varying reporting frequencies. Additionally, the requirements for RRM measurements may differ depending on whether DMRS-BF-EQ or DMRS-BF-NEQ is being used. For example, in the case of DMRS-BF-NEQ, the O-RU may modify a UE layer's time or frequency offset due to its beamforming operations. In such cases, the O-RU must declare that these parameters remain unaffected by its processing. For O-RUs supporting DMRS-BF-NEQ, RRM measurements related to DMRS-BF are optional, but may be provided if the O-RU declares this capability.
The O-RU conveys the RRM measurements to the O-DU via C-Plane messages, sending them on a slot-by-slot basis for every slot in which DMRS-BF is utilized. If supported and configured by the O-DU, the O-RU may send RRM measurements multiple times per slot to ensure accurate and timely data delivery for resource management and system optimization.
Figure 7-17 RRM Measurement and SINR Processing
The O-DU uses post-equalization SINR to adjust link adaptation and the throughput capacity of the channel. Higher SINR values allow for the use of higher-order modulation schemes. In the case of DMRS-BF-EQ, the SINR calculation is completed by the O-RU. To initiate and configure SINR reporting, the O-DU first checks whether DMRS-BF-EQ is being used and if DMRS symbols are not being sent to the O-DU. When the O-RU’s RX endpoint is configured for DMRS-BF-EQ and does not send DMRS symbols, or if the O-RU supports the simultaneous transmission of both DMRS symbols and SINR data, the O-DU can facilitate SINR reporting. The O-DU then configures the SINR reporting time and frequency parameters, according to the O-RU’s reported capabilities.
Based on the SINR report configuration, the O-RU sends SINR to O-DU in C-plane messages. If O-DU-controlled frequency resolution is supported, the O-DU configures the frequency resolution, and the O-RU confirms it for SINR reporting. Also, the O-RU selects specified symbols to be included in the SINR reports.
An endpoint that supports DMRS-BF-EQ must be capable of providing at least one SINR value per PRB per slot. This ensures that the necessary SINR information is reported correctly for each resource block and slot combination, contributing to effective resource management and system performance.
Shared O-RU
Shared O-RU allows multiple O-DU nodes to share a single O-RU, offering benefits such as resiliency, load balancing, and network sharing. In single-MNO (Mobile Network Operator) use case, it enhances network resiliency and load balancing. Additionally, shared O-RU supports BBU pooling and RAN sharing, influencing fronthaul operations. It also facilitates multi-vendor network slicing with dynamic resource allocation, demonstrating its versatility across different deployment scenarios. These advantages ensure efficient resource utilization and robust network performance.
For single-operator deployments, the decomposition of the RAN into O-RU and O-DU components, based on O-RAN front haul interfaces, enhances system delivery. This includes increased availability, scalability, and support for combined LTE and NR deployments. The shared O-RU architecture also enables the integration of O-DUs from multiple vendors, with dynamic radio resource allocation across O-DUs/slices.
For multi-operator deployments, shared O-RU facilitates RAN resource sharing, ensuring efficient use of network infrastructure. Specifically:
- Each operator utilizes shared O-RU resources while maintaining a dedicated O-DU node.
- A common O-RU is shared, with either pre-allocated or dynamically allocated resources among operators.
- In a shared O-RU architecture, the host operator manages the Shared O-RU, integrating it with the O-DUs of multiple tenant operators.
- The host can also act as a neutral host, sharing the O-RU among tenant operators.
- This approach, coupled with open fronthaul shared cell functionality, addresses various deployment requirements.
The following figure illustrates both shared O-RU deployment architectures.
Figure 7-18 Shared O-RU Architecture
Since the requirements for control-plane and data-plane in a shared O-RU are no difference than non-sharing case, existing fronthaul C-Plane/U-Plane messages can be used to transmit uplink and downlink IQ data.
Regarding timing synchronization, the fronthaul S-Plane requirements must be fulfilled. The Shared O-RU Host has the flexibility to configure synchronization settings and select a synchronization source. Additionally, the Shared O-RU host can choose multiple sync sources, including one from its own O-DU and another from an SRO’s O-DU.
O-DU L2 Functional Blocks
Figure 8-1 illustrates the L2 functional blocks of O-DU as a reference design. An implementation may specify the modules differently.

F1 User Plane interface handling modules: It consists of tasks related to Tunnel management, DL and UL Data and Downlink flow control. It does tasks defined in 3GPP TS 29.281 [2] and TS 38.425 [15].
Data Plane Application: Handles DL Data packets received within 3GPP TS 29.281 [2] defined NR RAN Container and performs UL Data packet transmission for packets received from RLC. This Application invokes eGTPU encapsulation/decapsulation functionality for eGTPU header processing.
eGTPU encaps/decaps: This functional block performs eGTPU header decapsulation and processing in DL and eGTPU header encapsulation for the UL packets at F1-U.
Downlink Flow Control: Downlink Data Delivery Status generation with feedback received from RLC.
RLC Protocol modules: These modules handle processing related to SRB and DRB plane. It does tasks defined in 3GPP TS 38.322 [8]. RLC uses the logical channel for data transfer.

L2 MAC Scheduler
Figure 8-2 illustrates the MAC scheduler components present in O-DU architecture. It is assumed that the DU includes complete MAC and scheduler functions implemented in the same physical platform.
Figure 8-2 L2 MAC scheduler components
NR Scheduler functional block has been further expanded into indicative smaller functional sub-blocks to capture the scheduler functionality.
Note: An actual implementation may divide the scheduler into functional sub-blocks differently.
DL/UL Resource Scheduler: This corresponds to functionality of time-domain and frequency domain scheduling in DL and UL, respectively. Resource scheduling is performed per scheduling period and may be performed for a single slot or multiple slots. Massive MIMO focuses on beamforming for capacity enhancement with full digital array structure for frequency<6GHz and hybrid/analog architecture for frequency >6GHz. It is also feasible to have single beam approach for low carrier frequency, however multi-beam approach is desirable for higher carrier frequency.   It may include functions such as beam selection, selecting of UEs and associated bearers per scheduling period, allocation of radio resources for PDCCH, PUSCH, PDSCH and associated channels like DMRS. The beam selection is based on various beamforming method supported in the gNB system. In the case of predefined beamforming method, an index called “beamId” indicates the specific beam pre-defined in the O-RU to use in case of hybrid architecture. However, in case of Hierarchical architecture, the beam indices are pre-defined in the O-DU as defined by O-RAN Fronthaul M-Plane specification [21]. The beam selection function selects beam indices “beamId” that is applied to DL or UL data. In the case of dynamic beamforming, the beamforming weights are given to be applied as defined in the O-RAN Fronthaul CUS Plane specification [20]. It may also include functions/algorithm to support slice differentiation as specified by RRMpolicy for the resource type (PRB) so as to meet the specific SLA. It may also include the slice metric so as to prioritize the specific slice scheduling in a particular TTI that enables the gNB DU system to meet the slice level agreement.
DL/UL Link Adaptation (LA): This functionality performs per UE Link Adaptation in DL and UL, respectively. Link Adaptation may be performed based on channel quality reported by UE or estimated at gNB corrected by BLER. LA would return effective MCS to be used for channel allocation to the UE.
UL Tx Power Control: Performs Closed loop UL power control for PUSCH, SRS and PUCCH. It may estimate the UL Tx power based on UE feedback (e.g.: Power Headroom Report) or measured UL channels.
DL/UL MIMO Mode Control: Determines per UE the MIMO mode, in DL and UL, respectively, to be used along with the corresponding precoding matrix.
TA Manager: Estimating the TA Command for UE based on feedback from L1 using PUSCH, PUCCH and SRS.
Performance metrics (Capacity, throughput etc.) will be dependent on software implementation and underlying hardware.
Supporting E2 service models
E2 service models are supported as per call flows as per specifications from O-RAN WG5. Each service model enables a use case across O-RAN nodes. The following generic design in O-DU and O-CU supports any service model with report/insert/control/policy services with the neat real-time RIC.
Figure 8-3 E2 service model support in O-DU
When an E2 message is received at O-DU, the E2 handler module interacts with SM (Service Model) Fanout module to deliver the messages to internal module related to the service model. The SM fanout module consults the SM catalog module and finds the SM specific modules and APIs to be invoked the SM-Service-API-Table module contains maps the following:
SM service, E2 messages corresponding
Receiver module(s) for each E2 message and the message contents to be relayed
When the O-DU sends an E2 message, it is sent through the E2 Sender module which consults SM Catalog module and maps the respective E2 message API. The E2 sender uses KPIs in KPI module when KPIs are reported in an E2 message.

eGTPu encaps and decaps: It handles the eGTPu protocol stack. It performs eGTPu encapsulation and decapsulation as described in 3GPP TS 29.281 [2] and TS 38.425 [15].
Data Application: This function receives the data packet from UPF, peer O-CU and O-DU over eGTPu interface. It calls eGTPu encaps and decaps to remove the eGTPu header. It identifies the corresponding UE and DRB Id based on mapping of TEID and IP address maintained at eGTPu. It then forwards the data packet to SDAP, which maps the PDU Session to appropriate DRB and passes data to NR PDCP along with information of UE and DRB Id. While sending packet to NR PDCP, it also indicates from which interface this packet has been received, i.e., from UPF or from peer O-CU or from O-DU.
Data Application also processes the data packets received from SDAP. On receiving data packet, it adds the eGTPu header by calling eGTPu encaps and decaps. On the basis of destination, UE and DRB Id received from NR PDCP, packet relay fetches the TEID and IP address from the mapping maintained at eGTPu and sends the data packet to the destination provided by NR PDCP.

MAC – Scheduler Interface
5G NR MAC and scheduler modules interact via well-defined APIs. The APIs ensure any scheduler implementation interworks with MAC. This ensures the freedom of choice for OEMs and operators to plug in a scheduler implementation of choice from a third-party vendor in O-DU.
The functionalities of  the scheduler module are restricted to optimal allocation of radio resources at every TTI while catering to the need of gNB for transmission of:
UE specific UL/DL data and signalling messages and
broadcast messages
To achieve the above objective, the APIs defined below abstract the scheduler of any protocol specific operations like handling payloads. The interfaces shown below and the APIs may evolve/change further in future releases of this document to achieve a more optimized scheduler implementation.
Figure 11-13 MAC-Scheduler interface
The MAC-Scheduler interface includes the slice related information (sNSSAI) associated with the logical channel, that helps the scheduler in multiplexing of MAC SDUs from one or different logical channel onto transport blocks (TB) to be delivered to the physical layer on transport channels. The slice id/sNSSAI associated with the logical channel and its slice priority (defined by the operator) derives a slice metric in the PF scheduler to do logical channel prioritization and radio resource selection so as to meet the slice SLA.
The following tables detail the interactions between MAC and scheduler both for configuration and data transfer operations.

For the full description of energy savings using ASM or TRX control, please refer to [22].

The NES interface related information is divided into four categories:  NES Configuration and Capability Information, NES RAN Performance Data, NES Operation Control, and NES Operation Status Info. The details of NES information are described in the following tables.
Table - NES Configuration and Capability Info
Table - NES RAN Performance Data
Table - NES Operation Control
Table - NES Operation Status Information
O-CU/O-DU Energy Optimization
In the early discussion, most of the energy saving measurements focused on the radio related operation which is the major energy consumption unit. To further achieve the green network goal, more measures can be taken on O-CU aand O-DU to reduce a significant portion of RAN energy cost while maintaining the wireless network performance.
Efficient power management in O-CU/O-DU systems is essential for cost reduction and environmental sustainability. The following approaches are considered to optimize RAN system power utilization:
For CPU power management, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a technique to adjust CPU voltage and clock frequency dynamically based on workload. Lower frequencies during idle periods save power with optimal task allocation to cores, minimizing context switches and maximizing CPU utilization.
On Memory Power Optimization, adjusting memory clock speeds based on workload, results in power savins. It is also possible to limit memory bandwidth during low-demand periods to reduce power consumption.
For the system thermal control, adjusting fan speed based on system (include CPU and memory) temperatures. Overcooling wastes energy if it is not based on thermals condition. Turning off or reducing fan speed during low-load periods save energy.
In summary, a holistic approach that combines CPU power management, memory optimization, and intelligent fan control ensures energy-efficient O-CU/O-DU systems while maintaining performance and reliability.
O-CU/O-DU Power Management Architecture
O-CU/O-DU power management architecture can be significantly enhanced by employing a centralized power manager that makes dynamic decisions based on power-saving policies, workload demands, and CPU utilization. This intelligent power manager continuously monitors the server's performance metrics and adjusts the operational states of the CPU and its cores accordingly, scaling down during low demand periods to conserve energy or ramping up during peak times to ensure performance. By applying power-saving policies, it can selectively idle or shut down underutilized cores, thus optimizing CPU power usage. Additionally, the power manager oversees memory power consumption by regulating memory frequency and voltage based on current workload requirements, ensuring that energy is not wasted on idle memory resources. Cooling fans are also controlled adaptively; their speeds are adjusted in real-time according to the thermal conditions, preventing unnecessary energy expenditure while maintaining optimal cooling. This power management architecture not only improves energy efficiency but also maintains the balance between performance and power consumption, leading to cost savings and a reduced environmental footprint for overall RAN system.
The O-CU/O-DU power management architecture is described in Figure 13-10. The architecture leverages the commercial off the shelf processor and memory devices to achieve the best performance with lower power consumption.
Figure - O-CU/O-DU Power Control Architecture
O-CU/O-DU Demand Based Power Management Flow
Demand-based power management flow involves a continuous assessment of the O-CU/O-DU’s workload and CPU utilization to dynamically adjust power usage for optimal efficiency. The process begins with real-time monitoring of workload demands and CPU activity levels. When the workload is low or CPU utilization drops, the power management system triggers adjustments to the Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) voltage, lowering it to decrease power consumption. In tandem, the CPU clock speed may be reduced to further conserve energy, aligning processing power with the current demand. This dual adjustment not only minimizes unnecessary power usage but also reduces heat generation, alleviating the load on cooling systems and contributing to overall energy savings. By fine-tuning these parameters on-the-fly, the RAN system can achieve a balance between maintaining performance standards and reducing power consumption, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and prolonging hardware lifespan.
Figure 13-11 shows the demand-based power management flow. the power control software may adjust CPU voltage and clock frequency dynamically based on workload.
Figure - Demand Based Power Management Flow
CPU Turbo Mode is a feature found in modern processors that dynamically adjusts the clock speed of individual cores to enhance performance. It allows a processor core to temporarily exceed its base clock frequency when certain conditions are met (such as power and thermal headroom). When using turbo mode, the intention is fine-tuning for specific applications that benefit from higher clock speeds on certain cores; it can improve performance in workloads that don’t utilize all cores equally.
Utilizing CPU C-states for power saving involves strategically transitioning the CPU into various low-power idle states when full performance is not needed. Each C-state represents a deeper level of power reduction, with C0 being the fully operational state and deeper states (C1, C2, C3, etc.) progressively reducing power consumption by shutting down more components. The transition into these states is based on workload conditions and CPU activity; when the CPU is idle, it can enter a deeper C-state to save energy. However, there are conditions and restrictions to consider, such as the wake-up time, which is the time required for the CPU to return to an active state (C0) from a deeper C-state. Deeper C-states save more power but have longer wake-up times, which can affect performance if the CPU needs to quickly resume full activity. Thus, the power management system must balance the energy savings with the potential impact on responsiveness, ensuring that deeper C-states are used during extended idle periods while lighter states are used for shorter idles to maintain a responsive system. This careful management helps maximize power efficiency without compromising the performance demands of active workloads.
L1/L2 Collaboration on Power Management
In a RAN network, the interaction between the physical layer (L1) and the medium access control layer (L2) plays a crucial role in power saving strategies, especially based on varying workloads such as user numbers and time of day. The physical layer is responsible for the actual transmission and reception of data over the air interface, while the MAC layer handles the scheduling and management of these transmissions.
Interaction between L1 and L2 for Power Saving
1.	Monitoring and Reporting: The physical layer continuously monitors real-time network conditions, including the channel condition, reference signal quality. This information is periodically reported to the MAC layer.
2.	Dynamic Scheduling: The MAC layer, using the data from L1, dynamically schedules resource allocation. During periods of low demand (e.g., fewer users or off-peak hours), the MAC layer can reduce the number of active physical resource blocks (PRBs), thereby instructing L1 to lower transmission power or deactivate certain components temporarily.
3.	Sleep Modes and Deactivation: The MAC layer can instruct the physical layer to enter various sleep modes during periods of inactivity. For example, during nighttime or off-peak hours, the MAC scheduler can consolidate traffic to fewer base stations, allowing other base stations to enter deep sleep states, significantly saving power.
5.	Wake-Up Mechanisms: To ensure a balance between power saving and performance, the physical layer must be equipped with fast wake-up mechanisms. The predictive algorithms to anticipate traffic surges based on historical data (e.g., increased user activity during specific times of the day) and can pre-emptively bring components out of sleep modes in preparation for higher loads.
6.	Load Balancing: The MAC layer also performs load balancing by reallocating resources among cells based on real-time demand. By shifting the load to cells with more efficient power states or less congestion, the MAC layer can optimize overall power usage across the network.
By closely coordinating the activities between L1 and L2 based on real-time workload and user activity patterns, 5G networks can achieve significant power savings while maintaining the necessary quality of service. This dynamic and adaptive approach ensures that power usage is minimized during low-demand periods without compromising performance during high-demand times.
DMRS Beamforming
The O-DU performs configuration of O-RU if  DMRS beamforming is supported by O-DU and O-RU. The configuration parameters are described in [23]. In addition the O_DU processes the RRM and SINR measurements sent by O-RU. The processing of these measurement in O-DU MAC and scheduler and any algorithms used are implementation dependent.
