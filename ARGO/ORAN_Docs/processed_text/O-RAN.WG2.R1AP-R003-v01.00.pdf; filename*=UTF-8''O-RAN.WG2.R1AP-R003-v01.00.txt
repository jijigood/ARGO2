O-RAN.WG2.R1AP-R003-v01.00
4 Application protocol for the R1 services
4.1 Introduction
The present document contains a realization for the procedures identified in R1GAP [5]. It is based on
transport protocols as defined in R1TP [7]. This definition of the R1 Application Protocols (R1AP) defined in
the present document is based on the 3GPP service framework for network functions specified in 3GPP TS
29.501 [1] .
4.2 Version convetions for the present document
The version number of the present document follows the "major.minor" versioning scheme. There could be
implications for the interoperability between rApps and R1 service API implementations in SMO/Non-RT
RIC framework that are based on different versions of this specification.
An incremented "major" version field of the present document could indicate that a new major feature
(e.g., a new R1 service) has been added or that an incompatible change has been made to one or more R1
service APIs. An incremented "minor" version field could indicate that an optional feature has been added,
a technical issue has been fixed, or that clarifications or editorial corrections have been made.
There are separate version conventions defined for the RESTful R1 service APIs (see clause 5.2) and for the
related Open API documents (see Annex A).
5 RESTful R1 service APIs
5.1 Overview
The present document defines the protocol for the following R1 services interfaces in the form of  RESTful
Application Programming Interface (API) specifications, as listed in table 5.1-1
Table 5.1-1: RESTful R1 service APIs and their versions defined in the present document
Service Group Service API API version Open API Version
Service management and exposure Service registration  0.0.0 -
Service management and exposure Service discovery  0.0.0 -

The design of the above APIs is based on the procedures and requirements defined in R1UCR [6] and R1GAP
[5].
This definition of the RESTful R1 service APIs is based on the 3GPP service framework specified in 3GPP TS
29.501 [1] .
5.2 URI structure and supported content formats
This clause specifies the URI prefix and the supported formats applicable to the RESTful R1 service APIs.
All resource URIs of the APIs shall have the following prefix, except the "API versions" resource which shall
follow the rules specified in clause 9.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4]:

________________________________________________________________________________________________
© 2023 by the O-RAN ALLIANCE e.V. Your use is subject to the copyright statement on the cover page of this specification. 7
O-RAN.WG2.R1AP-R003-v01.00
 {apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API service consumer towards the API service producer
shall have the resource URI structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] , i.e.:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>
with the following components:
- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] ; however,  the
restrictions w.r.t the operator specific FQDN of the host portion defined there do not apply.
- The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. It is defined
in the clause specifying the corresponding RESTful R1 service API.
- The <apiMajorVersion> indicates the major version of the API and is defined in the
clause specifying the corresponding RESTful R1 serviceAPI.
- Each <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> represent a specific resource of the API. It is defined in the
corresponding RESTful R1 service API for each one of the defined resources.
For HTTP requests and responses that have message content, the content format JSON (see IETF RFC 8259
[12]) shall be supported. The JSON format shall be signalled by the content type "application/json".
All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [8]. An
implementation that dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of
path segments that are separated by "/", query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the
character set that is allowed by IETF
RFC 3986 [8] for these parts.
5.3 General considerations for RESTful R1 service APIs
5.3.1 Usage of HTTP header fields
HTTP headers are components of the headers section of the HTTP request and response messages. The
usage of HTTP header fields shall follow the definitions in clause 4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
5.3.2 Handling of large query results
The handling of large query results shall be supported by RESTful R1 service APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2
of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
5.3.3 Error reporting
In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is
generally not enough to discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error
information is typically delivered.
The RESTful R1 service APIs shall support the error reporting as specified in clause 6 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013
[4].

NOTE: ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such
reference is provided "RESTful R1 service API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of
the present document.
If an HTTP method is not defined for a particular resource in the present document, that method is not
supported. When that method is requested on the resource, the API producer shall return a "405 Method
Not Allowed" response as defined in clause 6.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
6 Service management and exposure services
6.1 Service registration API
6.1.1 Usage of HTTP header fields
This API allows the API producer to manage service registrations based on the procedures for “Registration
of services” defined in R1GAP [5].
6.1.2 API version
For the service registration API as specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be 0,
the MINOR version field shall be 0 and the PATCH version field shall be 0 (see clause 9.1 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL
013 [4] for a definition of the version fields). Consequently, the <apiMajorVersion> URI variable shall be set
to "v0".
6.1.3 Resource structure and methods
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API consumer towards the API producer shall have the
resource URI structure as defined in clause 5.2. The <apiName> resource URI variable shall be
"serviceregistration". The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> for each resource shall be set as described in clause
6.1.5.
Figure 6.1.3-1 shows the overall resource URI structure defined for the service registration API.

Figure 6.1.3-1: Resource URI structure of the service registration API
Table 6.1.3-1 lists the individual resources defined for the API, the applicable HTTP methods and the
associated service operations.

Figure 6.1.4.1.1-1: Register service API operation
The service operation is as follows:
1) The API Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the API Producer that includes the rApp
identifier and the service profile defining the service to be registered. The API Producer shall
process the service registration details received in the HTTP POST message and determine if the
request sent by the API Consumer is authorized or not.
2)  The API Producer shall return the HTTP POST response. On success "201 Created" is returned. The
message body carries the registered service profile and the "Location" HTTP header is present and
shall carry the URI for the newly created service resource including the service API identifier
generated by the API producer. On failure, the appropriate error code shall be returned, and the
message response body may contain additional error information.

Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specifications
A.1 General
This Annex formally specifies the RESTful R1 services APIs by defining OpenAPI documents in YAML format
that comply with the OpenAPI 3.0.0 Specification [4].
A.1.1 Versioning of OpenAPI specifications for the RESTful R1 service APIs
The Open API specifications of the RESTful R1 service APIs provided in this annex are versioned by Semantic
Versioning 2.0.0 [11] as defined in the OpenAPI Specification [4]. When included in the present
specification, the OpenAPI documents are considered as released and are versioned using three numbers
major.minor.patch and optional build metadata  where the main compatibility expectations stated for
Sematic Versioning [11] imply:
1) The "major" version field is stepped up when incompatible API changes are made to the
OpenAPI document. The "major" version in the OpenAPI document corresponds to the major
API version in the resource URIs for of the RESTful R1 APIs defined in clause 5.
2) The "minor" version field is stepped up when features are added to the OpenAPI document in a
way that keeps implementations compatible even if not all added features are not supported by
both the service producer and the service consumer of the R1 service.
3) The "patch" version is stepped up when errors are corrected in a backward compatible way.
4) When applicable, build metadata are used to represent editorial changes to the OpenAPI
document, i.e., changes that have no technical impact. According to Semantic Versioning [11],
build metadata are denoted by appending a plus ("+") sign followed by an integral number that
is increment at every version that includes only the editorial changes, e.g 1.0.0+0, 1.0.0+1 etc.
NOTE: rApps and SMO/Non-RT RIC framework implementations may support multiple API versions of
an R1 service.
