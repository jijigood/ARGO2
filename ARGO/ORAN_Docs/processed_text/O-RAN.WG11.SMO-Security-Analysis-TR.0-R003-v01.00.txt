Introduction
Scope
This technical report provides the threat model and risk assessment for the SMO.  The report identifies threats and risks and recommends potential security controls to protect against those threats through safeguards or mitigation.
The steps of the threat modelling process are as follows:
Identify assets: Identify the assets of the SMO that must be protected.
Identify threats: Identify the threats that could adversely impact the SMO and threats that can use the SMO to adversely impact other components of the O-RAN system.
Identify the attack surface and attack vectors: Identify the points in the SMO where an attacker could
gain entry to the SMO
gain entry to another O-RAN system through the SMO
exploit a vulnerability or misconfiguration
compromise the system or its data.
Measure risk: The extent to which confidentiality, integrity, or availability is threatened, based upon a risk-based analysis considering the impact level resulting from an attack and the likelihood of occurrence.
Recommend controls: The management, operational, and technical controls for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the SMO and its information.
Considerations
This Technical Report makes the following considerations:
The attack surface of the SMO includes its interfaces, functions, and data.  Data-at-rest, Data-in-motion, and Data-in-use must be considered.
O-RAN Alliance WG1 is in the process of defining an architecture for a decoupled SMO.  This will influence the set assets to be protected.
The O-RAN Alliance is pursuing a zero-trust architecture (ZTA) for its specifications based upon NIST SP 800-207 [8].  This will affect the risk scoring.
Security controls are recommended for specifications of the SMO.  The recommended controls provided in this report will be shared with the responsible O-RAN Alliance working group, such as WG1 and WG10, so that the appropriate specification relevant to the recommendation can be updated.
Some of the identified SMO assets may already be in scope for separate ongoing SFG security work items.  The SMO security Technical Report work item may inform those work items.

Definitions and Abbreviations
Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions provided in O-RAN.WG1.O-RAN-Architecture-Description-v06.00 apply:
A1: Interface between non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC to enable policy-driven guidance of Near-RT RIC applications/functions, and support AI/ML workflow.
Near-RT RIC: O-RAN Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller: A logical function that enables near-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained data collection and actions over E2 interface. It may include AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning) workflow including model training, inference and updates.
Non-RT RIC: O-RAN Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller: A logical function within SMO that drives the content carried across the A1 interface.  It is comprised of the Non-RT RIC Framework and the Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps) whose functions are defined below.
Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps): Modular applications that leverage the functionality exposed via the Non-RT RIC Framework’s R1 interface to provide added value services relative to RAN operation, such as driving the A1 interface, recommending values and actions that may be subsequently applied over the O1/O2 interface and generating “enrichment information” for the use of other rApps.  The rApp functionality within the Non-RT RIC enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources and policy-based guidance to the applications/features in Near-RT RIC.
Non-RT RIC Framework: That functionality internal to the SMO that logically terminates the A1 interface to the Near-RT RIC and exposes to rApps, via its R1 interface, the set of internal SMO services needed for their runtime processing.  The Non-RT RIC Framework functionality within the Non-RT RIC provides AI/ML workflow including model training, inference and updates needed for rApps.
R1 Interface: Interface between rApps and Non-RT RIC Framework via which R1 Services can be produced and consumed.
R1 Services: A collection of services including, but not limited to, service registration and discovery services, authentication and authorization services, AI/ML workflow services, and A1, O1 and O2 related services.

Terms
This document uses the verbal forms for the expression of provisions as defined in .
This document uses the term Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as defined by US NIST in [8] and applied to 5G cloud deployments by US CISA in [9].
A ZTA provides protection from external and internal threats, assuming the following:
there is no implicit trust granted to an asset based upon ownership, physical location, or network location [8]
the adversary is already inside the network. Perimeter defenses are no longer sufficient to secure a network, and there should always be an assumption that a threat actor has established a foothold in the network [9]
This document uses the term “attack surface” defined by US NIST as
The set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from, that system, system element, or environment [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/attack_surface]
This document refers to “sensitive information” defined by US NIST as
information whose loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or modification could adversely affect security [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/sensitive]
SMO Assets
Architecture
There are security risks with the SMO due to its internal functions and internal and external interfaces. Securing the SMO is imperative because it is responsible for all service management and orchestration. A security vulnerability within the SMO could be exploited to serve as an entry point for attacks against O-RAN components and lateral movement across O-RAN.
Figure 2.1-1 and Figure 2.1-2 show the service-based architectural view of the SMO including internal and external interfaces and the Non-RT-RIC.  The Attack Surface of the SMO includes Functions, Interfaces, and Information, which each have assets that should be protected. Figure 2.1-3 is the SMO security architecture, based upon the other two figures, showing the SMO attack surface with the following assets to be protected:
SMO Framework and Functions
Non-RT RIC
SMO internal communications
O1, O2, R1 and A1 interfaces

Threats
Threat Model
For identifying threats, we are using STRIDE:
S - Spoofing identity. An application or program can masquerade as another to gain advantages not typically allowed for that program.
T - Tampering with data. This involves the malicious modification of data, including making unauthorized changes to a database and alteration of data as it flows between computers.
R - Repudiation. A user or program refuses the authenticity of a good or reasonable command or action.
I - Information disclosure. This involves the exposure of information to individuals with unauthorized access to it. For example, users gain the ability to read a file that they normally would not have been granted access to, or an intruder can read data in transit between computers.
D - Denial of service. These attacks deny service to valid users, such as making a website unavailable or unusable by flooding it with illegitimate requests to keep legitimate users without access.
E - Elevation of privileges. An unauthorized user gains privileged rights to access previously no granted to compromise or destroy the system, such as a change in membership.

Risk Assessment
This section provides risk assessment tables for each of the identified assets.  These tables list the assets, threats, impacts, and possible security controls.
A malicious actor may be a nation-state adversary, cybercriminal, or employee.  In a ZTA, perimeter defenses alone are insufficient.  The SMO must be protected from untrusted external sources attempting to have access, while also assuming internal threat actors are inside the network with access to its functions and data.  Security controls for a ZTA, protecting against external and internal threats, should be implemented through a risk-based approach.  A risk analysis calculates risk levels by assessing the threat’s Likelihood of attack and the Impact from the attack.
Impact scores can be lowered with consideration of existing security controls.  Impact scoring is based upon current security controls.  Impact scoring does not consider security controls that may be potentially specified in the future.
Likelihood scores may be higher when the goal is a ZTA, because external and internal threats must be considered.  When likelihood scoring during a risk analysis, it is necessary to consider internal threats performing reconnaissance attacks impacting confidentiality and privacy and attacks causing damage or degrading performance impacting availability.  Internal threat actors are less likely to perform damaging attacks that are quickly and easily detected and blocked, but more likely to attempt reconnaissance attacks to collect information.  As a result, reconnaissance type attacks can be scored Likelihood = High while damaging/availability attacks can be scored Likelihood = Medium or Low.
External and internal threats are from the perspective of the SMO.  External Threats are external to the SMO and Internal Threats are internal the SMO. An External Threat may be external to the SMO but internal to the O-RAN architecture.
A risk analysis of SMO threats is provided in the tables below covering general SMO risks, risks to the O2 interface, and risks to External interfaces.
Threats and risks to the A1 and R1 interfaces are assessed in a separate Technical Report, Study on Security for Non-RT-RIC [20].
Additional SMO threats may be added for Decoupled SMO and Shared O-RU.

Primary Security Issues
The following items were identified during the SMO Security Analysis phase 1 and are addressed in this TR v1:
External interfaces to the SMO and Non-RT RIC have risks of exploitation from external threat actors.  The protocol and API used on an external interface is defined by the application or service and is not in-scope for the O-RAN Alliance.  WG11 analyzed the threats, risks, and potential security controls with the goal to provide general security requirements for any implementation of an External interface with the goal to protect O-RAN network functions and data.
The O2 interface is at risk of being exploited by an internal threat actor at the SMO or the O-Cloud.  This TR provides a security analysis of the O2 interface from the perspectives of the internal threat actor at the SMO and the O-Cloud, in addition to external threats.  The work item team will need to collaborate with the O-Cloud security work item team to ensure complete coverage of O2 threats and security controls.
The following items were identified as SMO security topics that will require a second phase of the SMO Security Analysis to produce TR v2.
SMO Internal Communications may be implemented as a bus or direct communication. WG11 will need to form general security requirements for both implementations.
WG11 should contribute security requirements during efforts to develop specifications for a Decoupled SMO.  A second phase of the SMO Security Analysis TR will need to be performed to address the Decoupled SMO architecture defined in WG1.
WG11 should contribute security requirements during efforts to develop specifications for Shared O-RU.  A second phase of the SMO Security Analysis TR may need to address the Shared O-RU architectural options.
The second phase of the SMO Security Analysis TR will need to consider Transport Node (TN) Termination, as specified in WG9, and Cooperative Transport Interface (CTI), as specified in WG4.
Recommendations
The Security Analysis presented in this technical report used the following process:
Asset identification -> 2. Threat identification -> 3. Threat analysis -> 4. Risk analysis -> 5. Recommend Security Controls
The SMO is a logical framework, not an implementation architecture, with external interfaces and internal functions and interfaces that are assets which should be protected with security controls.  The SMO may be implemented as a monolithic platform or multiple disaggregated functions, such as SMO functions and Non-RT-RIC functions, which should be protected assets.  Other SMO assets are the R1, A1, O1, O2, OFH M-Plane, and External interfaces and data at rest and in transit.
Recommendation 1: WG11 should update the Security Threat Modeling and Remediation Analysis document [6] to include the assets identified in this security analysis technical report.  A CR will be generated.
For the threat analysis, external and internal threats were considered from the perspective of the SMO.  Internal threats are internal the SMO and external threats are external to the SMO. External threats may be external to the SMO and internal to the O-RAN architecture.  More than 30 threats were identified, categorized as general SMO threats, O2 interface threats, and External interfaces threat.
Recommendation 2: WG11 should update the Security Threat Modeling and Remediation Analysis document [6] to include the threats and threat tables created in this security analysis technical report.  A CR will be generated.
Risk analysis of the identified threats included impact-likelihood scoring.  All 30+ of the identified threats were score either high-medium or high-high. External data sources are considered the greatest threat to the SMO due to the risk of an external threat actor poisoning external data that is imported into the SMO and the risk of an external threat actor exploiting an API on the external interface to gain access to the SMO or perform a remote code execution attack.
Likelihood scoring was influenced by the consideration of a zero trust architecture (ZTA), which is a publicly expressed goal of the O-RAN Alliance to consider external and internal threats.  ZTA is built on the foundational principles that perimeter defenses are insufficient to secure a network as internal external threats pose risk to a network.  There are two guidelines for designing a network and its network functions for a ZTA:
There is no implicit trust granted to an asset based upon ownership, physical location, or network location [8].
Assume the adversary is already inside the network [9].
The security controls recommended in this TR protect the SMO from confidentiality, integrity, and availability attacks from external and internal threats, consistent with a ZTA.
Recommendation 3: The SMO should have security controls implemented to protect its functions and interfaces from external and internal threats, consistent with a ZTA. Specific requirements will be formed as this work item continues.  A CR for the WG11 Security Requirements Specifications is planned for the March release train.
Consistent with a ZTA, the SMO should be secure by design in which its security posture does not assume that the SMO internal functions and interfaces are secure.
Recommendation 4: WG11 should collaborate with WG1 to ensure the WG11 security specifications are referenced by WG1 in its SMO specifications.  This process will build-in security to the evolving specifications for the SMO and Decoupled SMO.
The SMO architecture is continuing to evolve to support Decoupled SMO and direct communication between internal SMO functions and applications.  In addition, the security analysis will also need to consider Transport Node (TN) Termination, as specified in WG9, and Cooperative Transport Interface (CTI), as specified in WG4.
Recommendation 5: This SMO Security work item continues its security analysis to produce a TR v2 for the March release train, addressing Decoupled SMO, TN, and CTI.
The SMO role in certificate management is currently unspecified.
Recommendation 6: The WG11 Certificate Management work item team should investigate a potential role, if any, for the SMO in certificate management.
