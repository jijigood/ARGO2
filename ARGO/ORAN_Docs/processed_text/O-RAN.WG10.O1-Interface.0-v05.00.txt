Definitions and Abbreviations
Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
Harmonized VES Event refers to the stndDefined VES event specified in VES Event Listener Specification [32] that allows a VES event to carry, as its payload, a notification specified by another standards body.  In the case of O-RAN O1 Interface Specification, a harmonized stndDefined VES event carries a 3GPP-specified notification as its payload.
Legacy VES Event refers to any VES event specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32], except for stndDefined.  Legacy VES events are fully defined in [32] and don’t rely on another standards organization to specify the content of the payload, like stndDefined does.  Examples of Legacy VES Events are Fault, Heartbeat and FileReady Notification.
Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].

Philosophy
It is expected that O-RAN Managed Elements, specified in O-RAN Operations and Maintenance Architecture [28], comply with the O1 Interface Specification.
The O-RAN O1 management services follow existing standards wherever possible.  The focus of this document is to identify the use cases which conform to existing standards, identify gaps in management services for O-RAN and define needed extensions.  For identified gaps, the goal is to modify the standards to include the needed O-RAN extensions and update the references in this document as the standards evolve to cover the gaps. If extensions and gaps are not specified, it is expected that the management services providers and consumers are conforming to referenced 3GPP specifications.
Open Points
As each Management Service is evaluated, the Use Cases and relevant specifications need to be assessed and augmented as needed to support O-RAN. The current list of Use Cases in Chapter 2 below is not exhaustive, and the list of specification references may not be complete.
Some Use Cases referred to in the standard may not be applicable to O-RAN and this needs to be addressed, as an exception.
Future clarifications may be added to specify when citing a reference whether it is being used as a citation (meaning it will be strictly followed) or as a reference.  More precise terminology may be included as this draft matures.
O-RAN Security Focus Group (SFG) plans to develop an O-RAN security architecture, as well as security guidelines and requirements for all O-RAN Working Groups (WG) and O-RAN entities.  The security architecture, guidelines and requirements will be incorporated into existing O-RAN documents, as appropriate. The O1 Interface Specification intends to comply with the security architecture, guidelines and requirements that are applicable to the O1 interface and will provide appropriate references, when available.
It is mandatory for the O-RU to comply with the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29] for management services.  There is a joint WG1/WG4 Work Item (WI) in progress to determine how the O-RU can support management services in the O1 Interface Specification, in what time frame, and under what conditions.  Future versions of the O1 Interface Specification will be updated as necessary to reflect the decisions of this WI.
General Requirements
This section contains general requirements that are applicable to many O1 Interface Management Services.
Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)
REQ-SMO-FUN-1:  O-RAN compliant SMOs SHALL support the O1 interfaces as defined in this document.
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
TLS requirements are specified in O-RAN Security Protocol Specifications [30] section 2.2 and 2.3.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
REQ-HTP-FUN-1:  Management Service providers and consumers that use HTTP SHALL support HTTP v1.1 or higher.  HTTP v2.0 is preferred.
Secure Shell (SSH)
SSH requirements are specified in O-RAN Security Protocol Specifications [30] section 2.1.
Least Privilege Access Control
Least privilege access control requirements for the O1 interface are specified in O-RAN Security Requirements Specification [31] section 3.2.2.
Management Services
Provisioning Management Services
Provisioning management services allow a Provisioning MnS Consumer to configure attributes of managed objects on the Provisioning MnS Provider that modify the Provisioning MnS Provider’s capabilities in its role in end-to-end network services and allows a Provisioning MnS Provider to report configuration changes to the Provisioning MnS Consumer. NETCONF is used for the Provisioning Management Services to Create Managed Object Instance, Delete Managed Object Instance, Modify Managed Object Instance Attributes and Read Managed Object Instance Attributes. A REST/HTTPS event is used to notify the Provisioning MnS subscribed Consumers when a configuration change occurs.
Stage 1 Provisioning management services are specified in 3GPP TS 28.531 [3] section 6.3.
Stage 2 CM operations and notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] section 11.1.1.
Stage 3 Provisioning operations for YANG/NETCONF solution set are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] section 12.1.3.
Stage 3 CM notifications for RESTful HTTP-based solution set are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] section A.1.1.

Post-condition: Provisioning MnS Consumer reconciles its copy of the Provisioning MnS Provider configuration database with the change.
Operations and Notifications
An O-RAN CM notification is a JSON encoded asynchronous notification sent from the Provisioning MnS Provider to the Provisioning MnS Consumer using REST/HTTPS. The attribute name value pairs in the CM notifications are provided using YANG 1.1 encoded in JSON format as specified in RFC 7951 [37].
The following 3GPP CM notifications specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] are supported in O-RAN:
notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges
notifyMOICreation
notifyMOIDeletion
notifyMOIChanges
A single notifyMOIChanges notification can report one or more MOI creations, MOI deletions and MOI attribute value changes in one notification.  The notifyMOIChanges notification can be used instead of notifyMOICreation, notifyMOIDeletion and notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges notifications.  For this reason, notifyMOIChanges is recommended to support and notifyMOICreation, notifyMOIDeletion and notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges are optional to support.
An O-RAN CM notification must be in one of the following formats:
3GPP format:
A 3GPP CM notification as specified in TS 28.532 [4].
VES format:
A harmonized stndDefined VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and stndDefinedFields with a “data” element that contains a 3GPP CM notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].  The stndDefined VES event is specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32].  Annex B in this document provides more information about stndDefined VES events.
Two attributes are used to indicate the notification format:
notifFormatCapabilities indicates whether the provider supports 3GPP format, VES format or both. This attribute is set by the notification provider at the Managed Element level.  It is read-only by the notification consumer.
notifFormatConfig indicates whether the provider will send the notifications in 3GPP format or VES format. This attribute is set at the Managed Element level.  This means all notifications from a provider are sent in the same format.  The configuration is not per notification type.  If the provider only supports one format, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to the supported format.  Otherwise, if the provider supports both formats, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to VES format.  In this second case, the consumer may change this value to 3GPP format.  If the consumer attempts to set this attribute to a value not supported by the provider, the configuration will be rejected.
It is not necessary to support legacy VES for CM notifications because there are no legacy VES events defined for CM.
Subscription Control
Description
Subscription Control allows a MnS Consumer to subscribe to notifications emitted by a MnS Provider.
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Management Services Use Cases will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms.  For Subscription Control, the Subscribe and Unsubscribe operations are replaced with a NtfSubscriptionControl IOC as specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].  NtfSubscriptionControl IOC contains attributes that allow a MnS Consumer to set the recipient address for the notifications and identify the scope of notifications desired.  Optionally, the types of notifications desired, and notification filtering may also be provided.  If filtering of the notifications is supported, only those notificatons that match the specified value would be sent.  For example, notifyNewAlarm notifications can be filtered to send only those with severity set to major or critical.
Requirements
NtfSubscriptionControl IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.22 with attribute definitions in 4.4.1.
YANG models for NtfSubscriptionControl are specified in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15] section D.2.6a.
Procedures
NtfSubscriptionControl instances may be created and deleted by the system or pre-installed.  Optionally, the NtfSubscriptionControl MOIs can be created and deleted and attributes modified using NETCONF/YANG by the management service consumer following the procedures described in this Provisioning MnS section.
Operations and Notifications
Subscription Control can be used to subscribe to alarm notifications specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] section 4.4.1 notificationTypes.  Subscription Control can be used to subscribe to heartbeat notifications as specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] Figure 4.2.1-5; i.e. by creating the HeartbeatControl MOI as a child of the NtfSubscriptionControl MOI.

Fault Supervision Management Services
Fault supervision management services allow a Fault Supervision MnS Provider to report errors and events to a Fault Supervision MnS Consumer and allows a Fault Supervision MnS Consumer to perform fault supervision operations on the Fault Supervision MnS Provider, such as get alarm list.
Stage 1 Fault Supervision MnS is specified in 3GPP TS 28.545 [9].
Stage 2 fault notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
Stage 2 AlarmList IOC and AlarmRecord data type are specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].
Stage 3 Solution Sets for XML, JSON and YANG are specified in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15].
Fault Notification
Description
Fault Supervision MnS Provider sends asynchronous Fault notification event to Fault Supervision MnS Consumer when an alarm occurs, is cleared, or changes severity.
Requirements
The following fault supervision data report service requirements specified in 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.5 are supported in O-RAN:
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-1 for sending alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-3 for alarm notification subscription
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-4 for alarm notification unsubscription
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-6 for reading the alarm list
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-8 for reading the alarm list with a filter
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-9 for sending changed alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-10 for sending cleared alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-11 for sending new alarm notifications
The following requirements from 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.5 are optional in O-RAN:
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-2 for providing alarms for virtualized resources
Rationale: Alarms for virtualized resources are reported over O2 by the O-Cloud.
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-5 for filtering the alarm notifications that are reported
Rationale: Filtering of alarm notifications at the NF level is not recommended.  SMO should receive all alarm notifications generated by the NF.  Filtering is best done at the SMO level.
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-7 for maintaining an alarm list for virtualized resources
Rationale: Alarms for virtualized resources are reported over O2 by the O-Cloud.
Procedures
Procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 9.1.
Operations and Notifications
An O-RAN fault notification is a JSON encoded asynchronous notification sent from Fault Supervision MnS Provider to Fault Supervision MnS Consumers using REST/HTTPS.
The following 3GPP fault notifications specified in TS 28.532 [4] are supported in O-RAN:
notifyNewAlarm
notifyChangedAlarm and/or notifyChangedAlarmGeneral
notifyClearedAlarm
NotifyChangedAlarm only supports reporting the severity change. NotifyChangedAlarmGeneral permits the producer to report the severity change and any other attribute changes associated with this alarm in a single notification.  The other 3GPP fault notifications specified in TS 28.532 [4] are optional.  Rationale: There are no use cases defined in O-RAN where these other notifications types are sent.  If Use Cases are defined which send these notification types, then this O1 Interface Specification will be updated.
An O-RAN fault notification must be in one of the following formats:
3GPP format:
A 3GPP fault notification as specified in TS 28.532 [4].
VES format:
A harmonized stndDefined VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and stndDefinedFields with a “data” element that contains a 3GPP fault notification, as specified in TS 28.532 [4].  The stndDefined VES event is specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32].  Annex B in this document provides more information about stndDefined VES events.
A legacy fault VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and faultFields, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32], is also allowed for backward compatibility.  However, a stndDefined VES event is the preferred VES format going forward.
Two attributes are used to indicate the notification format:
notifFormatCapabilities indicates whether the provider supports 3GPP format, VES format or both. This attribute is set by the notification provider at the Managed Element level.  It is read-only by the notification consumer.
notifFormatConfig indicates whether the provider will send the notifications in 3GPP format or VES format. This attribute is set at the Managed Element level.  This means all notifications from a provider are sent in the same format.  The configuration is not per notification type.  If the provider only supports one format, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to the supported format.  Otherwise, if the provider supports both formats, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to VES format.  In this second case, the consumer may change this value to 3GPP format.  If the consumer attempts to set this attribute to a value not supported by the provider, the configuration will be rejected.
It is not necessary to have an attribute to indicate whether harmonized VES or legacy VES is sent for VES format because the VES Event Registration artifact provided by the Network Function at onboarding time specifies the schema of the VES event.
Fault Supervision Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Management Services Use Cases will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms.   For Fault Supervision, an AlarmList IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] that represents the capability to store and manage alarm records. There is one AlarmList per Fault Supervision MnS Provider, created by the Provider. The AlarmList contains one AlarmRecord for each active alarm. The AlarmRecords in the AlarmList can be read by the Fault Supervision MnS Consumer, with an optional filter to retrieve selected AlarmRecords based on the value of attributes in the AlarmRecord.  For example, Fault Supervision MnS Consumer is able to retrieve only those AlarmRecords with perceivedSeverity = CRITICAL.
Requirements
Fault supervision data report service requirements from 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.5 that are mandatory for an O-RAN Fault Supervision MnS Provider to support are specified in section 2.2.1.2.
The following fault supervision data control service requirements from 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.6 are optional for the O-RAN Fault Supervision MnS Provider to support:
REQ-FSDC_NF-FUN-1 to support alarm acknowledgement.
Rationale: There is no Use Case that requires a NF to acknowledge an alarm.  This operation is best done at the SMO level.  If the NF does not support alarm acknowledgement from the MnS Consumer, then the NF must consider cleared alarms as automatically acknowledged so that they may be removed from the AlarmList.
REQ-FSDC_NF-FUN-2 to support manual alarm clearing.
Rationale: Manual clearing of alarms is only for ADMC (Automatically Detected, Manually Cleared) alarms.  If the NF supports ADMC alarms, then this operation should be supported.  Otherwise, it is not required.
REQ-FSDC_NF-FUN-4 to support acknowledgement state change notifications.
Rationale: There is no Use Case that requires a NF to acknowledge an alarm.  This operation is best done at the SMO level.  If the NF supports alarm acknowledgement, then this operation should be supported.  Otherwise, it is not required.
Procedures
NETCONF protocol and YANG data models are used to get and set the attributes of the AlarmRecords in the AlarmList.
Refer to Provisioning management services section for procedures to read MOI attributes and modify MOI attributes using NETCONF.
AlarmList IOC Definition
AlarmList IOC definition is specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.26 and 4.3.27 with attribute definitions in section 4.4.1.
YANG solution set for AlarmList IOC is provided in TS 28.623 [15] appendix D.2.9.
Performance Assurance Management Services
Performance Assurance Management Services allow a Performance Assurance MnS Provider to report file-based (bulk) and/or streaming (real time) performance data to a Performance Assurance MnS Consumer and allows a Performance Assurance MnS Consumer to perform performance assurance operations on the Performance Assurance MnS Provider, such as selecting the measurements to be reported and setting the frequency of reporting.
Use cases are specified in 3GPP TS 28.550 [10] Section 5.1.
Stage 2 File Ready notification is specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
Stage 2 PerfMetricJob IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].
Stage 3 Solution Sets for XML, JSON and YANG are specified in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15].
Stage 2 and 3 for streaming data reporting service are specified in TS 28.532 [4].
Performance Data File Reporting
Description
Performance Assurance MnS Provider sends asynchronous FileReady notification event to Performance Assurance MnS Consumer sent when PM File(s) is ready for upload. The FileReady notification contains information needed to retrieve the file such as filename and the location where the file can be retrieved.
Performance Assurance MnS Consumer uploads PM File(s) from the location specified in the notifyFileReady notification.
Requirements
Requirements are specified in 3GPP TS 28.550 [10] section 5.2.2.

Performance Assurance MnS Provider sends FileReady notification to Performance Assurance MnS Consumer over HTTP/TLS.  Mutual certificate authentication is performed.
Performance Assurance MnS Consumer sets up a secure FTPeS or SFTP connection to the location specified in the notifyFileReady notification and uploads the PM data file(s). SFTP is authenticated with username/password, SSH keys or X.509 certificates.  FTPES is authenticated with X.509 certificates.
Operations and Notifications
An O-RAN file ready notification is a JSON encoded asynchronous notification sent from Performance Assurance MnS Provider to Performance Assurance MnS Consumers using REST/HTTPS
An O-RAN file ready notification must be in one of the following formats:
3GPP format:
A 3GPP notifyFileReady notification as specified in TS 28.532 [4].
VES format:
A harmonized stndDefined VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and stndDefinedFields with a “data” element that contains a 3GPP notifyFileReady notification, as specified in TS 28.532 [4].  The stndDefined VES event is specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32].  Annex B in this document provides more information about stndDefined VES events.
A legacy file ready VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and notificationFields, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32], is also allowed for backward compatibility.  However, a stndDefined VES event is the preferred VES format going forward.
Two attributes are used to indicate the notification format:
notifFormatCapabilities indicates whether the provider supports 3GPP format, VES format or both. This attribute is set by the notification provider at the Managed Element level.  It is read-only by the notification consumer.
notifFormatConfig indicates whether the provider will send the notifications in 3GPP format or VES format. This attribute is set at the Managed Element level.  This means all notifications from a provider are sent in the same format.  The configuration is not per notification type.  If the provider only supports one format, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to the supported format.  Otherwise, if the provider supports both formats, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to VES format.  In this second case, the consumer may change this value to 3GPP format.  If the consumer attempts to set this attribute to a value not supported by the provider, the configuration will be rejected.
It is not necessary to have an attribute to indicate whether harmonized VES or legacy VES is sent for VES format because the VES Event Registration artifact provided by the Network Function at onboarding time specifies the schema of the VES event.

5G Performance Measurements
3GPP defined 5G performance measurements are specified in 3GPP TS 28.552 [11].  In addition to the 3GPP-defined measurements, it is possible to have O-RAN defined measurements and vendor supplied measurements.  Section 2.3.4 provides requirements for O-RAN defined measurements.   O-RAN defined measurements are named with an “OR.” prefix. Vendor supplied measurements are named with a “VS.” prefix.
Performance Data Streaming
Description
Performance Assurance MnS Provider steams high volume asynchronous streaming performance measurement data to Performance Assurance MnS Consumer at a configurable frequency.  A secure WebSocket connection is established between the Performance Assurance Provider and the Performance Assurance Consumer.  The connection will support the transmission of one or more streams of PM data.  Each stream of PM data is configured as a PerfMetricJob (see section 2.3.6 of this document).  The provider supplies information about the supported streams to the consumer during the connection establishment.  The connection may be established to support one or more streams.  Streams can be added or removed from the connection as the PerfMetricJobs are added or deleted.  The connectionID that will carry the streaming PM data is provided to the Performance Assurance Provider during the establishment of the WebSocket connection by the Performance Assurance Consumer.
Requirements
Requirements for Streaming PM are specified in 3GPP TS 28.550 [10] section 5.2.3.
Procedures
Use Cases are specified in 3GPP TS 28.550 [10] section 5.1.1.3.  Procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.  These procedures are applicable to both Streaming PM and Streaming Trace.

Pre-condition:  Performance Assurance MnS Provider is configured to produce PerfMetricJob to be delivered via streaming PM to the Performance Assurance Consumer.
Performance Assurance MnS Provider requests to establish a WebSocket connection to begin streaming PM data and provides MetaData about the streams that are to be sent on the connection
Performance Assurance Consumer accepts the request to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket.
Performance Assurance MnS Provider transmits binary encoded data to consumer while performance job is active.
Operations and Notifications
3GPP TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1 defines the following operations that an O-RAN compliant NF that supports streaming PM must support.  These are the same operations listed for streaming trace in Section 2.4.6.1 of this document.  They are repeated here, as it is possible that a NF may support different levels of streaming for trace and performance assurance.
establishStreamingConnection operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.1.  Establishing the streaming connection is initiated via an HTTPS POST followed by an HTTP GET (upgrade) to establish the WebSocket connection.
terminateStreamingConnection operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.2.  This operation is accomplished via a WebSocket Close Frame to tear down the streaming connection when all stream jobs on this connection have been terminated. The delivery of WebSocket Close Frame is provided by the underlying TCP.
reportStreamData operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.3. The streamData field contains the streaming PM data which is encoded according to the format defined in TS 28.550 [10] Annex G which provides the ASN.1 definition of the Performance Data Stream Units.  The delivery of WebSocket Close Frame is provided by the underlying TCP.
If the NF supports the capability of sending multiple PM streams across the WebSocket connection, the following operations are required for O-RAN NFs.
addStream operation is specified in TS 28.532 Section 11.5.1.4.  This operation is used when a new Performance Assurance Stream (PM job started) is added on the Performance Assurance Provider to be delivered to this consumer and the NF supports multiple streams per connection. The addStream operation is accomplished via an HTTP POST.
deleteStream operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.5.  This operation is used when a Performance Assurance Stream (PM job stopped) is deleted from the connection between the Performance Assurance Provider and the Performance Assurance Consumer.  The deleteStream operation is accomplished via an HTTP DELETE.
The following operations are specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1 but are optional for O-RAN NFs as there is no use case requiring them.
getConnectionInfo operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.6. This operation allows the performance data streaming service provider to get information from the performance data streaming service consumer on the streams active on the connection.  There is no use case in O-RAN requiring this operation.
getStreamInfo operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.7. This operation allows the performance data streaming service provider to get the information for one or more streams from the streaming consumer (i.e. stream target).  There is no use case in O-RAN requiring this operation.
No notifications have been defined for Performance Data Streaming.
PM Streaming Data Generation and Reporting
3GPP TS 28.550 [10] Annex C lists all the Performance Data Stream Unit Content Items. Annex C of this document provides a description of the establishment of the WebSocket connection and the subsequent operations that will be provided as part of the data streaming service.  The example utilizes the trace service, but the operations around the establishment and tear down of the connection are the same for streaming PM and streaming Trace.  The WebSocket connection will remain until all streams configured to be provided between the PA Provider and the PA Consumer have been terminated.
PM Streaming Data Format
PM streaming data will be delivered in binary format encoded in ASN.1.  3GPP TS 28.550 [10] Annex G provides ASN.1 definiton.
Measurement Job Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Performance Assurance Control will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms in the Measurement Job Control Service.   For Performance Assurance, this includes operations such as Create Measurement Job, Terminate Measurement Job, Query Measurement Job, Suspend Measurement Job and Resume Measurement Job.   Measurement jobs can be created and terminated by creating and deleting a PerfMetricJob MOI.  Measurement jobs can be queried by getting the attributes of a PerfMetricJob MOI.  Measurement jobs can be temporarily suspended or resumed by modifying the administrativeState attribute of a PerfMetricJob MOI to LOCKED or UNLOCKED.
Requirements
Requirements for measurement job control are specified in TS 28.550 [10] section 5.2.1.
Procedures
Procedures for measurement job creation, termination, query, suspend and resume are specified in TS 28.622 [14]  section 4.3.31.
NETCONF protocol and YANG data models are used to create MOI, delete MOI, modify attributes and get attributes of a PerfMetricJob.  Refer to Provisioning management services section for detailed procedures on how to perform these operations using NETCONF.
PerfMetricJob IOC Definition
PerfMetricJob IOC definition is specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.31 with attribute definitions in section 4.4.1.  SupportedPerfMetricGroup datatype is specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.32.  ReportingCtrl specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.33.
YANG solution set for PerfMetricJob IOC is provided in TS 28.623 [15] appendix D.2.4.
O-RAN Defined Performance Measurements
Requirements
REQ-OPM-FUN-1:  O-RAN specific counters shall be defined using the template specified in 3GPP TS 32.404 [20].
REQ-OPM-FUN-2:  The Measurement Name for O-RAN defined counters shall not exceed 64 characters in length and should be constrained to 32 characters maximum.
REQ-OPM-FUN-3:  Measurement Name of O-RAN defined counters shall begin with OR.xxx to indicate that O-RAN is the source of the measurement.  When a measurement is accepted in 3GPP, the OR prefix shall be deleted.
Annex A provides an example of how two previously defined O-RAN O-RU counters could be re-specified following the template in 3GPP TS 32.404 [20].  PLEASE NOTE, the O1 Interface Specification will not be specifying O-RAN counters.  It is the responsibility of the Working Groups to do this specification.  This Annex is informational to provide possible examples for defining counters as required in this document.  O-RAN defined counters will be documented in the appropriate Working Group specifications.
Trace Management Services
Trace management services allow a Trace MnS Provider to report file-based or streaming trace records to the Trace MnS Consumer.  Trace Control provides the ability for the Trace Consumer to start a trace session by configuring a Trace Job via the Trace Control IOC or by establishing a trace session that will propagate trace parameters to other trace management providers via signaling.  There are multiple levels of trace that can be supported on the provider as described in 3GPP TS 32.421 [21] Section 4.1. The Trace Provider may be configured to support file-based trace reporting or streaming trace reporting.
Trace Management Services specified in 3GPP TS 32.421 [21], TS 32.422 [22] and TS 32.423 [23] and supported on an applicable O-RAN ME include Call Trace, Minimization of Drive Testing (MDT), RRC Connection Establishment Failure (RCEF) and Radio Link Failure TCE (RLF).  All of these services follow a similar management paradigm. Trace Sessions are configured on the provider with information on where and how to send the trace information to the consumer.  The provider creates trace records within a trace session as the trigger mechanism occurs.  Trace records are produced and provided to the consumer until the trace session is terminated.
File-based trace collects trace records in files that are available to the consumer with a time delay.  In the case of streaming trace, the data is sent in bursts across a WebSocket connection to the consumer, maintaining the relevance of the data while minimizing transport overhead.
Stage 1 Trace Management Service is specified in 3GPP TS 32.421 [21].  Use cases for trace are specified in Section 5.8 and elaborated in TS 32.421 [21] Annex A.  General Trace Requirements are found in TS 32.421 [21] section 5.1.
Stage 2 Trace Operations are found in TS 32.422 [22] for 5G support of Call Trace and for streaming trace.
Stage 2 Trace Control IOC for management-based control is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].  Stage 2 for signaling based activation is found in TS 32.422 [22].
Stage 3 definitions of trace record content for all trace types, XML trace file format, and streaming trace GPB record definition are found in TS 32.423 [23].
Stage 3 Trace Control IOC mapping for management-based control is specified in TS 28.623 [15] section D.2.10.
Stage 2 and 3 definition of streaming data reporting are found in TS 28.532 [4].
Call Trace
Trace Data Reporting
Description
Trace Data can be reported from the Trace Provider to the Trace Consumer via trace files or via a streaming interface. For management-based activation, Trace Data is collected after the TraceJob is configured on the Trace Provider, the Trace Session is activated, and the triggering event occurs. For signaling-based activation, the Trace Recording Session starts when the NF receives trace control and configuration parameters via one of the signalling messages specified in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.2.3.12.
When the Trace Provider collects trace data to a file, the file is periodically provided to the Trace Consumer.  When the provider supports streaming trace, the trace is sent to the consumer via data bursts which are sent frequently enough to retain the relevance of the data while conserving transport resources. The WebSocket connection carrying the streaming trace is preserved for the duration of the streaming trace.
Requirements
Requirements for Trace data are specified in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.2 and are applicable to both file-based and streaming trace.
Procedures
Trace Data is binary encoded and reported in Trace Records.  The procedures for reporting data are specified in TS 32.422 [22] Section 7.  File-based trace reporting procedures are found in TS 32.422 [22] Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1.  Streaming trace reporting procedures are found in TS 32.422 [22] Sections 7.1.2 and 7.2.2.  Trace Record Contents are specified in TS 32.423 [23] Section 4. The Trace Record content is the same for trace jobs controlled by management-based activation and signaling-based activation.  The raw trace record content is the same for file-based trace and streaming trace.  Trace data is binary encoded in ASN.1.  File-based trace is delivered in XML format with trace records encoded in ASN.1.  Streaming trace is delivered in GPB encoded data bursts with the trace record payload containing ASN.1 encoded data.
Procedures for naming the trace data file are found in TS 32.423 [23] Annex B.  File Naming Convention is fully specified in TS 32.423 [23] Annex B.1.
Trace files are produced in XML format. The XML format is specified in TS 32.423 [23] Annex A2.2.  Example XML files are provided in TS 32.423 [23] Annex D.
If a trace file cannot be created, a trace failure notification file XML schema should be sent.  The XML schema is provided in TS 32.422 [22] Annex A.5 and the naming convention for the file containing the failure is specified in Annex A.4.
For streaming trace, raw trace data is collected on the node and sent to the trace collector.  The trace data will be binary encoded.  The format of the streaming trace data is provided in TS 32.423 [23].  The reportStreamData operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.4.
Trace Session Activation
Description
A trace session will start on a provider configured to support a TraceJob via management or signaling-based activation.  Management-based trace session activation is initiated from the Provisioning Management Service Consumer to activate a TraceJob which has been configured on the provider.  See Section 2.4.5 of this document.  With signaling-based trace session activation, the provider receives a signaling message that contains trace consumer ID address (IP address for file-based or URI for streaming) along with trace control parameters.  Each Trace session has a unique trace session identifier that is associated with all of the trace data collected for this session.
If the trace session is configured to be file-based, the provider collects the data and stores the data in a file.  The provider optionally sends the file directly to the consumer or sends the location of the file to the consumer.  File transport approach is not standardized.
SA5 Rel 16 introduces the support of streaming trace from the provider to the consumer.  Trace data for a trace session is collected and transmitted to the provider across a secure WebSocket connection in data bursts which are emitted frequently enough to ensure the relevance of the data while conserving transport resources. See section 2.4.6 and Annex C of this document for details on the streaming service.
Requirements
Requirements for Trace Session Activation for file-based and streaming trace are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.3.1.

Trace Recording Session Activation
Description
A trace recording session is a specific instance of the data specified to be collected for a particular trace session, for example, a specific call.  For management-based activation, the trace recording session will start on a provider configured with an active trace session when a triggering event occurs, such as a new call starting.  Each Trace recording session within a trace session has a unique trace recording session reference. This recording session reference and the session reference are included with each trace record, uniquely identifying the trace record as belonging to a particular trace recording session. For signaling-based activation, the Trace Recording Session starts when the NF receives trace control and configuration parameters via a control signalling message. TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.3.2.12 outlines the procedures the node is to follow when determining when to begin a new trace recording session and when to continue with an existing session.
Requirements

Trace Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, Management-based Trace Control will be supported with IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms in the Trace Control Service.  For Trace Control, this includes operations such as Create TraceJob, Activate TraceJob, Deactivate TraceJob, and Query TraceJobs.  TraceJobs can be created, activated, deactivated and queried by setting and/or getting attributes in the TraceJob IOC.  The TraceJob IOC supports Management-based activation for Call Trace, MDT, RLF and RCEF.
Trace sessions can also be activated and deactivated via signalingbased configuration initiated from another NF to propagate a configured trace, such as a UE trace when the UE moves from one NF to another.
Requirements
Management-based activation and deactivation will be done via the TraceJob IOC defined in TS 28.622 [14] Section 4.30.  Requirements for TraceJob Activation are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.3.1 and requirements for TraceJob deactivation are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.4.1.  The requirements are applicable for both Management and Signaling activation.
Procedures
Management-based activation and deactivation will be accomplished using CRUD operations specified in section 2.1 of this document.  The attributes of the TraceJob are specified in TS 28.622 [14] Section 4.3.30.2. Constraints on these attributes are specified in TS 28.622 [14] Section 4.3.30.3.   Trace Control IOC mapping for management-based control is specified in TS 28.623 [15].   The YANG model for the Trace Control IOC  is specified in TS 28.623 [15] section D.2.10.
Procedures for Signaling-based Trace Session Activation are found in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.2.
Procedures for Trace Session Deactivation are found in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.4.
Streaming Trace
A NF can be configured to deliver trace data via a file or via a streaming interface.  The streaming capability was introduced in SA5 Release 16.  The additional requirements and procedures supported for streaming trace are provided in this section.  An example of the configuration, activation, recording and termination of a streaming trace connection are shown in Informative Annex C.
Streaming Trace Requirements and Procedures
As noted above, trace session and recording activation and deactivation, as well as the content of the trace record, are the same for file-based and streaming trace.  The requirements for streaming trace delivery are found in TS 32.421 [21]  Section 5.5.  Operations for establishing the streaming connection, adding and deleting streams from the connection and reporting streaming trace data are found in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.  O-RAN NFs supporting streaming trace must support the establishStreamingConnection, reportStreamData and terminateStreamingConnection operations.  O-RAN NFs that support the multiplexing of trace streams across a single connection must support the addStream and deleteStream operations.  Optionally, the NF may also support the getConnectionInfo and getStreamInfo operations which allow the provider to query for information on the connection and streams on the connection.  This is optional in O-RAN as there are no use cases currently defined that require this operation.  No notifications have been defined for streaming trace.
Stage 3 information on the streaming operations is provided in TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5 with Open API YAML definition provided in Annex 6.1.2.
The procedure for establishStreamingConnection is an HTTP POST operation to provide the information on the stream to the consumer and to receive the Connection ID as a response.  The HTTP POST is followed by an HTTP GET to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket connection.  This operation is used when no connection is established between the provider and the consumer.  The WebSocket connection can contain one or more streams of data from streaming trace or streaming PM. See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.2.
The terminateStreamingConnection is a WebSocket close frame operation.  This operation is used when all streams on a connection have terminated.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.3.
The addStream Operation is an HTTP POST to indicate that additional streams are being added to the connection.  A stream is a trace job or a streaming PM job.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.5.
The deleteStream Operation is an HTTP DELETE to indicate that a stream has been terminated from the connection.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.6.
The reportStreamData is a WebSocket data frame sent across the connection containing the streaming trace or streaming PM data or an optional alive message indicating that the stream is active, but no data is available.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.4.
The getConnectionInfo Operation is an HTTP GET from the provider to the consumer to obtain information about the connection, such as which streams are supported.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.7.
The getStreamInfo Operation is an HTTP GET from the provider to the consumer to obtain information on the stream. See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.8.
Annex C in this document provides a streaming trace activation example for management-based activation control.
File Management Services
File management services allow a File Management MnS Consumer to request the transfer of files between the File Management MnS Provider and the File Management MnS Consumer.
Use cases are based on the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
Relevant 3GPP specifications for file transfer are 3GPP TS 32.341 [17], TS 32.342 [18] and TS 32.346 [19].  Alignment between 3GPP and O-RAN for File Management is targeted for 3GPP SA5 Rel 17.  After the 3GPP CRs are approved, this section will be updated to align with 3GPP.
File Ready Notification
Description
The File Ready Notification notifies a File Management MnS Consumer that a file is available for upload from the File Management MnS Provider.  In general, File Management MnS Provider sends a notifyFileReady notification for files that the File Management MnS Consumer has configured the File Management MnS Provider to collect on a periodic basis, such as file-based Trace Data or PM Measurement Reports.
Requirements
notifyFileReady notification event is a JSON encoded VES event, that consists of a Common VES Event Header and notifyFileReady Notification Fields. It will be specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] as part of the 3GPP/VES alignment normative work.  Until that time, the VES Event Listener Specification [32] specifies the FileReady notification.
Procedures
File Management MnS Consumer configures a File Management MnS Provider to collect data files with specific characteristics that the File Management MnS Consumer desires, such as file-based Trace Data or PM Measurement Reports described in the Performance Assurance Section of this document.  After configuration, the File Management MnS Consumer terminates the configuration session and waits for the File Management MnS Provider to report that the file is ready for collection.
When a file is available, the File Management MnS Provider sends a notifyFileReady notification to the File Management MnS Consumer using REST/HTTPS.

Standards Additions to support O-RAN
O-RAN will contact 3GPP reps to propose that the 3GPP/VES alignment includes re-naming of some fields within the notification to provide more clarity, such as renaming the changeIdentifier field in the Notification event supporting VES FileReady to a name more aligned with the field’s purpose, such as fileType  or to add an additional field called fileType which can be utilized to specify the type of file available for upload.  The 3GPP specification will need to be updated if O-RAN wants to put specific naming conventions on the types of files that will be available for upload.
O-RAN will request that 3GPP add FTPeS to the transport requirements supported in 3GPP TS 32.342 [18].
File Types Supported
File Type requirements are documented in 3GPP TS 32.341 [17] section 5.2.
File Naming Requirements
File Naming requirements are specified in 3GPP TS 32.342 [18] Annex A.
List Available Files
Description
File Management MnS Consumer queries the File Management MnS Provider to identify files that are available on the File Management MnS Provider.  Upon receipt of the available files and their locations, the File Management MnS Consumer can determine the next appropriate action.
Requirements
Requirements on the types of files are found in section 5.4 of 3GPP TS 32.341 [17].  O-RAN may request that additional file types be specified in Rel-17 as part of the NRM fragment creation for List Available Files.
Procedures
List Available Files Use Case allows the File Management MnS Consumer to obtain a list of available files and their locations by reading the AvailableFileList IOC as specified in 3GPP TS 32.342 [18].  A File Management MnS Consumer may use this management service in scenarios where the File Management MnS Provider is collecting information, such as logs, on a standard basis in support of debugging activities.  Under normal operations, the File Management MnS Provider does not send this data to the File Management MnS Consumer as the File Management MnS Consumer does not need it.  The File Management MnS Provider retains the data with the oldest data being over-written when space is exhausted.  In some scenarios, the File Management MnS Consumer may want to upload some, or all, of the available log files to resolve an issue.  In this case, File Management MnS Consumer sends a NETCONF <get> command to the File Management MnS Provider to obtain the list of available files.  File Management MnS Provider responds with AvailableFileList which contains a list of available files and their locations and file types.  File Management MnS Consumer may use this information to transfer the desired files.  See Transfer File Service section 2.5.3.
The File Management MnS Consumer does not have to initiate a file upload as a result of the obtaining the list of available files.  There are use cases where the File Management MnS Consumer may want to verify that files are being collected or verify that all files of a particular type (PM for example) have been uploaded.

File Transfer by File Management MnS Consumer
Description
The File Transfer by File Management MnS Consumer Use Case provides the capability for a File Management MnS Consumer to transfer files from or to the File Management MnS Provider.  In this use case, File Management MnS Consumer is the client and File Management MnS Provider is the file server.
The File Management MnS Consumer may perform this action as a result of:
notifyFileReady notification from the File Management MnS Provider informing the File Management MnS Consumer that a file(s)is available
Querying the File Management MnS Provider for the list of available files (see section 2.5.2).
A need to transfer a file from a known location on the File Management MnS Provider.
A need to transfer a file to a known location on the File Management MnS Provider.  Some examples of files that could be transferred to the FileManagement MnS Provider are:

(Optional) If the download takes a long time, File Management MnS Provider may send periodic downloadFile notifications to the File Management MnS Consumer with the current status of the download (download in progress).
When download completes, File Management MnS Provider sends a downloadFile notification to the File Management MnS Consumer with the final status of the download (success, file missing, failure).
Operations and Notifications
downloadFile notification is a JSON encoded VES event sent from File Management MnS Provider to File Management MnS Consumer using REST/HTTPS.  It consists of a Common VES Event Header and fileDownload Notification Fields to notify the File Management MnS Consumer of the progress and status of a file download.  This event needs to be defined in VES and included in the 3GPP harmonization activity.
Heartbeat Management Services
Heartbeat MnS allow a Heartbeat MnS Provider to send heartbeats to the Heartbeat MnS Consumer and allow the Heartbeat MnS Consumer to configure the heartbeat services on the Heartbeat MnS Provider.
Stage 1 Heartbeat MnS is specified in 3GPP TS 28.537 [6]. This Release 16 specification is aligned with the Services Based Management Architecture (SBMA) approach and contains Use Cases, Requirements and Procedures for configuring the heartbeat period, reading the heartbeat period, triggering an immediate heartbeat notification and emitting a periodic heartbeat notification.
Stage 2 notifyHeartbeat notification is specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
Stage 2 HeartbeatControl IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].
Stage 3 Solution Sets for XML, JSON and YANG are specified in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15].
Heartbeat Notification
Description
Heartbeat MnS Provider sends asynchronous heartbeat notifications to Heartbeat MnS Consumer at a configurable frequency to allow Heartbeat MnS Consumer to supervise the connectivity to the Heartbeat MnS Provider.
Requirements
Requirements for heartbeat notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.537 [6] section 4.2.2.2.
Procedures
Procedures for heartbeat notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.537 [6] section 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.
Operations and Notifications
An O-RAN heartbeat notification is a JSON encoded asynchronous notification sent from Heartbeat MnS Provider to Heartbeat MnS Consumer using REST/HTTPS.  An O-RAN heartbeat notification must be in one of the following formats:
3GPP format:
A 3GPP notifyHeartbeat notification as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
VES format:
A harmonized stndDefined VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and stndDefinedFields with a “data” element that contains a 3GPP notifyHeartbeat notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].  The stndDefined VES event is specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32].  Annex B in this document provides more information about stndDefined VES events.
A legacy heartbeat VES event, consisting of a VES commonEventHeader and heartbeatFields, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32], is also allowed for backward compatibility.  However, a stndDefined VES event is the preferred VES format going forward.
Two attributes are used to indicate the notification format:
notifFormatCapabilities indicates whether the provider supports 3GPP format, VES format or both. This attribute is set by the notification provider at the Managed Element level.  It is read-only by the notification consumer.
notifFormatConfig indicates whether the provider will send the notifications in 3GPP format or VES format. This attribute is set at the Managed Element level.  This means all notifications from a provider are sent in the same format.  The configuration is not per notification type.  If the provider only supports one format, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to the supported format.  Otherwise, if the provider supports both formats, the provider sets the default value for this attribute to VES format.  In this second case, the consumer may change this value to 3GPP format.  If the consumer attempts to set this attribute to a value not supported by the provider, the configuration will be rejected.
It is not necessary to have an attribute to indicate whether harmonized VES or legacy VES is sent for VES format because the VES Event Registration artifact provided by the Network Function at onboarding time specifies the schema of the VES event.
Heartbeat Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Management Services Use Cases will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms.   For Heartbeat MnS, a Heartbeat Control IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] that includes attributes to Get/Set Heartbeat Period, (heartbeatNtfPeriod) and Trigger Immediate Heartbeat (triggerHeartbeatNtf).   .
Requirements
Requirements for heartbeat control are specified in 3GPP TS 28.537 [6] section 4.2.2.1.
Procedures
Procedures for heartbeat control are specified in 3GPP TS 28.537 [6] section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.
NETCONF protocol and YANG data models are used to read and configure the heartbeatNtfPeriod and triggerHeartbeatNtf in the HeartbeatControl IOC.  Refer to the Provisioning management services section for procedures to read MOI attributes and modify MOI attributes using NETCONF.
HeartbeatControl IOC Definition
HeartbeatControl IOC definition is specified in3GPP TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.
YANG solution set for HeartbeatControl IOC is provided in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15] Annex D.2.6a.
PNF Startup and Registration Management Services
PNF Startup and Registration management services allow a physical PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider to acquire its network layer parameters either via static procedures (pre-configured in the element) or via dynamic procedures (Plug-n-Play) during startup. During this process, the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider also acquires the IP address of the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer for PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider registration. Once the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider registers, the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer can then bring the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider to an operational state.
Relevant 3GPP specifications for PNF Plug-n-Play (PnP) are 3GPP TS 32.508 [24] and TS 32.509 [25].  Additional Plug-n-Play information for IPV6 and other O-RAN extensions can be found in O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
Alignment between 3GPP and O-RAN for PNF startup and registration is targeted for 3GPP SA5 Rel 17.  Normative work includes an update to add the pnfRegistration event and an update to add new DHCP tags for IPv6 and O-RU. After the 3GPP CRs are approved, this section will be updated to align with 3GPP.
PNF Plug-n-Play
Description
PNF Plug-n-Play (PnP) scenario enables a PNF ME to obtain the necessary start-up configuration to allow it to register with a PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer for subsequent management.
Requirements
Assuming O-RAN proposes a new Stage 1 spec for PNF Plug-n-Play and Registration, the PNF PnP requirements will be specified there.  Until that time, the PNF PnP requirements are found in 3GPP TS 32.508 [24].
Procedures
Assuming O-RAN proposes a new Stage 1 spec for PNF Plug-n-Play and Registration, the PNF PnP procedures will be specified there.  Until that time, the PNF PnP procedures are found in 3GPP TS 32.508 [24].
PNF Registration
Description

Post-condition: PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer registers the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider so that it can be managed.
Operations and Notifications
pnfRegistration notification is a JSON encoded VES event sent from PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider to PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer using REST/HTTPS.  It consists of a Common VES Event Header and pnfRegistration Notification Fields.
pnfRegistration notification event will be specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] as part of the 3GPP/VES alignment normative work.  Until that time, the pnfRegistration notification is specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [32].
PNF Software Management Services
Software management services allow a PNF Software MnS Consumer to request a physical PNF Software MnS Provider to download, install, validate and activate a new software package and allow a physical PNF Software MnS Provider to report its software versions.  O-RAN will utilize the liaison to 3GPP to initiate enhancements to the 3GPP specifications for PNF Software Management.  Until those enhancements are put in place, O-RAN PNF Software Management will be described in this specification.  Software management described in this document is modeled on the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
Alignment between 3GPP and O-RAN for PNF software management is targeted for 3GPP SA5 Rel 17. After the 3GPP CRs are approved, this section will be updated to align with 3GPP.
Software Package Naming and Content
PNF Software Package naming, content and format are vendor specific and do not require standardization in O-RAN.  A PNF Software Package may contain one or more files.  Some of the files in the Software Package may be optional for the PNF (example: a file that has not changed version).  The PNF is aware of the content and format of its available Software Packages and can determine which files it needs to download.
The softwarePackage Managed Object Class (MOC) contains attributes about a software package such as:  software package name, version, fileList, integrityStatus (valid, invalid, empty), runningState (active, passive), vendor, productName, softwareType (operational, factory), etc. This MOC is applicable to VNFs and PNFs and is a generic term that O-RAN will use to refer to the software available on the PNF rather than the legacy term of software slot
The PNF creates one instance of softwarePackage for each software package supported concurrently on the PNF.  Typically, a PNF will have two softwarePackage MOIs for operational software; one with runningState = active and one with runningState = passive.  Some PNFs also have a softwarePackage MOI for the factory software which would be read only.  O-RAN may have PNFs that support more than one passive slot.  In this case the inventory query result would show multiple MOIs with runningState=passive.
Software Inventory

Annex A: (Informative) O-RAN Performance Measurement Definition Example
A.1 3GPP TS 32.404 PM Template Usage
Two examples are presented below to illustrate how to use the 3GPP TS 32.404 [20] template to specify already defined O-RAN O-RU performance measurements.  The sample template is shown first, followed by a snippet of the corresponding 3GPP XML PM file for illustration purposes.  These examples are not intended to be precise definitions of counters but are intended to show how one can convert two existing O-RU counters to conform to the 3GPP TS 32.404 [20] template format.  The O-RAN defined PM counters will be defined and documented by the Working Groups producing them; e.g. WG4 for O-RU, WG5 for O-DU, etc.
We expect that the Working Groups will create a template similar to table A.1.1.1 for each counter defined and that these tables will be part of the official documentation.  The XML files do not need to be included in the Working Group documents.

Annex B: (Informative) Guidelines and Example for stndDefined VES Events
B.1: Guidelines for use of stndDefined VES for sending 3GPP MnS notifications
3GPP has published an informative Annex B in TS 28.532 [4] providing guidelines for the integration of 3GPP MnS notifications with VES.  This Annex expands on the information provided by 3GPP.
When an O-RAN and 3GPP compliant ME supports VES stndDefined events for sending asynchronous notifications, the native 3GPP notification, as defined by 3GPP, is included in the event.
A VES common event header, as defined by VES Event Listener Specification [32], is added to the notification.
In VES, the domain field in the common event header is used to route the event to the proper consumers and to map to a schema for the event payload.  VES Event Listener Specification [32] added a new domain field enumeration value called stndDefined that indicates that the event is complying with a schema defined by a standards body.
An additional field was added to the VES common event header called stndDefinedNamespace, which contains a valid namespace as defined by the standards body.  This field is only populated when the domain is stndDefined.  3GPP has defined four namespaces in TS 28.532 [4] Annex B; namely 3GPP-Provisioning, 3GPP-Heartbeat, 3GPP-FaultSupervision and 3GPP-PerformanceAssurance.  A VES collector uses the stndDefinedNamespace, along with the stndDefined domain, to route the event to the correct consumer.
A stndDefined VES event has a field structure called stndDefinedFields, specified in VES Event Listener Specification [32].  This structure contains three properties:
schemaReference (type = string, format = uri)
data (JSON object which should be identical to the 3GPP notification)
stndDefinedFieldsVersion (type = string, format = enum)
The schemaReference, if present, should be used to verify that the notification content is correct.  3GPP is publishing the notification schemas, in JSON format, to a public repository, (https://forge.3gpp.org/rep/sa5) so that schema references can be included in the event.
The data element contains the 3GPP notification, in JSON format, as specified in 28.532 [4].
The stndDefinedFieldsVersion provides the version of the stndDefinedFields structure, as defined by VES Event Listener Specification [32].
Annex B.2 provides an example of a stndDefined VES event for a new alarm notification.
B.2: Example stndDefined VES event for a new alarm notification
The following example illustrates the population of a new alarm notification using a stndDefined VES event.
The VES Common Header is shown from line 44 through line 58.  Note that it contains:
the domain set to stndDefined
the stndDefinedNamespace set to 3GPP-FaultSupervision.
The stndDefinedFields structure begins on line 59.  Note that it contains:
the 3GPP schema reference for the 3GPP fault notification type
the data element which contains the full 3GPP notifyNewAlarm fault notification
the version of the stndDefinedFields.

Figure C-1 :  Streaming Trace Connection Establishment, Data Reporting and Deactivation Example
Scenario
Provisioning Management Service Consumer activates/configures Trace Session on Trace Provider.  This will be accomplished using Provisioning Management services described in Section 2.1 of this document.
Trace Provider sends a notifyMOIChanges to indicate the new MOI is created.
Trace Provider needs to establish a connection to the Trace Consumer to set up a streaming connection (streams are active at this time between the Provider and Consumer). This is done using the establishStreamingConnection Operation via an HTTP POST request containing MetaData associated with this Trace Session.
Trace Consumer responds with an acknowledgement that contains the ConnectionID needed by the Provider when requesting that the connection be upgraded to a WebSocket to support streaming of the trace data.
Trace Provider requests the upgrade of the connection to a WebSocket using the ConnectionID and an HTTP GET operation.
Trace Consumer accepts the upgrade and WebSocket is established.  WebSocket will remain connected until the last streaming trace session active on the Trace Provider is ended.  Note in this example, only one streaming trace session is active.
Trace Provider starts trace session, waiting for triggering event to occur.
Triggering event occurs and a new trace recording session is started on the Trace Provider.  Each trace recording session has a unique Trace Recording Session (TRS) Reference associated with it.
Trace Provider sends Trace Data to Trace Consumer indicating that this is the start of a new trace record session. The start trace recording session information is included in the reportStreamingData Operation.
While this trace record is active, the Trace Provider collects trace data.
When the reporting timer expires or enough trace data is available, the Trace Provider sends a trace data report to the Trace Consumer containing trace record data for active recording sessions in a trace session.  These records are the payload of the reportStreamingData operation.
If the timer expires, but no trace data is present on the Trace Provider, the producer will send an alive message to the Trace Consumer to confirm that the session is still active.  The alive message is the payload of the reportStreamingData operation.
When the criteria for the trace recording session completion occurs (call ends, etc.), the Trace Provider stops collecting data for this trace recording session.
Trace Provider creates a record that indicates this trace recording session has ended and includes this record in the payload of the reportStreamingData operation to the Trace Consumer.
Provisioning Management Service Consumer deactivates the trace via procedures defined in section 2.1 of this document.  Deactivation means that the trace data collection should cease, and the Trace Provider should stop all active trace recording sessions and send data that it has collected up to this point, if any, for each active trace recording to the Trace Consumer.
Trace Provider initiates the termination of the trace session.
For each active session, Trace Provider initiates a Stop Trace Recording Session.
If there are outstanding record(s) for this trace recording session that have not been streamed to the Trace Consumer, Trace Provider sends them as the payload of the reportStreamingData operation.
Trace Provider informs the Trace Consumer that this Trace Recording Session has ended by sending the trace record termination via the reportStreamingData Operation. The producer repeats this until all trace recording sessions for this trace session have been terminated.
In this example, only one stream was on the connection, so the WebSocket should be disconnected.  To accomplish this, Trace Provider sends the Trace Consumer the deleteStream operation indicating that this Trace Session has been terminated.
When all active Trace Sessions between Trace Provider and Trace Consumer have ended, the WebSocket connection is to be torn down.  In this example, this occurs when this session terminates because only one session is active.  To terminate the session, Trace Provider sends the Trace Consumer the terminateSignalingConnection Operation which is a WebSocket close frame.
WebSocket connection is torn down.
