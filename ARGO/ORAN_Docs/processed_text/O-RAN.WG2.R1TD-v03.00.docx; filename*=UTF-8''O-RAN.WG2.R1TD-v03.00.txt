3	Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

3.1	Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in R1GAP [2], R1AP [1], and the following apply:

DME type: data type managed and exposed by the DME services and identified by a DME type identifier.

NOTE: 	The present document defines O-RAN specific DME types and O-RAN re-uses 3GPP data types where applicable.

3.2	Symbols

Void

3.3	Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations apply:

RAT				Radio Access Technology

4. 	R1 Application data model

4.1 	Introduction

The present document together with R1AP[1] defines the realization of the R1 procedures defined in R1GAP [2] and R1UCR [3].

R1AP [1] contains the service description, service operations, resource definition and the API definition (including the Open API document) for the R1 services. The present document contains the data model and the definitions of the schema-based objects transported in the procedures defined for the R1 services.

The data types defined in the present document are API-independent and are lifecycle independently from the APIs defined in R1AP [1].

4.2 	Version conventions for the present document

The version number of the present document follows the "xx.yy" versioning scheme. There could be implications for the compatibility between implementations that uses DME types defined in different versions of this specification.

An incremented "xx" version field of the present document could indicate that a new major feature (e.g., a new DME type) has been added, removed or that an incompatible change has been made to one or more DME types. An incremented "yy" version field could indicate that an optional feature has been added, a technical issue has been fixed, or that clarifications or editorial corrections have been made.

The compatibility of rApps and R1 service API implementations in SMO/Non-RT RIC framework depends on the R1 service APIs and data types that are implemented. The present document handles the versions for protocol-agnostic data types used by the R1 services while the R1 service API versioning aspects are handled in R1AP [1].

5. 	Data type definitions for Data Management and Exposure services

5.1 	Common definitions

5.1.1	Introduction

This clause provides common definitions applicable to multiple DME types.

5.1.2	Identifiers and Metadata

5.1.2.1	DME type identifier

A DME type is identified by an identifier defined as dmeTypeId in R1AP [1], clause B.4.2. The DME type identifier consists of a namespace, name and a version.

5.1.2.2		Data category

A DME type shall be assigned to at least one data category. Assigned data category values can be used as query parameter when searching for available DME types as specified in R1AP [1] .

5.1.3	Versioning of DME types

When updating a DME type, the version in the DME type identifier (see clause 5.1.2.1) is updated according to SemVer [4] to reflect its compatibility with other DME types that have the same namespace and name.

Two DME types with the same namespace and name are incompatible if the major version digit in the version is different.

Two DME types are only considered to be identical if all three of their attribute’s namespace, name and version are identical.

The version in the DME type identifier includes a pre-release version (e.g., “-alpha.1”) if the definition of a DME type is under development.

5.1.4	Schemas for DME types

5.1.4.1 General

The definition of a DME type is based on two schemas, a data production schema and a data delivery schema.

5.1.4.2	Data production schema

The data production schema defines the structure for how to formulate parameters for the production of data instances of a DME type by a data job or a data offer. A data production schema can be based on data types defined in other specifications.

Table 5.1.4.2-1 defines the attributes of the data production schema.

5.1.4.3	Data delivery schema

The data delivery schema defines the structure of the delivered content resulting from the related data job or data offer. A data delivery schema can be based on data types defined in other specifications The data delivery schema type is defined in R1AP [1].

A DME type can be defined with one or more data delivery schemas each based on different schema technologies such as for example JSON schema [6]  and XSD [7], [8], [9] and [i.1].

The definition of a DME type follows a template that includes but is not limited to:

the declaration of a DME type identifier,

the assignment of a data category,

the definition of the data types needed for the data production schema (in terms of data selector, target selector, timing and optionally further types) and the data delivery schema or schemas,

the definition of the data production schema and data delivery schema or schemas.

5.2.2	DME type: RAN OAM PM data
