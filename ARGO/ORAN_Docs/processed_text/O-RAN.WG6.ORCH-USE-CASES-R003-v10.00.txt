Context and Relationship to other WG6 and O-RAN Work
This document introduces different use cases for O-RAN orchestration of virtualized RAN and the interfaces used for management and orchestration, in particular the O1 interface between the service management and orchestration framework and the RAN managed functions and the O2 interface between the service management and orchestration framework and the O-Cloud Infrastructure Management Services/Deployment Management Services that controls resource assignment for Virtualized Network Functions.
This document relies on WG1 architecture documents for the overall architecture.  WG6 focuses on end-to-end orchestration in O-RAN and virtualization/cloudification of O-RAN functions.
The following documents are used as input on high level O-RAN OAM architecture and functions:
WG1 O-RAN architecture [3]
WG10 OAM architecture [5]
WG10 OAM interface specification (O1) [6]
In addition, the WG6 CADS specification [7] is referenced for input on cloud architecture and terminology, and the WG6 O2 General Aspects and Principles [9] is referenced for details of the O2 interface and its usage
The details of implementing orchestration interfaces and models are covered in follow on documents, such as are shown in purple in Figure 2-1.
NOTE:	Work on AAL[11] may lead to additional use cases in future.
Figure 2-1:  Relationship of this Document to Scenario Documents and O-RAN Management Documents
This document also draws on work from other O-RAN working groups such as WG2 for Non-RT RIC details and WG3 for Near-RT RIC and xAPP details, as well as sources from other industry bodies.
Objectives of this Document
The O-RAN ALLIANCE seeks to improve RAN flexibility and deployment velocity, while at the same time reducing the capital and operating costs through the adoption of cloud-based architectures.
A key principle is the decoupling of RAN hardware and software for all components including O-CU, O-DU, and O-RU, and the deployment of software components on commodity server architectures supplemented with programmable accelerators where necessary.
Given that the RAN environment will consist of a range of different components that can be realized by either PNFs or VNFs/CNFs it is critical to understand the coordination of RAN components done by the Service Management and Orchestration Framework to deploy and operate RAN services in an O-RAN architecture.
This document defines end-to-end use cases in clause 3 and specifies OAM-related general and interface requirements in clause 4 to support the O-RAN architecture.
Relationship to O-RAN OAM Architecture
This document follows the high-level O-RAN OAM Architecture defined in O-RAN WG10.  The high-level OAM Architecture is given below in Figure 2-2 as taken from [3] but focusing on OAM interfaces O1 and O2 only.
Figure 2-2:  O-RAN Architecture and Management Interfaces
The Use Cases in this document describe the use of the O1 and O2 interfaces for orchestration within an O-RAN.
Functional Description of O-RAN Cloud Infrastructure
This document uses terminology for O-Cloud components taken from the Cloud Architecture and Deployment Scenarios for O-RAN virtualized RAN Specification [7], and O2 General Aspects and Principles [9], including the O-Cloud Node, IMS and DMS.
Orchestration Use Cases
These Use Cases focus on the private cloud case where the cloud is managed by the operator.  Applicability to the public cloud case is for further study.
The present document provides Use Cases related to Network Function, O-Cloud, SMO and Near-RT RIC.  At a high level, the use cases cover similar functionality/scope applicable to O-Cloud and O-Cloud-based Network Functions, such as:
Instantiation and deployment of O-Cloud and Network Functions
Updating of O-Cloud and Network Functions
Scaling of O-Cloud and Network Functions
Instantiation and deployment of O-Cloud in the O-RAN is triggered by the “Service Request” from SMO and a sequential process involving the use cases described in clauses 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3. The instantiation of Network Function is described in clause 3.2.1.
Updating of O-Cloud and Network Function can be performed independently and be triggered by the SMO as described in clauses 3.1.6 and 3.2.4, respectively.
Scaling of Network Function is triggered by the SMO as described in clause 3.2.2 (for the scaling out) and clause 3.2.3 (for the scaling in). Scaling of O-Cloud is described in clause 3.1.5.
The roles and actors described in Table 3-1 are used in the use case descriptions.
Table 3-1: Description of actors and roles used in the use cases.
NOTE 1: The UML® Sequence Diagrams in the use cases follow the template defined in the OAM Architecture [5] Appendix B.  An arrow with dashed lines is used to indicate a synchronous return message.
NOTE 2: UML® is a registered trademark of the Object Management Group, in the United States and other countries. O-RAN is not affiliated with, endorsed or sponsored by the Object Management Group.
There might be various situations where the IMS software or its data store itself has become corrupt. In this situation, the IMS as a producer entity might not be able to perform its functions over the O2ims interface. This problem applies to all the following use cases. Ways or strategies of how to recover or react to a non-functional IMS will be covered in the Loss of O2ims of Management Link Use Case [NOTE 3: use case to be added in future].
For all the following use cases, there are common messaging framework errors and exceptions that can occur. For example, if a response message is never received because of a network outage, it is expected that eventually the system will time out. These standard code responses will apply to all the following use cases and are not mentioned explicitly as separate exceptions within the use cases.
For all the following use cases, it is possible that the IMS is processing a request while another new request operating on the same objects arrives from the same or another authorized entity. This is a race condition. A race condition can occur either at the management level (SMO), or at the transaction level (O2ims or O2dms Interface). For example, a PM subscription query request is being processed by the IMS and while the IMS is processing that operation, a new PM subscription query request arrives. NOTE 4: This would be resolved in the management implementation (SMO) or in the stage 3 (O2ims or O2dms interface) implementation. Some possible solution implementations are a semaphore flag (managing entity side) that only allows one entity to access the resources at a time. Another possible implementation is a “currency” field that would be a token mechanism that can be used to identify transactions.
O-Cloud Basic Use Cases
Cloud Platforms are identified in order for the SMO to take advantage of them. In traditional data center clouds these have been manually or externally added to the SMO for homing of NF deployments since the numbers are typically low from hundreds of cloud regions to even several thousand. However, in the case of edge clouds the number of deployments scale into the 10K to 100K range, in which case this process needs to more closely resemble the way RAN elements are “discovered”. Even in this latter case, the rationale for edge clouds is for specific performance requirements, therefore not all edge clouds are equivalent. This Use Case describes how the SMO discovers and manages a cloud implementation that meets the O-RAN specifications as described in the Cloud Architecture and Deployment Scenarios for O-RAN virtualized RAN [7]. Such a cloud instance is generally referred to as an O-Cloud which is comprised of O-Cloud Nodes (Compute, Storage, and Network), dedicated resources for the O-Cloud.
This group of Use Cases includes the following:
Pre-processing where before the O-Cloud is activated the SMO is configured with the identity of the O-Cloud so that registration can be done
Basic platform software installation by the SMO and IMS
O-Cloud deployment processing where the O-Cloud registers with SMO and has its identity and software version checked
Capabilities Exchange where the SMO either queries for O-Cloud capabilities or is notified autonomously that there has been a change in O-Cloud capabilities
O-Cloud hardware upgrade where a new O-Cloud Node is added
O-Cloud software update where the platform software version is upgraded or downgraded in the O-Cloud
The end result of the group of use cases is an active O-Cloud registered with SMO and ready for the deployment of Network Functions.
NOTE 1:	Where Personnel are shown as part of the Use Case, the roles and terminology used are given for purposes of illustration only.
NOTE 2: 	Regarding security and authentication of an entity that interacts with the IMS, which typically the FOCOM in the SMO, the topic of security and authentication will be addressed by the O-RAN security focus group (SFG). A common solution which affects all the following use cases will be studied and specified by the SFG. This is currently FFS. When these are better understood, each of the following use cases will be updated to reflect the security & authentication requirements.
O-Cloud Pre-Deployment Processing Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case describes the SMO being configured to add an O-Cloud into its inventory prior to the O-Cloud itself being activated and attempting to register with the SMO.
The Use Case assumes that this will be part of a sequence of “Service Requests” to the SMO, one for the deployment of the O-Cloud and one for the Network Function(s) that will run on that O-Cloud instance.  In the latter request, information is assumed to be present on the NF Service Requests to identify the O-Cloud instance, as described in a later Use Case.
NOTE:	In some cases, there could potentially be a single “Service Request” to SMO containing information about both the O-Cloud and Network Function(s) that will run on that O-Cloud instance, but this is not covered in the Use Case.

Figure 3-1: O-Cloud Pre-Deployment Processing
O-Cloud Platform Software Installation Use Case
High Level Description
The Use Case describes the deployment of the O-Cloud and installation of O-Cloud Platform Software on an O-Cloud Node.  The Cloud Installer begins the installation by installing the hardware for the O-Cloud Nodes and notifying SMO to begin Cloud Build.  SMO then loads O-Cloud Platform Software on a first O-Cloud Node in the O-Cloud, which then brings up any additional O-Cloud Nodes in the O-Cloud.
During activation of other O-Cloud Nodes, the O-Cloud Management Plane activates IMS, which then notifies the SMO of its availability.  The SMO then sends IMS the required set of O-Cloud Node Roles and Personalities to support.  The IMS loads necessary basic software for O-Cloud onto the other O-Cloud Nodes and also configures and activates one or more DMSs.
It is assumed that hardware to deploy O-Cloud Management Software is pre-configured and ready. Network connectivity between O-Cloud network gateways(s) and SMO is assumed to be ready, as per the “O-Cloud Pre-Deployment Processing Use Case” described in clause 3.1.1.
For O-Cloud resources managed by a Hardware Accelerator Manager (HAM), which is defined in O-RAN WG6.AAL-GAnP [11], Clause 3.1, the IMS informs the HAM what SW artifacts to be installed and activated for HWA resources managed by that HAM. The HAM is responsible for obtaining, installing and activating the SW artifacts. For further information, see O-RAN WG6.AAL-GAnP [11], Clause 4.2.1.

O-Cloud Registration and Initialization Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case describes the sequence for registration and initialization of the newly deployed O-Cloud.  The SMO queries the O-Cloud for its SW inventory, checks to see if this requires any updates, configures the O-Cloud and queries the O-Cloud for available DMS.  Following this sequence, the O-Cloud is available for NF deployments to be instantiated.
Sequence Description

Figure 3-3: O-Cloud Deployment Processing
O-Cloud Inventory Update Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case describes the procedure for the SMO and O-Cloud to update inventory information about its type and current capabilities using O2 Infrastructure Inventory Services [9], including resource build configurations (aka “flavors”), capacity, utilization and availability.  This procedure is invoked initially at deployment of the O-Cloud and can be invoked at later times to identify changes in the capabilities of the O-Cloud. Two patterns are possible, one using query/response from the SMO in order to get current inventory, e.g., before instantiating a new NF deployment and one triggered by autonomous indications from the O-Cloud when there has been a change in inventory status.

Hardware Infrastructure Scaling of O-Cloud Post Deployment
High Level Description
After the initial deployment of an O-Cloud, it may be necessary to scale up resources. In this use case, we examine how the SMO will discover and manage a new O-Cloud Node that has been cabled and powered up to be part of an existing O-Cloud.
Sequence Description

Figure 3-5: Hardware Infrastructure Scaling
O-Cloud Platform Software Update Use Case
High Level Description
Edge clouds deployments can range in the 10K to 100K range across an operator network. Rolling O-Cloud software updates (upgrades and downgrades) need to be performed without service disruption for both VM and container-based workloads. Across a region, it may be necessary to update all edge O-Clouds in a serial fashion in order to minimize potential disruptions or in a parallel fashion where a set amount of edge O-Clouds in a region are simultaneously updated. Compute and storage nodes of individual edge O-Clouds can also be updated in a serial or parallel hitless fashion. Within an individual O-Cloud, the IMS migrates Network Function deployments from the affected O-Cloud Nodes before the software update in order to avoid service disruption (in this use case, it is assumed that IMS does this autonomously).  From an SMO perspective, offloading the update strategy of an edge O-Cloud to a regional and local controller substantially reduces the update complexity.
Fault handling of an O-Cloud update is critical. Individual nodes can fail during the update process and may need to be replaced. Rolling back of the update prior to a successful completion shall also be supported.
In this use case, we examine how the SMO will update a single O-Cloud.  It is assumed that the software update does not affect the IMS itself, and that the IMS is capable of performing the software update and migrating NF deployments from the affected O-Cloud Nodes without affecting active services.
For O-Cloud resources managed by a Hardware Accelerator Manager (HAM), which is defined in O-RAN WG6.AAL-GAnP [11], Clause 3.1, the IMS informs the HAM what SW artifacts to be updated for HWA resources managed by that HAM. The HAM is responsible for obtaining and updating the SW artifacts. For further information, see O-RAN WG6.AAL-GAnP [11], Clause 4.2.1.

Functional Status Query Use Case
High Level Description
The purpose of the functional status query use case is to allow for the request of state and status information from the O-Cloud. Standardized state and status information can be found in ITU-T X.731 (see reference [15]). While X.731 concepts originate in a wireless RAN context, they are useful and applicable to the management and reporting of O-Cloud resources.
NOTE 1: For an operator to indicate something is in maintenance, the Administrative State Attribute (from X.731) values of “locked” and “shutting down” could be used.
NOTE 2: For an operator to indicate something is undergoing test, the Availability Status attribute (X.731) “in test” and the Control Status Attribute (X.731) “subject to test” and “reserved for test” could be used.
For example, an operator wants to see that things are “healthy” and operating with no faults. They could issue a functional status query on the O-Cloud; and the query would return an operational state of “enabled” with no alarm status of “alarm outstanding” for all resources.

Query Information Use Case
High Level Description
This is an O-Cloud basic use case that governs the behavior and flow for getting readable attributes of objects in the O2 Information Model by a qualified entity. The entity would usually be the SMO or O-Cloud Operator; however, it could also be another authorized user/technician, or authorized management function. The Query Information Use Case enables an authorized consumer to query and retrieve various information related to the O-Cloud infrastructure and its resources.
The Query filter identifies a set of objects of interest for the Query operation. If no filter is given with the Query, then all objects are qualified, and the Query would return information on all objects. The attribute selector within the Query request is used to indicate the attributes that are of interest from the set of objects identified in the filter. If no attribute selector is specified, then the Query response returns all information of the qualified objects given in the filter.
NOTE: The Query operation could return attributes of the Read/Write property that is read-only, read & write but not write-only.
There are existing Query use cases in this document that act on specific objects in the information model. This Query Information use case describes the overall behavior applicable to query use cases.

Network Function Basic Use Cases
Instantiate Network Function on O-Cloud
High Level Description
NOTE 1:	This use case is described as an NF level procedure. The SMO to O-Cloud interaction is at the level of NF Deployment rather than NF level.
This Use Case describes the instantiation of a Cloud-Native Network Function as a new deployment on an O-Cloud, and notification to the SMO once the instantiation of resources for the Network Function deployment has been completed.
The following Use Case adopts terms from the high-level model described in Clause 4 of the OAM Architecture [5]. For definition purposes the terms adopted are defined below. However, if the definition is in conflict with the OAM Architecture, then the OAM Architecture will supersede these definitions.
DeploymentDescriptor:	The Deployment Descriptor describes a deployment option that has been validated by the Solution Provider of the application.
DeploymentItem:	The Deployment Item describes a complete deployment of an application or part of an application. A Deployment Descriptor can include one or more Deployment Items. Each Deployment Item describes the Cloud Requirements (Capabilities and Capacities) that are needed for the deployment to be successful. It may include references to Executable Images and Cloud Native Descriptor Files which are sent to the Cloud where the deployment is expected to occur.
CloudNativeDescriptorFile:	The Cloud Native Descriptor File is an artifact which is intended to be opaque to the SMO and sent via the O2dms that meets the specified cloud capabilities identified in the DeploymentItem.
ExecutableImage:	The Executable Image is an artifact which is intended to be deployed into the O-Cloud, this could be a docker image, or any other binary image such as a bitstream used to configure an accelerator.
NOTE 2:	The instantiation on the O-Cloud Node may be part of a larger procedure instantiating multiple connected Network Functions, in which case the SMO will coordinate the timing of instantiation across O-Clouds and O-Cloud Nodes, the configuration of transport needed between O-Cloud Nodes and other requirements such as addressing and security used for connecting the Network Functions as below. Instantiation of multiple connected NFs is not addressed in the use case.

Scale Out of NF
High Level Description
NOTE 1:	This use case is described as an NF level procedure. The SMO to O-Cloud interaction is at the level of NF Deployment rather than NF level.
This Use Case describes how to instantiate additional resources for NF deployments in order to expand the capacity of an NF. This results in horizontal elasticity and allows the NF to consume the resources it needs based on the level of demand based on network traffic.
NOTE 2:	In this use case, scaling is managed by the SMO.  Self-management of scaling by the NF is for future study.

High Level Description
NOTE:	This use case is described as an NF level procedure. The SMO to O-Cloud interaction is at the level of NF Deployment rather than NF level.
This Use Case describes how to delete NF deployments to reduce the capacity of an O-Cloud-based ME realizing an O-RAN NF, to improve efficiency. This supports horizontal elasticity and allows the NF to consume only the resources it needs based on the level of demand based on network traffic.

Software Upgrade of NF
High Level Description
NOTE:	This use case is described as an NF level procedure. The SMO to O-Cloud interaction is at the level of NF Deployment rather than NF level.
This Use Case describes SMO-managed upgrade to the software of the Network Function. This covers the software deployment and its activation.  Once activated the NF is configured by SMO similar to the NF deployment use case.
This use case illustrates the build-and-replace NF software upgrade approach.  This approach utilizes a graceful or soft upgrade where the old NF is not deleted until this can be done without disrupting existing traffic it supports. Other approaches could be developed specific to containerization such as break-fix, or the PNF form of Upgrade-in-place.  More complex scenarios such as support of zero traffic loss may be explored in future versions.

Near-RT RIC/xAPP Use Cases
Configure O-Cloud for Near-RT RIC
High Level Description
This Use Case defines an optional procedure using Custom Resources to configure a Kubernetes O-Cloud to support the Near-RT RIC function by using, as an example, the Kubernetes® Custom Resource Definitions (CRD).
NOTE 1:	Similar procedure may be used for O-Cloud configuration for other functions as well.
NOTE 2: Kubernetes® and K8s® are registered trademarks of the Linux Foundation, in the United States and other countries. O-RAN is not affiliated with, endorsed or sponsored by the Linux Foundation.
The Near-RT RIC may require a Custom Resource to ensure proper lifecycle management of the near-RT RIC and its xAPPs. This capability has to be added to the O-Cloud prior to a near-RT RIC service deployment. There are multiple ways to add a custom resource. For example, Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) is easier and requires no programming. Another possibility is to use API Aggregation which requires programming but is more flexible in terms of API behaviors. Both options require a "service" in Kubernetes to be deployed. The following example illustrates the CRD initial installation.

A Use Case description of multi-vendor provisioning of an O-RAN service can be found in the O-RAN OAM Architecture specification [5].
Reconfiguration of O-RAN Virtual Network Function(s)
High Level Description
A common orchestration request is the reconfiguration of one or a set of cloud-based O-RAN Virtual Network Functions in order to affect the behavior of the RAN.  The action taken could be, for example, to re-optimize network traffic patterns or update the load balancing of traffic across the RAN network.  The trigger for this action could be any number of events such as non-real time traffic analysis by the Non-RT RIC, or input from non-RAN sources such as upcoming natural events or scheduled human events.
In such cases the SMO will either be told or determine by its own analysis which Virtual Network Functions need reconfiguration and in which order this is done if multiple Virtual Network Functions are involved.  If a problem develops during reconfiguration then SMO may optionally invoke a fallback procedure to revert the Virtual Network Functions to their original configuration.  As in reconfiguration of PNFs, O1 Interface [6] Provisioning Management is used.
NOTE:	There may be a need for SMO to initially reroute traffic away from the affected Virtual Network Functions and subsequently revert traffic to the original patterns.  This could be done by using Network Function Reconfiguration on adjacent Network Functions that send or receive information from the affected Network Functions.

Recovery Use Cases
Introduction
When an operator experiences problems with an O-Cloud NF Deployment(s), O-Cloud Node(s), or O-Cloud instance, it is possible for the operator to initiate a recovery at different levels of the O-Cloud.
These can include the following:
Application-level healing
This causes an application within an NF on the O-Cloud to be healed on operator request, and is accomplished through the O1 interface between SMO and the associated NF. Typically, the network operator tries to execute the Application level healing as part of recovering from NF’s application failures via O1.
The Application level healing is out of scope of the present document since it is foreseen that the interactions are only on the O1 interface.
NF Deployment level healing (refer to clause 3.6.2)
Another level of healing is by acting upon the NF Deployments (e.g., workloads in Kubernetes case) that realize an NF instance, where either the network operator can execute the NF Deployment level healing  via O2dms, or the O-Cloud internal deployment management functions can execute built-in or configured procedures for auto-healing of the NF Deployment, e.g., based on workload monitoring in O-Cloud.
When the healing of an NF Deployment within an O-Cloud is triggered via an operator request, it is accomplished through the O2dms interface between SMO and the DMS responsible for the deployment management services of the NF Deployment of concern.
In the case of auto-healing, the DMS may automatically trigger healing of the NF Deployment, where no operator request over O2dms interface is necessary.
O-Cloud Node level healing (refer to clause 3.6.3)
This causes one or more O-Cloud Nodes within an O-Cloud to be healed on operator request, and is accomplished through the O2ims interface between SMO and the IMS responsible for infrastructure management services for that O-Cloud Node. This can be used as part of recovery of the resources within the O-Cloud, i.e., the O-Cloud Node level healing. It is also possible that IMS executes built-in or configured procedures for auto-healing of the O-Cloud Node.  This level of healing needs extra trigger considerations because it can affect multiple NFs running on the O-Cloud Node(s). For instance, "draining" the O-Cloud Node (i.e., migrating the NF deployments out from the affected O-Cloud Node) and/or setting the O-Cloud Node into maintenance mode can be done before requesting the O-Cloud Node healing. Related NF deployment requirements from the NF deployment descriptor and cloud native descriptors that are available to the O-Cloud DMS are taken into consideration as part of the O-Cloud Node healing (e.g., graceful evacuation of Pods based on Pod disruption budgets set for that NF).
In the case of auto-healing, the IMS may automatically trigger healing of the O-Cloud Node, where no operator requires over O2ims interface is necessary.
O-Cloud instance level healing
This causes an O-Cloud instance to be healed on operator request.  This last level of healing, i.e., O-Cloud instance level healing, can be seen as a last resort action and it needs extra trigger considerations because it can affect multiple NFs and O-Cloud Nodes residing in the O-Cloud instance.
Editor’s Note: It is for further study whether this can be accomplished through the O2 interface.
The ordering or which one of the healings to use or execute is up to network operator policies, e.g., in some cases a cascading might be tried, while in other cases the operator might decide to activate a specific healing without cascading among them.
For illustrative purposes, the following is explanation about typical system reset cases in legacy deployments. In legacy deployment cases, when the xNB experiences some issue at the software level, e.g., the software on the xNB is not responding to the operations of the remote management tool due to possible software failures, “physical hardware” level reset is performed to re-gain software level control. For performing this action, typically an OSS sends a “system reset” signal to the target xNB. This procedure is necessary to reset the system (CU and DU) in xNB without performing a “manual intervention” at the radio antenna site, e.g., “personnel pushing power button”. Figure 3-16 illustrates an example of remote system reset in the legacy deployment case.  System reset does not apply in exactly the same way for recovery of NF and O-Cloud systems but healing at different levels can be supported using O2 as described above.
Figure 3-20: Remote System Reset of legacy xNB by OSS
Network Function Deployment Level Healing Use Case
High Level Description
Depending on the O-Cloud technology, in some cases the capability of auto-healing of the NF deployments is available intrinsically in the O-Cloud platform. In that case, the NF deployment requirements from the NF deployment descriptors and cloud native descriptors are taken into account together with the runtime state of the NF Deployment in O-Cloud, to activate the NF Deployment auto-healing process.
When such O-Cloud DMS capability is not available or there is a need for an operator triggered recovery as one or more O-RAN NF(s) is (are) experimenting some failure, and the error could not be fixed by using the O1 interface services, then as a possible step, the network operator could trigger SMO to request the DMS to perform an NF Deployment level healing to attempt to fix the problem.
The healing of an NF Deployment may be performed via different means depending on the type of resources required for the NF Deployment (e.g., VM or container). For instance, both in VM-based and container-based NF Deployments, the capability to restart the VM or OS Container/Pod can be leveraged. The NF Deployment could be restarted (stop and start), or its associated resources be reallocated/replaced on the same or different O-Cloud Nodes.
NOTE:	Alternatively, if the O-Cloud cannot perform the healing, new NF Deployment instances can be created on O-Cloud Nodes with resources of equivalent characteristics and profile as defined in that NF deployment descriptors and cloud native descriptors. This can be performed in the context of service recovery, not a healing of a specific NF Deployment.
This use case describes the procedure to attempt to heal specific NF Deployments using the O2dms interface services.

O-Cloud Node Level Healing Use Case
High Level Description
Depending on the O-Cloud technology, in some cases the capability of auto-healing of the O-Cloud Nodes is available intrinsically in the O-Cloud platform.
When such O-Cloud IMS capability is not available or there is a need for an operator triggered recovery as one or more O-RAN NF(s) is (are) experiencing some failure, and the error could not be fixed by using the O1 or O2dms interface services, then as a possible step, the network operator could trigger SMO to request the IMS to perform an O-Cloud Node level healing to attempt to fix the problem. In addition, certain events received by SMO about malfunctioning O-Cloud Node resources could indicate or trigger the need to heal those resources, even in the case that such resource is not actually being allocated for running the whole or part of an O-RAN NF.
The healing of an O-Cloud Node may be performed via different means. For instance, the O-Cloud Node could be restarted (stop and start the node) or reallocated to use other O-Cloud Resources or O-Cloud Infrastructure resources.
This use case describes the procedure to attempt to heal specific O-Cloud Nodes using the O2ims interface services. This procedure can be invoked when some faults are identified that could be resolved by healing O-Cloud Nodes.

O-Cloud Node Backup Use Cases
Introduction
The use cases introduced in clause 3.6.4 concern about O-Cloud Node backup.
When an O-Cloud Node experiences some failure, the O-Cloud Node can be healed by restarting or reallocating the O-Cloud Node on other O-Cloud Resources, as described in the O-Cloud Node Level Healing Use Case, clause 3.6.3 of the present document. In order to reallocate an O-Cloud Node, information and current state data about the O-Cloud Node is necessary. This is referred in the following as "O-Cloud Node backup".
The O-Cloud Node backup might be automatically created by the O-Cloud based on certain policy or configuration. In other cases, O-Cloud Operator might explicitly request to create an O-Cloud Node backup.
The following set of use cases describe the procedure to create an O-Cloud Node backup initiated by O-Cloud Operator, SMO, or IMS based on backup criteria.
SMO can specify the information to backup within the O-Cloud Node Backup request. The specific items to backup for each O-Cloud Node could differ based on implementation, but in all cases, it needs to contain the necessary items for restoration and rollback. The followings are the examples of information and data to be backed up:
-	Running configurations of O-Cloud Node, or
-	O-Cloud inventory information (such as its type, capabilities, and resource build configurations, for example, a reference to the Initiation Configuration Set (ICS) that has been used for O-Cloud Node initialization) as described in O-Cloud Inventory Update Use Case, clause 3.1.4, or
-	O-Cloud blueprint of the functionality and resources as described in [REQ-ORC-GEN14].
It is useful to create a backup before update in order to be able to rollback to the original state in case of a failure during the update procedure. In addition to the backup before update, automatic or periodic backup is also useful to restore the latest information in case of unexpected failure of O-Cloud Node. The probable triggers to create an O-Cloud Node Backup are:
-	after initialization of new O-Cloud Node,
-	before software update on O-Cloud Node for rollback in case of update failure,
-	before reconfiguration of O-Cloud Node for fallback in case of problem during reconfiguration,
-	on a request from O-Cloud Operator,
-	periodical backup timer (done in case of unexpected failure of O-Cloud Node), and
-	automatic backup based on backup criteria configured on the IMS.
NOTE 1:	It is not a mandatory procedure to create a backup after O-Cloud Node initialization or before O-Cloud Node update.
SMO can configure the backup criteria on the IMS such as backup target, interval, threshold, and trigger for automatic/periodic backup.
O-Cloud Node backup can be initiated by the O-Cloud Operator and SMO. O-Cloud Node backup can be also initiated by IMS based on backup criteria. O-Cloud Operator can query the backup status of O-Cloud Node or backed-up O-Cloud Node information itself by using the O-Cloud Node Backup Query Use Case (see clause 3.6.4.4).
In the following, clause 3.6.4.2 describes the O-Cloud Node backup creation initiated by O-Cloud Operator or SMO. Clause 3.6.4.3 describes the backup criteria configuration on the IMS and O-Cloud Node backup creation based on the backup criteria. And finally, clause 3.6.4.4 describes the O-Cloud Node backup query.
NOTE 2:	O-Cloud Node backup request and O-Cloud Node backup criteria configuration by SMO provide the means to SMO and O-Cloud Operator to control the backup process considering aspects beyond the current status of the O-Cloud, e.g., network wide level management, etc. However, it is also possible that IMS can have pre-configured or perform by design O-Cloud Node backups by itself.
NOTE 3: The present use case considers only aspects of backup applied to O-Cloud Nodes. However, backup processes can also be applicable to other O-Cloud components and resources. How the use case could be further evolved or related to other use cases of backing up other O-Cloud components is not handled in the present document version, and it might be considered in future ones to realize a broader concept of O-Cloud Backup.
NOTE 4: Requirements for these use cases are for further study in future train.

Fault Use Cases
Alarm Subscription Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case supports IMS Alarm Event Subscription as described in ETSI Sol15 Clause 5.9 [12] as a pattern, 3GPP TS29.501-G50 [13].
An alarm subscription allows for one or more consumers to receive alarm event notifications. This is accomplished by the potential subscriber(s) issuing a subscription to the publisher of alarm events.
Sequence Description
UML sequence diagram
Figure 3-26: Alarm Subscription
Alarm Notification Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case supports Alarm Notification(s) by the alarm publisher (IMS).  A condition occurs on an O-Cloud resource which causes the current alarm list to change. This triggers an evaluation of the alarm subscription criteria by the publisher (IMS). If deemed relevant by the subscription criteria, the alarm is sent to the subscription endpoint. The alarm is sent in an alarm notification which is an event that carries the details of these relevant alarms. Alarm notifications are sent from a publisher to subscriber(s). See the Alarm subscription use case for more details on Alarm subscriptions.
When the fault(s) that caused an alarm has been cleared, the IMS determines which alarm to be cleared, clears the alarm, logs the alarm clearance, and reports it to alarm subscriber (FOCOM).
Sequence Description

Alarm Query Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case supports Alarm Query (Alarm History) for O2ims. Alarm query allows for the SMO to query for specific kinds of alarms or groups of alarms based on the alarm query criteria. This is useful for an operator to investigate, track, or debug a system.

IMS Alarm Subscription Query Use Case
High Level Description
This use case is about the Management of Alarm Subscriptions; in particular, the query service operation. The create and delete of an Alarm Subscription is documented in separate use cases. This use case only concerns the query of an Alarm Subscription. Query (cf. query-response) and Read (cf. CRUD operations) are synonymous in this situation.
The query of an Alarm Subscription is the ability of an authorized entity to get the details of an Alarm Subscription including its criteria. An entity here would usually be the SMO or O-Cloud Operator; however, it could also be another authorized user/technician, or authorized management function. Typically, an entity would perform a subscription query to cross-check their alarm subscription. Though, it could also be utilized for management purposes as well.

IMS Alarm Subscription Delete Use Case
High Level Description
This use case is about the Management of Alarm Subscriptions; in particular, the delete service operation. The create and query of an Alarm Subscription is documented in separate use cases. This use case only concerns the delete of an Alarm Subscription.
The delete of an Alarm Subscription is the ability of an authorized entity to delete an Alarm Subscription at the IMS. It is also possible to delete all alarm subscriptions associated with the consumer subscription identifier.  An entity here would usually be the SMO; however, it could also be another authorized user/technician, or authorized management function.
There is no update operation for an Alarm Subscription. To accomplish an update, an entity would need to first delete a subscription and then create a subscription with the desired subscription criteria.
Any subscription operations that change a subscription shall be logged. Therefore, the delete and create of an alarm subscription shall also be logged. The logging occurs at the O-Cloud IMS.
Sequence Description

Figure 3-30: IMS Alarm Subscription Deletion
Alarm Synchronization Use Case
High Level Description
This use case is for Alarm Synchronization. This is a special case, though commonly employed situation, for Alarm Query.
Alarm Synchronization is an Alarm Query on all the alarms of interest. Synchronization is just an alarm query operation with a specific query for all alarm changes within a specific time frame.
The Alarm Synchronization result is the same as a “Get Alarm List” with the entire list requested.
Alarm synchronization may be performed on demand left up to the consumer when to issue the operation.
One example of where alarm synchronization would be used is a situation where the communication link between the client (such as the SMO) and source of truth (such as the O-Cloud) might become disconnected or disrupted. In this case, the client will want to synchronize with the source of truth after a connect is re-established.
A situation might arise such that during the time of disconnection between the O-Cloud and the management layer (FOCOM/SMO), an alarm appeared and was cleared. From the Alarm Query Use case: to get historical alarms, the cloud operator would just perform an alarm query with the appropriate criteria. For example, an alarm query with the criteria to request for all alarms with cleared status would return the historical alarms based on the retention policy of the alarm list. Thus, to perform an Alarm Synchronization for alarm with a long communication outage time an operator could perform this type of operation to synchronize historical alarm lists as well.
Sequence Description

Alarm Acknowledge/Clear Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case relates to Alarm Supervision. It is expected that some O-Cloud infrastructure resources can experience alarm conditions that need to be managed or cleared.
This use case is used for a management entity to acknowledge or request for alarm(s) to be cleared. It is also used for the IMS to clear alarm(s) autonomously. It is expected that some resources could have some alarms that can be manually cleared while other alarms would be automatically cleared.
Acknowledgement of alarms means that a resource type has defined alarms that may require further human intervention; and that the acknowledge function allows an entity to recognize that the condition exists, and that further action might need to be taken.
Some alarms, based on the resource type, may have alarms that can be manually cleared after they have been raised.
Sequence Description
UML Sequence Diagram
Figure 3-32: Alarm Acknowledge/Clear
Log Query
High Level Description
This use case describes log query. Logs could be queried by the SMO to the IMS via O2. A user, application, or entity can query for logs that are available in the Cloud: both O-Cloud (exposed /IMS) and Cloud Infrastructure. Any log kept in the Cloud infrastructure might be queried through a user interface client or file transfer client such as CLI, SSH2, SFTP; this would be implementation specific.
There are three basic kinds of logs that might be kept within the Cloud (both exposed O-Cloud and Cloud infrastructure):
ALARM LOGS – Alarm logs are a record of the alarms that have been raised by the IMS. The IMS keeps and produces an Alarm Log. It is expected that the IMS logs every alarm that it sends to the FOCOM (SMO). Faults are transformed into Alarms by the IMS. Alarm Logs are exposed in an O-Cloud to northbound entities.
FAULT LOGS – Faults are kept in the Cloud infrastructure. Faults are raised by a Cloud Infrastructure Resource. Faults are transformed into alarms by the IMS. Thus, not every fault is an alarm. Not all faults are necessarily logged, and the Cloud Infrastructure Resource may keep fault log(s). The creation and operation of Fault Logs is up to implementation. Disclaimer: some implementations could combine Fault and Debug logs together. Fault logs are not necessarily exposed to northbound entities.
DEBUG LOGS – The creation and operation of Debug Logs is up to implementation. They might be able to be turned off. The log level would typically be configurable (at the source, middle, and end user level). For example, a typical implementation may use syslog (defined in RFC5424 [21]) which defines a “log level” to show informational (most detail), trace, warnings, errors, to critical (least detail) messages. Disclaimer: some implementations could combine Fault logs and Debug logs together. Debug logs are not necessarily exposed to northbound entities.
OTHER LOGS – There may be other logs besides Alarm, Fault and Debug logs that might be kept in the O-Cloud. This would be left to implementation.
The conclusion of this use case may provide either:
Pull Case – A consumer retrieve the log(s) after being given an endpoint, or
Push Case – The producer gives a consumer log(s) that match input criteria.
Because this is left to implementation, this use case will address both types as alternate flows. For example, an endpoint might be an IP address, where a user, application, or entity could then use a file transfer client to get logs from. When it is an endpoint, it can have data related to the endpoint not just an IP address.
NOTE: the SMO will likely need to be able to inter-operate with different and sometimes legacy IMS implementations. It is expected that the SMO would need to be able to support both paradigms: one where the IMS returns Log Files from a Log Query request and another where the IMS returns an endpoint and then for the SMO to later fetch Log Files.

Figure 3-33: Log Query
Alarm Dictionary Discovery Use Case
High Level Description
When a new O-Cloud Resource Type is discovered in the O-Cloud infrastructure either on O-Cloud genesis or during run-time, the IMS would inform FOCOM (SMO) about that new Resource Type so that the appropriate corresponding alarm dictionary can be identified.  NOTE: every version of a Resource has its own Resource Type and thus an Alarm Dictionary associated with it.
It is expected that the SMO would have already onboarded the associated Resource Type before it is discovered by the O-Cloud infrastructure, as described in O2 IMS Specification [17]. The four situations where an alarm dictionary could be discovered are:
SOFTWARE UPDATE – A software update creates a new resource type with its attendant alarm dictionary in inventory. Existing resources can either remain pointing to the existing Resource Type or be software updated to the newly loaded Resource Type. Each Resource Type has its own unique alarm dictionary associated with it at the SMO.
QUERY & SYNCHRONIZATION – A query service may also result in the discovery of new Resource Types in the O-Cloud infrastructure. Additionally, the initial synchronization of the model between the O-Cloud and management system (SMO) may result in the discovery of Resource Types to be managed. Each Resource Type has its own unique alarm dictionary associated with it.
NEW RESOURCES ADDED – New objects have been added to the O-Cloud infrastructure. Subsequently, new Resource Types corresponding to those new objects may be added which then may result in an Infrastructure Inventory Event being generated to a consumer (FOCOM/SMO) or subscriber. Each Resource Type has its own unique alarm dictionary associated with it.
IMS LIFE CYCLE SOFTWARE UPDATE – When the software of the O-Cloud is updated new Resource Types can be discovered.
There are two possible ways the IMS gets the Alarm Dictionary. The SMO might update the IMS with the Alarm Dictionary. In another method, the IMS might get the Alarm Dictionary from the O-Cloud Resource (or external proxy for the resource). See the Resource Type Onboarding LCM Use Case for more details. The source of truth is in the cloud for Cloud Resource types.

Logging Management Use Case
High Level Description
The Logging Management use case defines how IMS administrates, provisions, and configures logging management for logs that reside in the O-Cloud generated by O-Cloud Resources. It is related to the Log Query (IMS) Use Case [see Clause 3.7.8 above] because it sets the behavior how IMS handles the management of logging that underpins the Log Query use case. This Use case will cover logging management. Some examples of logging management: the configuration of the retention period, the activation of logging, logging rotation of older logs (FIFO), and setting log levels.
Logging management can apply to all the various types of logs kept in the O-Cloud including Alarm, Fault and Debug logs. The direct logging management toward specific types of logs are implementation specific.
There are Cloud native implementations for storing logs produced from O-Cloud Infrastructure resources. O-Cloud Resources could be physical or logical (see [9]). The Logging management use case should apply to O-Cloud Resources in a uniform way but should also account for those Cloud specific implementations. For example, the use of logging level by the IMS may not have a perfect “mapping” to a log level from a O-Cloud Infrastructure resource’s log.
Sequence Description
UML Sequence Diagram
Figure 3-35: Logging Management
Alarm List Configuration Use Case
High Level Description
This use case describes how the Alarm List is configured through a service operation. The SMO, or an authorized entity can request to configure the behavior of Alarm List Management at the IMS.
Faults are errors that an O-Cloud infrastructure resource detects (and stores). The fault is sent to the IMS. The IMS performs the task of sending alarm notifications to an end user (SMO or subscribing entity) and mapping the incoming faults to alarms. The IMS keeps all the current alarms in an alarm list. The request to configure the Alarm List is sent from the FOCOM towards the IMS. The request has attributes which describe the Alarm List properties to be adjusted. The Retention Period of alarms and Extension attributes can be changed by the Alarm List Configuration operation. After the Retention Period expires, alarms in the alarm list would be purged or archived based on alarm policy. For example, the Alarm List configuration request could have an attribute to specify to Retention Period by the IMS for 72 hours. Another operation to configure the Alarm List behavior could adjust the optional value(s) in the Extension attribute list of the Alarm List. Additional extensions attributes in the Alarm List Configuration request could change other aspects of Alarm List Management behavior by the IMS. This would allow for implementation specific behavior. For example, an Alarm List extension attribute might cause certain types of alarms from a certain compute node resource to be purged or archived after a certain period of time or based on triggers. Other extension attributes might define overflow behavior, or alarm list composition handling.

Alarm Suppression Use Case
Introduction
This use case supports Alarm Suppression for O2ims. Alarm Suppression allows for the IMS to suppress alarm notification from the IMS to the SMO. This is useful to avoid alarm floods caused by disasters or maintenance work.
The suppression policy such as type of alarms to be suppressed can be configured with an Alarm Suppression request order. Other suppression criteria, such as suppression level, suppression period, and suppression deactivation policy, can be configured, too. The suppression timer and threshold to activate Alarm Suppression may be configured via an Alarm Suppression request order. The Alarm Suppression criteria can be configured by the SMO or the IMS itself.
The IMS can initiate Alarm Suppression autonomously, for example, in the situation where the O2ims link between the SMO and the IMS is overloaded and the SMO is unable to send the Alarm Suppression request via the O2ims link, or in the situation where there is a loss of communication on the O2ims link. SMO can deactivate the IMS-initiated Alarm Suppression. IMS can also deactivate the SMO-initiated Alarm Suppression.
This use case covers the four operations of Alarm Suppression, which are 
1) Activation of Alarm Suppression
2) Query of Alarm Suppression criteria and status
3) Update of Alarm Suppression criteria
4) Deactivation of Alarm Suppression
O-Cloud Operator or the SMO can initiate all of the four operations, Alarm Suppression Activation, Query, Update, and Deactivation. The IMS can initiate the three operations, Alarm Suppression Activation, Update, and Deactivation.
1. Alarm Suppression Activation
The Alarm Suppression Activation request is sent from the SMO to the IMS to activate Alarm Suppression. After processing the activation request, the IMS responds to the SMO with Alarm Suppression Activation status (success or failure). The IMS may include the configured Alarm Suppression criteria and status.
The IMS may also activate Alarm Suppression by configuring Alarm Suppression criteria autonomously. In that case, the activation of Alarm Suppression should be informed to the SMO with the configured Alarm Suppression criteria and status.
NOTE: If an alarm suppression timer or threshold is configured by Alarm Suppression Activation operation, the alarm suppression triggered by the timer or threshold needs to be notified to the SMO.
2. Alarm Suppression Query
The SMO can query the Alarm Suppression status (such as active/inactive) and criteria. The IMS responds to the request with the current Alarm Suppression criteria and status.
3. Alarm Suppression Update
The SMO can request to update the Alarm Suppression criteria. The Alarm Suppression Update request from the SMO to the IMS includes the order that describes how to change the Alarm Suppression criteria that the IMS keeps. After processing the update request, the IMS responds to the SMO with Alarm Suppression Update status (success or failure). The IMS may include the updated Alarm Suppression criteria and status.
The IMS may also update Alarm Suppression by updating Alarm Suppression criteria autonomously. In that case, the update of Alarm Suppression should be informed to the SMO with the updated Alarm Suppression criteria and status.
4. Alarm Suppression Deactivation
When the SMO sends an Alarm Suppression Deactivation request to the IMS, the IMS responds to the request with Alarm Suppression Deactivation status (success or failure).
The IMS may also deactivate Alarm Suppression by removing Alarm Suppression criteria. In that case, the deactivation of Alarm Suppression should be informed to the SMO.
Once the Alarm Suppression is deactivated, the SMO or IMS can trigger the Alarm Synchronization as documented in the Alarm Synchronization Use Case [see Clause 3.7.6] for the suppressed alarms to synchronize and reconcile the state of alarms between IMS and SMO.
NOTE: If an alarm suppression is deactivated by the suppression deactivation policy, the policy-based alarm suppression deactivation needs to be notified to the SMO.
How the IMS implements the Alarm Suppression is via the use of policies. How these policies are managed are described in the Alarm List Configuration Use Case [See 3.7.11].
Different kind of alarms could be raised with the same root cause by different entities. Some intelligence needs to identify a root cause of those alarms and correlate them. With such an alarm correlation, alarms can be suppressed efficiently.
NOTE: How to control the Alarm Suppression with some kind of intelligence is out of scope of this use case.
Section 3.7.12.2 describes the Operator/SMO-initiated Alarm Suppression Activation, Query, Update, and Deactivation. Section 3.7.12.3 describes the IMS-initiated Alarm Suppression Activation, Update, and Deactivation.
Operator/SMO-initiated Alarm Suppression
High Level Description
This use case supports the Operator/SMO-initiated Alarm Suppression. It allows for the SMO to request the IMS to suppress alarm notification, query the suppression criteria and status, update the suppression criteria, and deactivate alarm suppression.

Alarm Purge Use Case
High Level Description
The Alarm Purge Use case describes Purging of alarms. Alarms in the alarm list that are older than the Retention Period will be purged. This is the most basic situation, when an alarm in the alarm list is older than the Retention Period, the IMS automatically purges old inactive and acknowledged cleared alarms.
From the Alarm List Configuration use case (see Clause 3.7.11), after the Retention Period expires, alarms in the Alarm List would be purged based on alarm policy. For example, the Retention Period might cause certain types of alarms from a certain Compute Node resource to be purged after a certain period or based on triggers.
This Use Case also describes the forced Purge of alarms requested by the O-Cloud Operator. In this case, alarms to be purged are removed from the Alarm List irrespective of the Retention Period. See RFC 8632 [22] for related specifications. Only inactive alarms or acknowledged active alarms can be purged.
NOTE 1: A forced Purge of alarms might be used if the storage capacity for the Alarm List approaches or is at capacity; and an operator wants to remove (warning and minor) alarms from the Alarm List to free up space.
NOTE 2: If an alarm condition persists after the original alarm is purged that it will reappear as a new alarm (spurred from that same condition) in the Alarm List.

Performance Use Cases
Performance Management Job Creation Use Case
High Level Description
A Performance Management (PM) Job is a task for collecting measurements and metrics related to O-Cloud Resources. It is the central entity for coordinating performance management activities. The IMS collects metrics and measurements from O-Cloud Resource(s). The PM Job is created in the IMS.
NOTE: The term “PM Job” is a widely used telecommunications industry term. See the GA&P for more details.
This use case describes:
(1) The creation of PM Job(s)
(2) The collection and processing of measurement data from O-Cloud Resource(s) tasked by the PM job. Note: processing entails operations such as the conversion of counters from one form to another, storage of data, scraping data from one format to another.

Performance Measurement Subscription Use Case
High Level Description
This use case describes the flow for an entity to subscribe to Performance measurements data from an O-Cloud. PM jobs collect and compose measurements. The subscription determines when and how those are reported. The subscription allows a subscriber to get data that has been collected in the O-Cloud. Once subscribed, the Performance Measurement data is sent to a performance measurement subscriber, an entity north-bound of the O-Cloud. In the O-RAN context, it is the SMO; however, it could be another other subscribing entity.
Figure 3-41: PM Data and PM Subscription
The Figure above shows the basic flow of Performance Data collection and subscription. Measurement and telemetry data is collected within the O-Cloud and gathered by PM Job(s) and stored locally. The Performance Subscription Manager within the IMS can retrieve the data to be sent to the SMO. There is a publisher and subscriber notification end point that is used to send the performance data to that is defined in the subscription. Measurement reports are composed at the Performance Subscription Manager within the IMS and can then be used to perform analysis on within the SMO.
Performance measurements in an O-Cloud might use event notification reporting, stream-based reporting, or file-based reporting to a subscriber. For performance measurements to be sent, a subscription needs to be created. The subscription indicates an end point for where the performance measurements should be sent to. The subscription filter qualifies what data from the PM jobs should be sent.
The subscription will indicate the interval. A capabilities exchange could occur between the SMO and the O-Cloud indicating the mechanism and formats supported by the O-Cloud. The SMO can then subscribe to the mechanisms and formats within the subscription filter. In the capabilities exchange, the IMS would report the jobs and their collection intervals.
Sequence Description

Figure 3-42: PM Subscription
Performance Notification Reporting Use Case
High Level Description
In the context of O-RAN Cloud managed systems, performance measurements can be transmitted by one of three mechanisms: event notification(s), streaming based reporting, or file-based reporting. The performance measurement subscription use case defined the service connection end point where the events are sent to in the subscription filter.
EVENT NOTIFICATIONS – Event based reporting would send individual events to a subscriber and a connection is opened each time a notification is to be sent. Non-real time performance measurements could use event-notification reporting mechanisms.
STREAMING BASED REPORTING – Streaming is typically used for a continuous session to send performance measurement data. For streaming, the connection is opened and kept open without having to renegotiate.
FILE REPORTING – Off-line, or non-real time performance measurements could use file-based or event-notification reporting mechanisms.
The SMO is expected to support all three of the above mechanisms. However, any given IMS (O-Cloud) implementation may not support all three.
This use case will cover performance event notification reporting to send performance data. An entity that subscribes to these performance event notifications will get an event or callback invoked for each reporting message.
Notification reports are based on a subscription. The performance subscription determines three things:
REPORTING FREQUENCY – The subscription filter indicates the reporting frequency when data is included in a report. The subscription filter establishes the trigger mechanism during the subscription which that trigger when the callback would be invoked.
METHOD & FORMAT – The method & format are specified in the subscription filter. The method of delivery is event notifications, streaming based reporting, or file reporting mechanisms. The format being the encoding scheme used for the payload. Formats will be defined in the data model.
ITEMS TO REPORT - It is expected each criterion define: a list of PM jobs and their lists of measures that are of interest to report.
Event based notification would be utilized for low frequency and low volume of reporting since a session is re-established with the sending of each event. At higher data volumes a continuous session would be more efficient. See the streaming reporting use case for more details.
There are three basic exception cases:
CONNECTION LOST – If connectivity between the subscriber and the publisher (IMS) is lost, a connection would not be able to be opened. There are implementation considerations such as: how long data is held for, recovery of the connection, backing up data, preventing data storms upon recovery, and management after recovery.
DATA UNAVAILABLE – This exception occurs when the performance measurement data is not available in the O-Cloud on the IMS when it should be reported. This results in a missed timing window when data was expected, but it was not available. In the interface, it would be expected a response would indicate data was unavailable. For example, in a RESTful interface an “404” would indicate this exception. There are implementation considerations such as: O-Cloud failures, IMS failures, data recovery, and data synchronization.
PM JOB FAILURES & ISSUES – If the PM Job is unable to perform its function. If there are failures or issues with the PM Job(s) which might result in data being unavailable it is expected that there would alarms that would be raised by the IMS. This results in data being unavailable.

Performance Measurement Streaming Reporting Use Case
High Level Description
In the context of O-RAN Cloud managed systems, performance measurements can be transmitted by one of three mechanisms: active collection by a consumer, active push by a producer (e.g. streaming-based reporting), and/or file-based reporting. The performance measurement subscription use case defines the service connection end point where the events are sent to in the subscription filter. Both active push and active collection have similar purposes, but the active control is with either the producer or consumer.
ACTIVE PUSH BY A PRODUCER – A producer (IMS) could send performance data through pushing data to a consumer. At least two options may be identified:
STREAMING – First is where a connection between consumer & producer persists between the data reports which is like 3GPP streaming reporting (3GPP TS28.532 Clause 11.5). For streaming, the connection is typically opened and kept open without having to renegotiate. Streaming is used to send a flow of performance measurement data bursts. Once the WebSocket is opened, the meta-data about the streams is exchanged, the consumer can then receive the serialized data. The point is that meta-data does not need to be exchanged with every data burst.
EVENT NOTIFICATIONS – The second option is by event notifications, where a new connection is reestablished between a consumer and producer for each data reporting. This is like how 5GC SBA works (3GPP TS23.501, TS23.502 services). The data is sent as a payload of a notification. The major difference is in the overhead associated with the notification because even to report a small amount data requires the header and establishing a connection.
ACTIVE COLLECTION BY A CONSUMER – The consumer could also actively collect data from a producer.
CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT READ ONLY ATTRIBUTES – Reuse of configuration management approach where attribute conveying the value of performance data is read by the consumer like any other configuration management attribute.
DATA SCRAPING – Use of data scraping common to cloud native implementations where a collector reads the data from a pre-defined URI.
FILE BASED REPORTING – File based reporting is not used for real-time, historically it is used for low-priority or background collection for large amounts of performance data. The file-based reporting has potential options: file upload by the producer and file download by the consumer following a file ready notification.
FILE UPLOAD BY PRODUCER – There is not an artificial delay, the data is reported whenever it is available. The shortfall is that it involves action by the producer.
FILE DOWNLOAD BY CONSUMER – It removes the burden from the producer, but may rely upon either periodic polling, or notification from the producer about the data being ready for download. The latter case is how 3GPP file-based reporting working in 3GPP TS28.532 Clause 11.6; and ETSI ISG NFV specifications (IFA008, IFA013).
The SMO is expected to support all three of the above mechanisms. However, any given IMS (O-Cloud) implementation may not support all three.
To stream performance measurements, a connection session is established between the IMS as a publisher and a subscriber (FOCOM at the SMO).  While the connection persists, performance data would be transmitted while it matches the subscription filter.
Performance Data is sent to the subscriber endpoint based on the subscription filter. The PM jobs collect performance data and store it locally. When the subscription indicates when data would be sent, the Performance Subscription Manager (PSM) within the IMS retrieves data. Then, the PSM formats it and sends it in a notification event in a stream. Thus, streaming-based reporting sends performance data to a subscriber endpoint based on a subscription. The subscription filter may give an interval or specify a trigger. Each element may have a criterion that determines when it is sent.

Performance Measurement File Reporting Use Case
High Level Description
In the context of O-RAN Cloud managed systems, performance measurements can be transmitted by one of three mechanisms: active collection by a consumer, active push by a producer (e.g. streaming-based reporting), and/or file-based reporting.
The SMO is expected to support all three of the above mechanisms. However, any given IMS (O-Cloud) implementation may not support all three.
File based reporting has two cases:
File Upload by Producer (Push) – In a file upload case, the Performance Subscription Manager (PSM) within the IMS determines that data would be sent. Then, the PSM fetches the data, bundles it into a file, and sends the performance data as a file to a subscription end point.
File download by Consumer (Pull) – In a file download by consumer case, the subscription indicates that the data should be made available. When this event occurs, the PSM retrieves the data and sends a file ready notification to the SMO. Later, the SMO will retrieve the file.

Performance Measurement Job Query Use Case
High Level Description
PM Jobs collect performance data on O-Cloud infrastructure resources. Preinstalled Performance Measurement Jobs (PM Jobs) are started on O-Cloud genesis. Additionally, PM Jobs can be created through a request from a consumer (see the PM Job Creation use case).
This use case describes a flow where a consumer can query for PM Jobs in the O-Cloud.
In the query request, a consumer can specify a query filter for the state of a PM Job(s) of interest. Supported PM Job states include active, suspended, and deprecated defined as follows:
ACTIVE STATE – A PM Job that has been created and is currently running is defined to be in the Active state.
SUSPENDED STATE – A PM Job that has been created, and through a request to stop measurement collection is defined to be in the suspended state. See the PM Job Suspend use case for more details [NOTE: for future addition].
DEPRECATED STATE – As a result of a PM job deletion request, the PM job is defined to be in the deprecated state. See the PM Job Delete use case (3.8.7).

Performance Measurement Job Delete Use Case
High Level Description
PM Jobs collect performance data on O-Cloud infrastructure resources. Preinstalled Performance Measurement Jobs (PM Jobs) are started on O-Cloud genesis. Additionally, PM Jobs can be created through a request from a consumer (see the PM Job Creation use case).
This use case describes a flow where a consumer requests for PM Job(s) to be deleted. A consumer can specify the PM Job(s) to be deleted by the associated PM Job Identifiers (IDs) which can be obtained through a PM Job query or PM Job create.
DEPRECATED STATE – As a result of a PM Job deletion request, the PM Job(s) go into the deprecated state. Deprecated PM Job(s) records are held for a retention period after which they are purged from the system. It is expected that the retention period can be configured. PM Job(s) stay in the deprecated state until they are purged; thus, PM Job(s) cannot be “resurrected” once they are in the deprecated state.
SUSPEND BEFORE DELETE – Only suspended PM Jobs can be deleted. A consumer or owner needs to first suspend the PM Job(s) before they can be deleted. Preinstalled PM Jobs cannot be suspended by a typical consumer request. See the PM Job suspend use case for more details [NOTE 1: use case to be added in future].
PREINSTALLED PM JOBS – Preinstalled PM Jobs are unlike normal PM Jobs. Rather, Preinstalled PM Jobs may be deleted by IMS software update, or by privilege settings.
PM JOB OWNERSHIP – It is expected that a PM Job has one owner though it might have more than one consumer. A User (Operator or Entity) has a Role, and that Role has Privilege/Permissions associated with. Thus, the role may have the permissions to affect the state or delete a PM Job. Preinstalled PM Jobs also have owners. NOTE 2: Security considerations and analysis from the O-RAN Security Requirements specification [18] is FFS.
NOTIFICATION AFTER DELETION – The PM Job deletion operation may affect subscriber(s) that were getting data from the deleted PM Job(s). One of the consequences of this use case is that the subscriber(s) are notified if they had been subscribing to data collected by those PM Job(s) that were deleted. They choose to subscribe to job change notification, or they may take action after getting a report that indicates that those affected measurements were deleted.
NOTE 3: A O-Cloud Operator may wish to minimize the computational overhead within the O-Cloud and thus may delete lower priority PM Job(s).

Performance Measurement Job Update Use Case
High Level Description
PM Jobs collect performance data on O-Cloud infrastructure resources. Preinstalled Performance Measurement Jobs (PM Jobs) are started on O-Cloud genesis. Additionally, PM Jobs can be created through a request from a consumer (see the PM Job Creation use case).
This use case describes Performance Measurement Job (PM Job) updates that can occur from one of two reasons as described:
RESOURCE CHANGES – Resource changes can cause PM Job(s) to update. PM Job(s) collect data from O-Cloud infrastructure resources. When O-Cloud resources are updated, added, or deleted that a PM Job depends on, the PM Job update use case may be invoked. Resources changes can impact the PM Job measure criteria which include the measured Resources, collected Measures, qualified Resource Types, and/or Resource scope criteria which may trigger a PM Job update. It is possible that the result of the evaluation may not alter the PM Job(s).
UPDATE BY REQUEST – A consumer (operator or entity) may also request for an update to PM Job(s) through a request operation. A consumer may request for data collection updates for PM Job(s). For example, different data to be collected from O-Cloud infrastructure resources. This may occur autonomously from a consumer, for example through a policy trigger. Only a consumer with the proper permissions that own the PM Job(s) can update the PM Job.

Performance Measurement Job Suspend Use Case
High Level Description
PM Jobs collect performance data on O-Cloud infrastructure resources. Preinstalled Performance Measurement Jobs (PM Jobs) are started on O-Cloud genesis. Additionally, PM Jobs can be created through a request from a consumer (see the PM Job Creation use case).
This use case describes a flow where a Performance Measurement Job (PM jobs) is suspended. Suspending a PM Job might be done to improve system performance because PM Jobs come at the cost of system overhead and computational cycles. Suspending a PM Job will cause it to be inactive when its report timer is triggered where it would normally collect data.
DORMANCY PERIODS – PM Job(s) can be suspended for a specified time period (dormancy period). A consumer may specify when PM Job(s) can be returned to normal operation. The request can either specify a dormancy filter or suspend the PM Job indefinitely (“PM Job Stop”). PM Jobs indefinitely suspended need a consumer request to resume operations. See the PM Job Resume use case.
RELATION TO PM JOB DELETE OPERATION – Only suspended PM Jobs can be deleted. A consumer or owner first suspends PM Job(s) before they can be deleted. Preinstalled PM Jobs cannot be suspended by a typical consumer request. See the PM Job delete use case for more details.
PM JOB OWNERSHIP – It is expected that a PM Job has one owner, though it might have more than one consumer. The role has the permissions to suspend a PM Job. A User (Operator or Entity) has a Role, and that Role has Privilege/Permissions associated with. Thus, a user (operator or entity) has permissions based on their role. Preinstalled PM Jobs also have owners. Relationship to the Security specification is FFS.

High Level Description
PM Jobs collect performance data on O-Cloud infrastructure resources. Preinstalled Performance Measurement Jobs (PM Jobs) are started on O-Cloud genesis. Additionally, PM Jobs can be created through a request from a consumer (see the PM Job Creation use case).
This use case describes resuming one Performance Measurement Job (PM Job) that has previously been suspended. See the PM Job Suspend Use case for more details.
RESUMING OPERATIONS – PM Job(s) in the suspend state have had their measurement collection activity halted. The PM Job Resume operation will request that the PM Job start operations again. The PM Job will transition to the active state. The PM Job will begin measurement collection at their next scheduled collection interval period. The PM Job will continue to collect measurements based on their criteria. To change the interval times or collection behavior, a PM Job update would need to be performed.
PM JOB OWNERSHIP – It is expected that a PM Job has one owner, though it might have more than one consumer. The role has the permissions to resume a PM Job. A User (Operator or Entity) has a Role, and that Role has Privilege/Permissions associated with. Thus, a user (operator or entity) has permissions based on their role. Preinstalled PM Jobs also have owners. Relationship to the Security specification is FFS.

Performance Management Dictionary Discovery IMS Use Case
High Level Description
When a new O-Cloud Resource Type is discovered in the O-Cloud infrastructure either on O-Cloud genesis or during run-time, the IMS would inform FOCOM (SMO) about that new Resource Type so that the appropriate corresponding Performance Management Dictionary can be identified.
NOTE: every version of Resource has its own Resource Type and thus a Performance Management Dictionary associated with it.
It is expected that the SMO would have already onboarded the associated Resource Type before it is discovered by the O-Cloud infrastructure, as described in O2 IMS Specification [17]. The four situations where a Performance Management dictionary could be discovered are:
RESOURCE SOFTWARE UPDATE – A software update of a Resource creates a new Resource Type with its attendant Performance Management Dictionary in inventory. Existing resources can either remain pointing to the existing Resource Type or be software updated to the newly loaded Resource Type. Each Resource Type has its own unique Performance Management dictionary associated with it at the SMO.
QUERY & SYNCHRONIZATION – A query service may also result in the discovery of new Resource Types in the O-Cloud infrastructure. Additionally, the initial synchronization of the model between the O-Cloud and management system (SMO) may result in the discovery of Resource Types to be managed.
NEW RESOURCES ADDED – New objects have been added to the O-Cloud infrastructure. Subsequently, new Resource Types corresponding to those new objects may be added which then may result in an Infrastructure Inventory Event being generated to a consumer (FOCOM/SMO) or subscriber.
IMS LIFE CYCLE SOFTWARE UPDATE – When the software of the O-Cloud is updated new Resource Types can be discovered. The updated IMS software could come with new Resource types including their Performance Management Dictionaries.
There are two possible ways the IMS gets the Performance Management Dictionary (PM Dictionary). The first is that SMO might update the IMS with the Performance Management Dictionary. The second method is for the IMS to get the Performance Management Dictionary from the O-Cloud Resource (or external proxy for the resource). See the Resource Type Onboarding LCM Use Case for more details. The source of truth is in the cloud for O-Cloud Resource Types.

Performance Management Subscription Query (IMS) Use Case
High Level Description
This use case details the management of Performance Measurement Subscriptions; in particular, the query service operation. The query of a Performance Measurement Subscription is the ability of an authorized entity to get the details of a Performance Measurement Subscription including its performance subscription filter.
The create, update, and delete of a Performance Measurement Subscription is documented in the other Performance Measurement Subscription use cases. This use case only concerns the query of a Performance Measurement Subscription.
NOTE: The query-response paradigm and CRUD paradigm (Read in this case) are synonymous in terms of this use case. That is, Query (cf. query-response) and Read (cf. CRUD operations) are synonymous in for this use case.
The performance framework is described in the GA&P specification (reference [x]). The Performance Measurement Subscription filter defines the following things (among others) for collecting and reporting Performance Measurements over O2ims:
-	The subscription filter qualifies what data from the Performance Measurement jobs should be sent.
-	The subscription filter indicates the collection timing interval.
-	The subscription filter specifies the reporting mechanisms (file-based reporting, stream-based reporting, event notification reporting).
-	The subscription filter dictates the report formats.
An entity performing the query would usually be the SMO; however, it could also be another authorized user, technician, or machine (e.g. software, script, etc.). Typically, an entity would perform a subscription query to cross-check their Performance Measurement Subscription. Though, it could also be utilized for other management purposes as well.
Performance Measurement Subscription describes a subscription mechanism dedicated to getting reports for Performance Measurements. The Performance Management Subscription is not used since we have dedicated subscriptions for measurements specifically.

This use case describes the update of a Performance Measurement Subscription. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 (see Reference x) specifies the API to perform a PM Job update. The update of PM Job allows for the update of the subscription including the callback URIs for the notification of events of PM Jobs.
The create, query, and delete of a Performance Measurement Subscription is documented in other Performance Measurement Subscription related use cases. The query-response paradigm and CRUD paradigm (update in this case) are synonymous in terms of this use case. This use case only concerns the update of a Performance Measurement Subscription.
The Performance Measurement Subscription update allows for an entity to modify the subscription filter for notifications of interest by a consumer with an update order (see below). Because there is metadata related to the Performance Measurement Subscription it is meaningful to have an update operation. The Performance Measurement Subscription update would be able to change the following things:
Connection Information – This describes the connection information which includes the Performance Measurement Subscription ID, the Mode, encoding scheme and callback URI.
Resources, Resource Types – This part of the update order describes which O-Cloud resources, or the O-Cloud resource types. Any resources that of the specified type, metrics are collected on.
Delivery Details – This describes the delivery information including the reporting interval, and whether redundant data should be suppressed.
Received Measures – This describes the measures to be received to be reported.
PM Jobs – The subscription update can alter the PM Jobs involved.
NOTE: Some modifications concerning the Performance Measurement Subscription, such as callback URI, can also be performed by modifying/updating the underlying PM Jobs.
An entity requesting for a subscription update would usually be the SMO; however, it could also be another authorized user, administrator, technician, or machine (e.g., software, script, etc.). Typically, an endpoint moved, or there are new URI endpoints. Only an entity with the proper permissions or authorization would be allowed to make a PM subscription update.

Performance Management Subscription Delete (IMS) Use Case
High Level Description
This use case is about the Management of Performance Measurement Subscriptions; in particular, the delete service operation. The create, update, and query of a Performance Measurement Subscription are documented in separate use cases. This use case only concerns the deletion of one or more Performance Measurement Subscription(s) based on a list of subscription(s).
The delete of a Performance Measurement Subscription is the ability of an authorized entity to delete a Performance Measurement Subscription towards the IMS.  An entity here would usually be the SMO; however, it could also be another authorized user/technician, or machine (e.g., software, script, etc.).
Any subscription operations that change a subscription are logged. Therefore, the delete of a Performance Measurement subscription is expected to be logged within the O-Cloud IMS.

Performance Management Configuration Use Case
High Level Description
The Performance Management Configuration use case will allow for a requesting entity to alter other attributes not covered in the Performance Management Job Creation Use Case and the Performance Management Subscription Use Cases.
This use case complements the Performance Management Job Creation Use Case, Performance Measurement Job Creation Use Case, Performance Management Subscription Use Case, Performance Management Subscription Update Use Case which are other use cases that will configure the behavior of the Performance Management operation. These other use cases can alter subtending attributes of the PeformanceSubscription and PerformanceManagementJob family of related objects.
Thus, this use case is focused on the ability to change other attributes related to Performance Management operation. For example, the PerformanceMeasureStore class has a retentionPeriod attribute which can be configured with this use case. The definition of the retentionPeriod is covered in the O2 Information Model. See the Alarm Purge Use Case (see clause 3.7.13 in this document) and Alarm List Management (see clause 3.7.11 in this document) and Retention Period concepts for further details (O2 General Aspects and Principles [9])

VLAN Management Use Cases
VLAN Allocation Use Case
High Level Description
This Use Case supports allocation of a VLAN ID to support various deployment use cases such a network slice.
As an example, one of the consumers is RAN NSSMF (Network Slice Subnet Management Function) that needs to associate a RAN slice to a VLAN ID during slice subnet provisioning procedures. Within a given O-Cloud, RAN NSSMF uses this VLAN ID as handover between O-Cloud and transport network so that the slice could be carried through the transport network across multiple O-Clouds.  If a slice spans multiple O-Clouds, this handover is necessary for each segment of the transport connecting these O-Clouds. See Annex A in the O-RAN.WG1.Slicing-Architecture-v05.00 [14] as to how this VLAN ID is used in various deployments.
The scope of this use case is simply to allocate/reserve a VLAN ID within O-Cloud. As a part of this use case, no configuration is pushed in the O-Cloud.
Since VLANs have a local significance, each O-Cloud manages a pool of VLAN IDs, and returns a VLAN ID upon a query/request from SMO (FOCOM). To avoid using the same VLAN ID multiple times, O-Cloud may take the VLAN ID out of the “available” pool after it allocates it. O-Cloud may choose any mechanism to ensure that same VLAN IDs is not used multiple times.
NOTE: There are other viable identifiers to associate a slice with (such as VLANs, VNIs, VRFs, etc.), In the initial version of O-RAN network slicing, VLAN IDs are used for this purpose. Additional identifiers, or an abstract identifier may be introduced in future. This does not impose any networking constrains within O-Cloud.

VLAN Deallocation Use Case
High Level Description
This use case supports deallocation of a VLAN ID when a given VLAN ID not needed anymore, such as at the time of deletion of a network slice. A given VLAN IDs is a returned back to “available” pool of VLAN IDs in each O-Cloud.
VLAN IDs are a limited/finite set of pool. Therefore, it is important to recycle the VLAN IDs as they are not needed anymore. As an example, when a network slice is deleted, RAN NSSMF sends a deallocate VLAN ID request to O-Cloud. O-Cloud moves the VLAN ID into the pool of available VLAN IDs.

Network Slicing Use Cases
Network Slice Creation Use Case
3.10.1.1 High Level Description
This use case supports creation of RAN slice subnet.
Network slices may span across multiple domains such as RAN, Core, and Transport. The slice is divided into multiple subnets; one subnet per domain, i.e., RAN Slice Subnet, Transport Slice Subnet, and Core Slice Subnet. This section only covers the RAN Slice Subnet.
Network slice creation requires creation of O-RAN Network Slice Subnet Instance (O-NSSI). RAN Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF) manages the creation and deletion of O-NSSI. For details, please see O-RAN.WG1.Slicing-Architecture-v06.00 [14].
RAN NSSMF also manages disaggregated RAN deployment use cases where Network Functions (such as O-DU and O-CU) are deployed in different O-Clouds or in different locations in each O-Cloud. RAN NSSMF manages creation of O-NSSI and relevant Network Functions (NFs) across multiple O-Clouds. RAN NSSMF triggers the Network Functions management operation via NFO. RAN NSSMF also coordinates with the constituent Transport NSSMF to achieve the slice connectivity across multiple O-Clouds.
RAN NSSMF coordinates with its constituent Transport NSSMF through NSMF to stitch the connectivity across multiple O-Clouds or multiple sites in a distributed O-Cloud (for disaggregated RAN deployments). In such deployments, the network connectivity for the slice may require multiple network connections, herein referred to as network segments. For example, a slice spanning across two O-Clouds connected by transport may have up to 5 network segments. Two network segments within each O-Cloud, two segments between the O-Clouds and their respective Transport attachment points and a fifth network segment in the transport network.
In multi-vendor O-RAN deployments, many flavors of NFs may co-exist. Some may require trunked interfaces whereas others may require access interfaces. Similarly, multiple forms for NFs may exist such as CNFs, VNFs, or PNFs.
The End-2-End slice is associated with a network segment unique identifier per network segment, herein called a tag. While a choice of various viable identifiers (such as VLANs, VNIs, VRFs, etc.) is available, in this Use Case a VLAN ID is one of the example identifier/tags for network slicing. In that case, VLAN IDs are chosen for both within O-Cloud as well as for handover to the transport network.
NOTE 1: The use case further elaborates on the scenario of using VLAN IDs, but other network segmentation solutions are also possible.
The packets marked with this unique tag/VLAN ID traverse the network segments within O-Cloud and are of local significance within a given network segment. This tag/VLAN ID may be stitched/mapped to a different tag by the O-Cloud Gateway to handover to the transport network attachment point. As an example, say VLAN ID 100 was chosen to mark an EMBB slice. This VLAN ID 100 may map to a VRF_X at O-Cloud Gateway and a VLAN ID 200 may be used to carry the same packets in the transport network. This mapping allows the transport network to carry the packets associated with each slice.
Depending upon the slice SLAs and deployment scenario of a slice, RAN NSSMF makes the decisions such as:
If additional NF instances need to be deployed (e.g., one O-DU instance per slice), or
Use the existing NF for the new slice (e.g., shared resources for a slice)
RAN NSSMF/SMO makes an NF placement decision taking all relevant information into account.
Etc.
NOTE 2: The actual details of such decisions by RAN NSSMF are out of the scope for this use case. See O-RAN.WG1.Slicing-Architecture-v06.00 for details.

Network Slice Deletion Use Case
High Level Description
This use case supports the deletion of the network slice.
When RAN NSSMF deletes a slice subnet, the Network Function instances associated with the slice may need to be terminated as well. Depending upon the deployment scenario (e.g., shared network functions vs. non shared), RAN NSSMF makes decision if NF needs to be terminated or not.  RAN NSSMF sends request to NFO to terminate appropriate NFs.
A VLAN ID associated with the slice is deallocated (both at O-Cloud Site Network Fabric as well as O-Cloud Node Cluster Network level) so that O-Cloud could reuse the VLAN ID for further use.

Create Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster Use Case
High level description
This use case describes the processing of a request to create a single Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster from the FOCOM towards the IMS at the O-Cloud. The use case aims to assign a suitable set of computer systems, storage resources and network connectivity as a basis for a K8s Cluster, to establish a K8s Cluster in the O-Cloud and to inform the requesting entity what has been created. Before this use case is started it is expected that SMO has concluded that a new K8s Cluster needs to be created in a specific O-Cloud. When the use case is concluded, any modified O-Cloud (exposed) Resources are updated in the O-Cloud Inventory model.
NOTE: A Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster is an example of O-Cloud Node Cluster supporting container infrastructure services.

Delete Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster Use Case
High Level Description
This use case describes the processing of a request to delete a single Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster from FOCOM to IMS in the O-Cloud. The objective of the operation is to delete a previously created Kubernetes Cluster. This is part of a family of O2 IMS Provisioning operations related to Kubernetes Clusters.
When the use case is concluded, the specified Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster in the O-Cloud is deleted. Typically, the associated (exposed) O-Cloud Resources are released and updated in the O-Cloud Inventory model. Depending on implementation the O-Cloud Resources may not immediately be released.

Update O-Cloud Node Cluster Use Case
High Level Description
This use case describes the flow of a request to update a single O-Cloud Node Cluster with O-Cloud Node addition(s) or reduction(s), including adding/removing cluster capabilities. The update request of an O-Cloud Node Cluster originates from FOCOM and is sent towards the IMS within the O-Cloud. The objective of the operation is to update a previously created and configured O-Cloud Node Cluster. This is part of a family of O2 IMS Provisioning operations related to O-Cloud Node Clusters.
An update of an O-Cloud Node Cluster can also include updates of configuration that are cluster-wide, and updating the capabilities of cluster, e.g., adding support for new types of resources comprising the O-Cloud Nodes or modes of network connectivity.
NOTE: the operations that are performed during an update may be part of maintenance or management functions.
When the use case is concluded, the specified O-Cloud Node Cluster in the O-Cloud has been updated.
A disruption policy is the amount of disruption allowed during the update operation. An update of an O-Cloud Node Cluster is manually initiated or automatically scheduled, planned, or triggered. This deployment-level tolerance for disruption is the number of O-Cloud Nodes that can become simultaneously unavailable during the update. For example, a deployment could be created with a disruption policy of losing up to 2 nodes. In this case, it would be possible to lose 2 nodes and continue while performing the cluster update. Each pod may have its own Disruption policy. The idea is to calculate how many nodes could be updated at a time.

Resource Optimization Use Cases
Introduction
O-Cloud resource optimization is the process of utilizing the O-Cloud resources in an efficient manner and eliminating waste of O-Cloud resources by selecting, provisioning, and rightsizing the resources within the O-Cloud.
The Network Functions (NFs) within O-Cloud are orchestrated as VNFs/CNFs. The SMO (NFO, FOCOM) handle the management and orchestration of VNFs/CNFs and underlying O-Cloud infrastructure. The SMO's management, orchestration, and optimization functionalities can be enhanced by intelligent observability analysis from VNFs/CNFs and O-Cloud.
The Non-RT RIC hosts third-party applications such as rApp in the SMO, which can collect and read various O1 and O2-related observability data and metrics through O1 & O2 related services. These third-party rApps can be leveraged to provide guidance/recommendations to the NFO and FOCOM for management, orchestration, and optimization of VNFs/CNFs and underlying O-Cloud infrastructure.
O-Cloud Drain Node Use Case
High Level Description
This use case describes the procedure for the SMO and O-Cloud to drain one or more O-Cloud Node(s) based on recommendations from rApp  or manually by O-Cloud Maintainer via SMO. The draining of O-Cloud Node(s) will mark the specific O-Cloud Node(s) as cordoned or un-schedulable and can necessitate means to relocate, migrate or terminate Network Functions or its components to another O-Cloud Node.
There are various possible scenarios where there's a need to drain an O-Cloud Node(s). One such example scenario could be where rApp, with the help of AI/ML, can provide insights to FOCOM/NFO for O-Cloud Node failure. rApp predicting the O-Cloud Node failure can recommend FOCOM/NFO to drain that particular O-Cloud Node and proactively migrate the workloads from the O-Cloud Node. Subsequently, this NF migration, as a result of the node draining recommendation, ensures service continuity by minimizing disruption and assuring the quality of service for the network slices and services.
In this use case, the SMO manages NF(s) relocation. The request for draining an O-Cloud Node(s) can be manual, or rApps can send a recommendation to FOCOM/NFO. This use-case (along with other Resource Optimization use-cases) envisions a data-driven approach for optimizing O-Cloud resources. The rApps in non-RT RIC utilizing AI/ML framework can provide guidance to FOCOM/NFO complementing FOCOM/NFO scheduling capabilities and empowering the system to make more data driven placement decisions.
NOTE 1 : The current version of the specification does not specify whether it’s the IMS or DMS that receives the request to drain the O-Cloud node(s).
NOTE 2 : The O-Cloud Node(s) is set to maintenance mode (see clause 3.10.2 in O2 GA&P [9]) by default, when this use case is called.

O-Cloud Cordon and Uncordon Use Case
High Level Description
This use case describes how to Cordon and then Uncordon an O-Cloud Node(s) (after the successful cordoning of the node) in a O-Cloud Node Cluster.
Cordoning(s) a node is performed in order to mark the O-Cloud Node(s) un-schedulable. Marking the O-Cloud Node(s) as un-schedulable prevents the scheduler from placing new NF deployments on the specified O-Cloud Node(s) but does not affect existing NF deployments on the O-Cloud Node(s). This is useful as a preparatory step before draining an O-Cloud Node(s).
The action to Cordon or Uncordon an O-Cloud Node(s) can be a recommendation by an rApp or a manual request submitted by Cloud Maintainer via SMO
In the context of O-Cloud Resource Optimisation, rApps utilizing O2 telemetry data can recommend the cordoning and uncordoning of O-Cloud Nodes, to achieve optimized resource allocation, as explained below. To enable this functionality, O-Cloud exposes the following telemetry data to FOCOM and rApp, including but not limited to:
O-Cloud Node(s) CPU utilisation
O-Cloud Node(s) Memory utilisation
O-Cloud Node(s) Disk utilisation
rApps can correlate the above information with other data e.g., O1 telemetry data related to Network Traffic.
rApps can predict periods of high resource utilization (e.g., within the next 4 hours) and recommend Cordoning of O-Cloud Node(s) to FOCOM. This ensures that critical performance-sensitive workloads are not placed on specific O-Cloud Nodes during peak times.
rApps continuously evaluate the conditions (based on O2 and/or O1 telemetry data and their correlation) Once the predicted high traffic period has passed and the resource utilization on the O-Cloud Node has returned to normal levels, the rApp can recommend Uncordoning the O-Cloud Node to allow new NF deployments to be scheduled on the node again.
Alternatively, if periods of high resource utilization are predicted, then one possible action could be to recommend to uncordon some previously cordoned nodes (i.e., those that are done with the maintenance activities) so that they are available for this period. And when decreased resource utilization is predicted, the recommendation could be to cordon specific O-Cloud nodes that are not required for handling the NF Deployment.
NOTE 1: rApps take into consideration the potential impact of Cordoning & Uncordoning of the O-Cloud Node(s) on future system performance. Therefore, the rApps will only recommend Cordoning of the O-Cloud Node(s) if it predicts a prolonged period of high or low O-Cloud resource usage, and Uncordoning if the resource utilization returns to normal levels, to avoid unnecessary and frequent Cordoning and Uncordoning of the O-Cloud Node(s).
NOTE 2: This version of the use case does not describe the role and involvement of FOCOM vs. NFO and how IMS interacts with the DMS.
Editor’s Note: Architecture issues associated with the use case such as the involvement of FOCOM vs. NFO and on how IMS interacts with the DMS are still under discussion and should be reviewed for any impact on the sequence description and UML flow diagrams.
