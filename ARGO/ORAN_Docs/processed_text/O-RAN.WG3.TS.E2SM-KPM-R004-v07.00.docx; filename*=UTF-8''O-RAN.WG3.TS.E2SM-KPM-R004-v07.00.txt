7.3.2	Event Trigger Style 1: Periodic Report

Event Trigger style 1 shall set the KPM report period and uses the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.1.1)

7.3.3	Event Trigger Style 2: Measurement Event

Event Trigger style 2 is used to configure event-based reporting based on measurement data. Each event condition is defined using measurement-based or value-based parameters, and is evaluated based on the availability of measurement samples. If the Event Evaluation Period IE is included, the event condition is evaluated periodically according to the configured evaluation period. Otherwise, it is continuously evaluated whenever a new measurement sample becomes available for the associated parameters. The E2 Node can be configured with multiple event conditions simultaneously and triggered to send KPM reports when all the configured events happen or for any logical combination of events.

Example	For a window-average of three measurement samples of a specific measurement associated with a cell to be compared against a threshold integer value and triggered when exceeding the threshold, the Event Condition IE in 8.2.1.1.2 can be defined as follows:

The Event Left Expression IE contains only one parameter and selects the Parameter Type IE as “Measurement”, where the Measurement Definition IE specifies the measurement and the associated cell via 8.3.33, and the corresponding Window Definition IE configures a window size of three with its aggregation function set to "avg".

The Event Logical Operator IE is set to "greaterthan".

The Event Right Expression IE contains only one parameter and selects the Parameter Type IE as “Value”, where the Test Value IE is assigned to the threshold integer value.

Example	For a sum of two different measurements (each from measurement type 1 and type 2, respectively) associated with a cell to be compared against a window-average of five measurement samples of a measurement type 3 associated with the same cell, and triggered when exceeding the window-averaged value, the Event Condition IE in 8.2.1.1.2 can be defined as follows:

The Event Left Expression IE contains two parameters and selects the first Parameter Type IE as “Measurement”, where the Measurement Definition IE specifies the measurement type 1 and the associated cell via 8.3.33 while the corresponding Window Definition IE is absent.

The Event Left Expression IE also selects the second Parameter Type IE as “Measurement”, where the Measurement Definition IE specifies the measurement type 2 and the associated cell via 8.3.33 while the corresponding Window Definition IE is absent. The Event Left Expression IE also includes the Aggregation Function IE set to “sum”.

The Event Logical Operator IE is set to "greaterthan".

The Event Right Expression IE contains only one parameter and selects the Parameter Type IE as “Measurement”, where the Measurement Definition IE specifies the measurement type 3 and the associated cell via 8.3.33, and the corresponding Window Definition IE configures a window size of five with its aggregation function set to "avg".

For any measurement-based parameter used in an event condition defined by the RIC Event Trigger Definition IE, the corresponding measurement must be subscribed by the RIC Action Definition IE in the same RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message from the Near-RT RIC.

In this version of the specification, a measurement-based parameter associated with a specific UE is not supported.

This RIC Event Trigger Definition IE style uses RIC Event Trigger Definition IE Format 2 (8.2.1.1.2).

7.4.2	REPORT Service Style 1: E2 Node Measurement

7.4.2.1	REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 1 provides the performance measurement information collection from an E2 Node.

7.4.2.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents

REPORT Service style 1 aims to subscribe to the measurements defined in TS 28.552 [4] and TS 32.425 [8], and shall use the RIC Action Definition IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.2.1).

REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE Format 1 contains measurement types that Near-RT RIC is requesting to subscribe followed by a list of subcounters to be measured for each measurement type, and a granularity period indicating collection interval of those measurements. For a certain measurement type to be subscribed, the Matching Condition for Reporting IE may also be included to give conditions for the E2 Node in reporting measurements, to report a measured value corresponding to that measurement type only when the value satisfies the given conditions.

For the measurement types that belong to a measurement object class confined in a single cell (e.g. "EUtranCellFDD" in TS 32.425 [8] or "NRCellDU" in TS 28.552 [4]), the Cell Global ID IE shall be included in the IE to point to a specific cell for collecting measurements within the E2 Node. The Cell Global ID IE shall not be included if all the subscribed measurement types are cell agnostic, i.e. belonging to measurement object classes not confined in a single cell (e.g. "GNBCUUPFunction" in TS 28.552 [4]). In case that both single-cell-confined and cell agnostic measurement types are subscribed together, the Cell Global ID IE shall be included in the IE and the E2 Node shall ignore the included Cell Global ID IE for those cell agnostic measurement types.

A measurement ID can be used for subscription instead of a measurement type if an identifier of a certain measurement type was exposed by an E2 Node via the RAN Function Definition IE.

7.4.2.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents

REPORT Service style 1 shall use the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.3.1), which contains a measurement collection start time as UTC format.

REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 may carry file format version, sender name, sender type, and vendor name as printable strings.

7.4.2.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents

REPORT Service style 1 shall use the RIC Indication Message IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.4.1).

REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE Format 1 carries a set of measurement data reported from an E2 Node. The reported data contains a set of measurement records, each collected at every granularity period during the reporting period. In case that the Matching Condition for Reporting IE has been configured in the RIC Action Definition IE for a measurement type and a measured value corresponding to that measurement type in a granularity period did not satisfy the configured reporting condition, the E2 Node shall indicate “Not Satisfied” instead of reporting the actual measured value within the measurement record corresponding to that granularity period. In case the configured reporting condition(s) are not satisfied entirely for a reporting period for all the subscribed measurement types, the E2 Node may omit sending the report for this reporting period. In case the E2 Node is not able to provide reliable data for a granularity period during the reporting period, it may include the optional Incomplete Flag IE, which indicates that the corresponding measurements record in the reported data is not reliable.

REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE Format 1 may carry subscription information, i.e. Measurement Information List IE that indicates the order of measured values for each measurement record in the reported data, or their granularity period. If not present, the original subscription information shall apply.

7.4.3	REPORT Service Style 2: E2 Node Measurement for a single UE

7.4.3.1	REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 2 provides the performance measurement information collection for a single UE of interest from an E2 Node.

7.4.3.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents

REPORT Service style 2 shall use the RIC Action Definition IE Format 2 (see clause 8.2.1.2.2), where the included UE ID indicates a specific UE of interest for measurement collection.

The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.2.

7.4.3.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents

REPORT Service style 2 shall use the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

7.4.3.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents

REPORT Service style 2 shall use the RIC Indication Message IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.4.1) as described in 7.4.2.4, where the measurement data reported is associated only to a specific UE that was subscribed.

7.4.4	REPORT Service Style 3: Condition-based, UE-level E2 Node Measurement

7.4.4.1	REPORT Service Style description

REPORT Service style 3 provides the UE-level performance measurement information collection for a group of UEs per measurement type matching subscribed conditions from an E2 Node.

7.4.4.2	REPORT Service RIC Action Definition IE contents

REPORT Service style 3 shall use the RIC Action Definition IE Format 3 (see clause 8.2.1.2.3), where, for each requested measurement within the Measurement Information Condition List IE, the Matching Condition IE serves as a condition to include the matched UEs’ measurement values into the reporting. The Matching Condition IE can be expressed by a list of subcounters to be measured (i.e. as a list of labels), or by a list of test conditions that need to be passed, or by a combination of both.

The rest of the subscription information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.2.

7.4.4.3	REPORT Service RIC Indication Header IE contents

REPORT Service style 3 shall use the RIC Indication Header IE Format 1 (see clause 8.2.1.3.1) as described in 7.4.2.3.

7.4.4.4	REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE contents

REPORT Service style 3 shall use the RIC Indication Message IE Format 2 (see clause 8.2.1.4.2).

REPORT Service RIC Indication Message IE Format 2 carries a set of UE-level measurement data matching subscribed conditions. The included Measurement Information Condition UE List IE indicates the order of measured values for each measurement record in the reported data – a list of all the UE ID(s) satisfying the subscribed Matching Condition IE for each requested measurement within a Reporting Period.

In every granularity period during which a UE matching a subscribed condition stays in the E2 Node and maintains the  RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state, the E2 Node shall collect the related data and reports it at the end of the reporting period.

The List of matched UE IDs IE for a certain measurement type in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE indicates all the UE ID(s) that satisfied the subscribed Matching Condition IE for that measurement type and maintained the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state at least for one granularity period during the reporting period. The List of matched UE IDs IE can be omitted for a certain subscribed measurement type if none of the UEs were matched during the reporting period. If the List of matched UE IDs IE is used for a measurement type, then the same IE shall be used for all the measurement types in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE.

If the List of matched UE IDs IE is used, in the granularity periods where the UE does not appear in the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state (e.g. transitioned to RRC_IDLE or UE identity track is lost), the E2 Node shall not collect the related data and NULL shall be reported for those granularity periods until the end of the Reporting Period. In this case, the E2 Node shall stop reporting measurements related to this UE in the subsequent reporting periods. If the List of matched UE IDs IE is used and a UE whose ID is included in the IE appeared in the middle of the reporting period, then NULL shall be reported for the granularity periods priori to the UE appearing in the E2 Node.

On the other hand, the Sequence of Matched UE IDs for Granularity Periods IE for a certain measurement type in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE can be used to indicate the UE ID(s) that satisfied the subscribed Matching Condition IE for the corresponding measurement type and maintained the RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE state, separately for each and every granularity period in chronological order. If the Sequence of Matched UE IDs for Granularity Periods IE is used for a measurement type, then the same IE shall be used for all the measurement types in the Measurement Information Condition UE List IE, and the List of matched UE IDs IE, if included for any measurement type, shall be ignored.

The rest of the information follows the same as described in 7.4.2.4.

8.3	Information Element definitions

8.3.1	General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);

-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

Non-GoB Beamforming Mode Index

O

INTEGER (1.. 65535, ...)

Represents the Non- Grid of Beams (Non-GoB) beamforming mode subcounter [21]. The index is used for Non-GoB beamforming optimization for 5G mMIMO deployments. Each BF mode implies a vendor-specific proprietary Non-GoB BF algorithm that are not standardized [i.1], for which each E2 Node, who supports the Non-GoB beamforming optimization feature, provides the number of different Non-GoB BF mode(s) supported by its scheduler indexed from 1 to n. The AI/ML model for Non-GoB beamforming optimization is trained by data and measurements related to each BF mode and/or MIMO mode, for which the trained AI/ML model, based on collected data, configures the E2 Node with the best inferred Non-GoB BF mode index to be used for each UE, where such configuration could be done separately for the case of Single User- and/or Multi-user MIMO [21].

MIMO Mode Index

In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 8.2 and 8.3, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.

If an E2SM information element carried as an OCTET STRING in an E2AP [3] message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 9.

Annex A (normative or informative):
Further information on RAN Function Network KPM Monitor

A.1	Background Information

The RAN function “Key Performance Measurement” is used to provide RIC Service exposure of the performance measurement logical function of the E2 Nodes. Based on the O-RAN deployment architecture, available measurements could be different. Figure A.1-1 shows the target deployment architecture for E2SM-KPM.

Figure A.1-1 E2SM-KPM Architecture

For each logical function the E2 Node shall use the RAN Function Definition IE to declare the list of available measurements and a set of supported RIC Services (REPORT).
