This document provides O-RAN WG1 detailed use case descriptions. Any multi-WG use case defined in O-RAN is expected to be documented in “O-RAN WG1 Use Case Analysis Report” and if the use case is to be studied further, it will be covered in this document in detail, and then in relevant WGs. It should be noted that not all of the use cases presented here are currently supported by O-RAN specifications and these use cases will be addressed in future O-RAN work.

Chapter 3 Use cases

3.1	Use case 1: Context-Based Dynamic HO Management for V2X

This  use  case  provides  the  background,  motivation,  and  requirements  for  the  Context-based Dynamic HO Management for V2X  use  case,  allowing operators to adjust radio resource allocation policies through the O-RAN architecture, reducing latency and improving radio resource utilization.

3.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

V2X communication allows for numerous potential benefits such as increasing the overall road safety, reducing emissions, and saving time. Part of the V2X architecture is the V2X UE (SIM + device attached to vehicle) which communicates with the V2X Application Server (V2X AS). The exchanged information comprises Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs), (from UE to V2X AS) [12], radio cell IDs, connection IDs, and basic radio measurements (RSRP, RSPQ, etc.)

As vehicles traverse along a highway, due to their high speed and the heterogeneous natural environment V2X UE-s are handed over frequently, at times in a suboptimal way, which may cause handover (HO) anomalies: e.g., short stay, ping-pong, and remote cell.  Such suboptimal HO sequences substantially impair the functionality of V2X applications. Since HO sequences are mainly determined by the Neighbour Relation Tables (NRTs), maintained by the xNBs, there is hardly room for UE-level customization.

This UC aims to present a method to avoid and/or resolve problematic HO scenarios by using past navigation and radio statistics in order to customize HO sequences on a UE level. To this end, the AI/ML functionality that is enabled by the Near-RT RIC is employed.

3.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Retrieve necessary performance, configuration, and other data for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models that will be deployed in Near-RT RIC to assist in the V2X HO management function. For example, this could be a clustering algorithm that classifies traffic situations and radio conditions that (probably) do or do not lead to HO anomalies.

Support deployment and update of AI/ML models into Near-RT RIC xApp.

Support communication of intents and policies (system-level and UE-level) from non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC.

Support communication of non-RAN data to enrich control functions in Near-RT RIC (enrichment data).

3.1.4	Required data

The measurement counters and KPIs (as defined by 3GPP) should be appropriately aggregated by cell, QoS type, slice, etc.

Measurement reports with RSRP/RSRQ/CQI information for serving and neighboring cells.

UE connection and mobility/handover statistics with indication of successful and failed handovers and error codes etc.

V2X related data: position, velocity, direction, navigation data, CAMs, DENMs [13][14].

3.2	Use case 2: Flight Path Based Dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation

This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements for the support the use case of flight path based dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation, allowing operators to adjust radio resource allocation policies through the O-RAN architecture, reducing unnecessary handover and improving radio resource utilization.

3.2.1	Background and goal of the use case

The field trials’ results show that the coverage for low altitude is good and can provide various services for terrestrial UEs with good performance. However, since the site along the flight is mainly for terrestrial UEs, the altitude of the UAV is always not within the main lobe of the ground station antenna. And the side lobes give rise to the phenomenon of scattered cell associations particularly noticeable in the sky. The cell association pattern on the ground is ideally contiguous area where the best cell is most often the one closest to the UE. As the UE move up in height, the antenna side lobes start to be visible, and the best cell may no longer be the closest one. The cell association pattern in this particular scenario becomes fragmented especially at the height of 300m and above. Hence, at higher altitudes, several challenges that lead to a different radio environment are:

LOS propagation/uplink interference

Poor KPI caused by antenna side lobes for base stations

Sudden drop in signal strength

These challenges directly impact on the mobility performance of the drone and the service experience of the user. Hence, we would like to support the use case of flight path based dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation to resolve the above issues.

Non-Real time RIC can retrieve necessary of Aerial Vehicles related measurement metrics from network based on UE’s measurement report and SMO, and  flight path information of Aerial vehicle, climate information, flight forbidden/limitation area information and Space Load information etc. from application, e.g. UTM(Unmanned Traffic Management) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML model that will be deployed in RAN. For example, this could be UL/DL interference from/to Aerial vehicles, the detection of Aerial Vehicle UEs, and available radio resource (e.g. frequency, cell, beam, BWP, numerology) prediction.  And the Near-Real time RIC can support deployment and execution of AI/ML models from non-RT RIC. Based on this, the Near-Real time RIC can perform the radio resource allocation for on-demand coverage for UAV considering the radio channel condition, flight path information and other application information.

Figure 3.2.1-1: Use case of flight path based dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation

Since there is no effective functional module in current eNB/gNB to retrieve the application information, perform machine learning and training based on both the acquired application information and radio environment information, and execute AI/ML models based on above information. And in the O-RAN architecture, the flight path based dynamic UAV Radio Resource Allocation mechanism can be supported by the RIC function module, i.e. non-real time RIC and near-real time RIC. Therefore, we provide the description of O-RAN support use case for flight path based dynamic UAV Radio Resource.

3.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Retrieve necessary of O-RAN Support for Aerial Vehicles related measurement metrics from network level measurement report and SMO (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML model that will be deployed in Near-RT RIC to assist in the O-RAN Support for Aerial Vehicles function. For example, this could be UL/DL interference from/to Aerial vehicles, the detection of Aerial Vehicle UEs, and available radio resource (e.g. frequency, cell, beam, BWP, numerology) prediction.

Training of potential ML models for O-RAN Support for Aerial Vehicles, which may respectively autonomously control UL/DL interference from/to Aerial vehicles, detect the UE of Aerial Vehicles, and predict available radio resource (e.g. frequency, cell, beam, BWP, numerology) for Aerial Vehicles.

Send policies/intents to Near-RT RIC to drive the O-RAN Support for Aerial Vehicles at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

Near-RT RIC:

Support update of AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC.

Support execution of the AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC.

Support interpretation and execution of intents and policies from Non-RT RIC to derive O-RAN Support for Aerial Vehicles at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

Support perform the radio resource allocation for on-demand coverage for UAV considering the radio channel condition, flight path information and other application information via the AI/ML models from non-RT RIC.

Multi-dimensional data are expected to be retrieved for AI/ML model training and policies generation.

Network level measurement report, including

UE level radio channel information, mobility related metrics

UE level location information

Aerial Vehicles related measurement metrics collected from SMO (may acquire data from application or network, e.g. flight path information of Aerial vehicle, climate information, flight forbidden/limitation area information and Space Load information).

3.3	Use case 3: Radio Resource Allocation for UAV Application Scenario

This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements for the UAV control vehicle use case, allowing operators to adjust radio resource allocation policies through the O-RAN architecture, reducing latency and improving radio resource utilization.

3.3.1	Background and goal of the use case

As shown in Figure 3.3.1-1, this scenario refers to a Rotor UAV flying at low altitude and low speed, and carrying cameras, sensors and other devices mounted. The Operation terminals work in the 5.8GHz to remote control the UAV for border/forest inspection, high voltage/base station inspection, field mapping, pollution sampling, and HD live broadcast. At the same time, the UAV mobile control stations and the anti-UAV weapons jointly provide the service of fighting against illegal UAVs to ensure low-altitude safety in special areas. The UAV Operation terminals, the anti-UAV weapons, and the UAV mobile control stations are connected with the UAV Control Vehicle using 5G network.

Figure 3.3.1-1:  UAV Control Vehicle Application scenario

UAV Control Vehicle deploys network equipment, including O-CU, O-DU, the Non-RT RIC function modules and Application Server (In this use case it is an Edge computing Service Platform) to provide reliable network services through 5G networks. The data transmitted over the network includes control data and application data. The control data includes navigation commands, configuration changes, flight status data reporting, etc. Control data requires low latency and low bandwidth requirements. The application data includes 4K high-definition video data, which has obvious uplink and downlink service asymmetry, and the uplink has high requirements on network bandwidth. The UAV Control Vehicle deploys edge computing services on the 5G gNB side to implement local processing of video and control information. At the same time, real-time data services can be provided with the third-party applications by a video server. The Near RT RIC function module provides radio resource management functions of the gNB side.

Figure 3.3.1-2: Network architecture for UAV Control Vehicle Application scenario

The 5G network supports real-time high-definition video transmission and remote low-latency control of UAV, and finally provides various industry services such as inspection, security, surveying and mapping. In the UAV Control Vehicle Application scenario, there are a small amount of control data interaction requirements between the terminal and the network interaction, as well as the large bandwidth requirements for uploading HD video.

The service asymmetry raises new requirements for resource allocation of the gNB. At the same time, the existing network operation and maintenance management platform (OSS system) can only optimize the parameters of a specific group of UEs, but not individual users. In the O-RAN architecture, the radio resource requirements for different terminals are sent to the gNB for execution by means of the RIC function module.

The UAV control vehicle has flexible layout features. In this use case, the application service and content is deployed on the edge computing platform instead of the core network; the RIC function module is used to schedule radio resources instead of the core network's QoS mechanism. In this way, the load and overhead of the core network can be reduced, the forwarding and processing time of data transmission can be reduced.

As shown in Figure 3.3.1-2, this scenario involves two options of network architecture. Option A is that gNB and Near-RT RIC are deployed on the Control Vehicle, Non-RT RIC and core network are deployed on the central cloud. The Control Vehicle is connected to the core network and NON RT RIC via fiber optics. Option B is a private network, all the modules, including the gNB, Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC and the necessary core network function modules, are deployed in the Control Vehicle.

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support real-time QoE optimization. Moreover, some high-level description and requirements over Non-RT RIC, A1 and E2 interfaces are introduced.

3.4.1	Background and goal of the use case

The highly demanding 5G native applications like Cloud VR are both bandwidth consuming and latency sensitive. However, for such traffic-intensive and highly interactive applications, current semi-static QoS framework can’t efficiently satisfy diversified QoE requirements especially taking into account potentially significant fluctuation of radio transmission capability. It is expected that QoE estimation/prediction from application level can help deal with such uncertainty and improve the efficiency of radio resources, and eventually improve user experience.

The main objective is to ensure QoE optimization be supported within the O-RAN architecture and its open interfaces. Multi-dimensional data, e.g., user traffic data, QoE measurements, network measurement report, can be acquired and processed via ML algorithms to support traffic recognition, QoE prediction, QoS enforcement decisions. ML models can be trained offline and model inference will be executed in a real-time manner.

3.5	Use case 5: Traffic Steering

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for traffic steering use case, allowing operators to specify different objectives for traffic management such as optimizing the network/UE performance, or achieving balanced cell load.

3.5.1	Background and goal of the use case

5G systems will support many different combinations of access technologies namely; LTE (licensed band), NR (licensed band), NR-U (unlicensed band), Wi-Fi (unlicensed band) [11]. Several different multi-access deployment scenarios are possible with 5GC to support wide variety of applications and satisfy the spectrum requirements of different service providers;

Carrier aggregation between licensed band NR (Primary Cell) and NR-U (Secondary Cell)

Dual connectivity between licensed band NR (Primary Cell) and NR-U (Secondary Cell)

Dual connectivity between licensed band LTE (Primary Cell) and NR-U (Secondary Cell)

Dual connectivity between licensed band NR (Primary Cell) and Wi-Fi (Secondary Cell)

Note: The scenario of dual connectivity between NR and Wi-Fi is for future study

The rapid traffic growth and multiple frequency bands utilized in a commercial network make it challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution. Further in a multi-access system there is need to switch the traffic across access technologies based on changes in radio environment and application requirements and even split the traffic across multiple access technologies to satisfy performance requirements. The different types of traffic and frequency bands in a commercial network make it challenging to handle the complex QoS aspects, bearer selection (Master Cell Group (MCG) bearer, Secondary Cell Group (SCG) bearer, Split bearer), bearer type change for load balancing, achieving low latency and best in class throughput in a multi-access scenario with 5GC networks [8]. Typical controls are limited to adjusting the cell reselection and handover parameters; modifying load calculations and cell priorities; and are largely static in nature when selecting the type of bearers and QoS attributes.

Further, the RRM (Radio Resource Management) features in the existing cellular network are all cell-centric. Even in different areas of within a cell, there are variations in radio environment, such as neighboring cell coverage, signal strength, interference status, etc. However, base stations based on traditional control strategies treat all UEs in a similar way and are usually focused on average cell-centric performance, rather than UE-centric.

Such current solutions suffer from following limitations:

It is hard to adapt the RRM control to diversified scenarios including multi-access deployments and optimization objectives.

The traffic management strategy is usually passive, rarely taking advantage of capabilities to predict network and UE performance. The strategy needs to consider aspects of steering, switching and splitting traffic across different access technologies in a multi-access scenario.

Non-optimal traffic management, with slow response time, due to various factors such as inability to select the right set of UEs for control action. This further results in non-optimal system and UE performance, such as suboptimal spectrum utilization, reduced throughput and increased handover failures.

Based on the above reasons, the main objective of this use case is to allow operators to flexibly configure the desired optimization policies, utilize the right performance criteria, and leverage machine learning to enable intelligent and proactive traffic management.

3.5.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

For example, the policy could relate to specifying different optimization objectives to guide the carrier/band preferences at per-UE or group of UE granularity.

3.6	Use case 6: Massive MIMO Beamforming Optimization

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for Massive MIMO beamforming long term optimization use case. Massive MIMO system configuration can allow operators to optimize the network performance and QoS by e.g. balancing cell loads or reducing inter-cell interference and control electromagnetic (EM) emissions.

3.6.1	Background and goal of the use case

Massive-MIMO (M-MIMO) is among the key levers to increase performance and QoS in 5G networks. Capacity enhancement is obtained by means of beamforming of the transmitted signals, and by spatially multiplexing data streams for both single user (SU) - and for multi user (MU) - MIMO. Beamforming increases the received signal power, while decreasing the interference generated on other users, hence resulting in higher SINR and user throughputs. Beamforming can be codebook based (mainly for FDD), or non-codebook based (TDD). Grid of Beams (GoB) with the corresponding beam sweeping [9][10] has been introduced to allow beamforming the control channels used during initial access, mainly for high frequency (but can be used also for the sub-6 GHz band) MIMO operation. The codebook and the GoB define the span of the beams, namely the horizontal and vertical aperture in which beamforming is supported, and therefore the coverage area and the shape of the cell. Massive MIMO can be deployed in 5G macro-cells as well as in heterogeneous network, where Macro-cells and 3D-MIMO small cells co-exist and complement each other for better aggregated capacity and coverage. In order to obtain an optimal beamforming and cell resources (Tx power, PRB) configuration, one will have to look at a multi-cell environment instead of a single cell.  Moreover, different vendors may have different implementations in terms of the number of beams, the horizontal/vertical beam widths, azimuth and elevation range, to achieve the desired coverage. In multi node / multi-vendor scenario, centralized monitoring and control is required to offer optimal coverage and capacity as control over EM emissions in order to comply with regulatory requirements. Additionally, the number of such combination of adjustable parameters is in the thousands, hence it is prohibitive for the traditional human expert system to work out the optimal configuration, and new method is in need.

State of the art solutions suffer from the following problems:

A Massive MIMO macro- or small-cells benefit from a flexible way of serving users in their coverage area thanks to beamforming. However the coverage area itself is defined by (vendor specific) fixed massive MIMO system parameters such as the azimuth and elevation angle range, or the GoB parameters. Hence due to traffic distribution and terrain topology, the Massive MIMO cell may suffer from e.g.

High inter-cell interference

Unbalanced traffic between neighboring cells

Low performance of cell edge users

Poor handover performance

Moreover, load balancing functions may be activated in the network nodes, e.g. gNB adapting mobility parameters in order to distribute load between the beams of the neighbor cells, relying on load information exchange over network interfaces. This approach however is partly limited by the cell footprint statically fixed at the initial configuration.

The objective of this use case is to allow the operator to flexibly configure Massive MIMO system parameters by means of policies, configuration or machine learning techniques, according to objectives defined by the operator.

3.7	Use case 7: RAN Sharing

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for RAN sharing use case. The goal of this use case is to enable multiple operators to share the same O-RAN infrastructure, while allowing them to remotely configure and control the shared resources via a remote O1, O2 and E2 interface.

3.7.1	Background and goal of the use case

RAN sharing is envisioned as an efficient and sustainable way to reduce the network deployment costs, while increasing network capacity and coverage. Among the different RAN sharing models that have been experimented so far, a special focus is put here on the evaluation of the compatibility of the “Geographical Split” RAN sharing model with the O-RAN architecture. In such a model, a coverage area is split between two or more operators; each operator manages the RAN in a specific area, while sharing its RAN infrastructure and computing resources with its partner operators.

Specifically, this use case analyzes the Multi Operator RAN (MORAN) sharing scenario, wherein each operator utilizes a separate carrier in order to achieve more freedom and independency on the control of the radio resources.   Accordingly, the goal of this use case is to propose a sharing-compliant O-RAN architecture that lets operators to configure the shared network resources independently from configuration and operating strategies of the other sharing operators. Specifically, it is proposed that a Home Operator (Operator A) makes available its O-RAN infrastructure and computing resources to host the virtual RAN functions (VNF) of a second operator (Operator B), allowing it to configure and control such remote VNFs via a remote O1, O2 and E2 interface.

Figure 3.7.1-1: MORAN Use-Case in O-RAN

Figure 3.7.1-1 describes the logic architecture of the proposed MORAN use case. It is assumed that Operator A owns the site A and shares the PHY Layer (LOW) with Operator B (Shared O-RU). Indeed, multiple PLMN IDs are broadcasted, while each operator operates in a different carrier. Moreover, the computing resources of the site A are shared among multiple VNFs, belonging to Operator A and Operator B, respectively.

Each VNF represents a logic implementation of the O-DU and O-CU functionalities and is controlled by each partner operator in an independent manner. While Operator A can directly orchestrate and configure its VNFs, Operator B needs to control its VNFs in a remoted manner. The challenge here is to enable Operator B to configure and control resources in an infrastructure that is owned by another operator.

Accordingly, it is assumed that Operator B can monitor and control the remote radio resources via the RIC node of site B, using an “E2 remote” interface. Note that in the proposed architecture, the RIC nodes are not shared and kept independent at the site A and B respectively.

However, it is assumed that Operator B cannot directly orchestrate its VNFs in site A, but it is allowed to communicate the desired initial VNF configuration via an extended O1, O2 interface, hereafter referred to as “O1, O2 + SLA” interface (O1, O2 remote).  Note that the O1, O2 nomenclature is used hereafter to refer to both O1 and O2 messages.

The “O1, O2 remote” interface is connected to a specific “sharing orchestration application”, referred to as “SMO-Sharing APP”, that is located at the Service Management & Orchestration Framework of each operator. Specifically the “SMO-Sharing APP” at site A acts as an SLA (Service Level Agreement) monitoring and filter entity: it checks that O1, O2 requests coming from Operator B are in line with a predefined SLA and finally configures the VNF of Operator B, according to the initial O1, O2 request.

3.7.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

SMO-Sharing APP (site A) :

SLA Monitoring: checks that orchestration/management requests sent by Operator B are in line with the SLA.

SMO-Sharing APP (site B) :

Detects the “SMO-Sharing-APP” in site A towards which to forward “O1, O2 remote” requests.

Sends “O1, O2 remote” commands for initial deployment and configuration of remote VNFs.

Forwards RAN related data of Operator B, collected in site A, to the Non-RT RIC.

IMF (Site A): Creates VNFs for Operator B in site A on initial request of the SMO-Sharing APP (site A).

RAN (site A):

Supports data collection from the hosted VNFs with radio state report over “E2 remote” interface.

Elaborates RAN data collected by “SMO-Sharing APP”, e.g., scheduling performance metrics, and sends A1 policy/intentions to the remote virtual O-DU/O-CU (VNF_B) via the near-RT RIC.

Near-RT RIC (site B):

Monitors and collects E2-related parameters from the remote VNFs.

Detects the “E2 remote” interface towards the VNFs hosted in site A.

B): execute remote E2 commands via “E2 remote” interface. RAN (Site A): collects and reports RAN statistics to the RIC of Operator B (RIC_B) for its VNFs hosted in site A.

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated.

A1, O1, O2, E2 interface connectivity is established with local SMO, Non-RT RIC and near-RT RIC, respectively.

“O1, O2 remote” and “E2 remote” end-to-end connectivity is established with remote SMO and remote near-RT RIC, respectively. The remote interfaces have been secured through appropriate end-to-end security mechanisms (security configuration details are out of scope of this use case).

Non-RT RIC_B and near-RT RIC_B are aware of the presence of O-DU_B and O-CU_B in the site A. Near-RT RIC_B is aware of the “E2 remote” interface, to be used to control the remote VNFs hosted in site A.

Pre conditions

An SLA sharing agreement is established between the home (Operator A) and host operator (Operator B). The SLA defines the amount of physical resources (CPU, memory, etc.), that can be allocated to the host operator and the type of admissible orchestration operations that can be remotely executed by the host operator. Such SLA is translated in appropriate SLA monitoring-check controls to be executed by the SMO-Sharing APP.

Begins when

Phase 3: Host Operator wants to send a new instruction to the shared RAN over the “E2 remote” interface.

Step 1 (M)

SMO-Sharing APP_B sends a request to SMO-sharing-APP_A for provisioning and deploying a remote virtual O-DU_B and O-CU_B in the site A.

Step 2 (M)

SMO-Sharing APP_A checks that the request is in line with the predefined SLA and ask the IMF (via the Orchestrator) to instantiate the VNFs for the O-CU_B and O-DU_B.

Step 3 (O)

IMF creates VNF for Operator B in site A as for the request of the SMO-Sharing APP_A.

Step 4 (M)

SMO-Sharing APP_B notifies SMO-Sharing APP_A the request to install a default network policy template, e.g., RB scheduling policy, in the remote VNFs.

Step 5 (M)

SMO-Sharing APP_A checks that Operator B request is in line with the SLA and configures (via the Orchestrator) the O-DU_B/ O-CU_B via an O1 configuration command.

Step 6 (M)

RAN related data from VNF_B in site A are collected at SMO Collector and forwarded to the SMO-Sharing APP_A, which in turns forwards them to the Non-RT RIC_B,  via the SMO-Sharing APP_B.

Step 7

Non-RT RIC_B decides to update the default network policy of the remote VNFs, e.g., scheduling policy of O-DU_B/O-CU_B and sends an A1 update policy request to the near-RT RIC_B.

Step 8

Near-RT RIC_B configures the remote O-DU_B/O-CU_B accordingly, over the “E2 remote” interface.

Ends when

The VNFs of Operator B in site A are instantiated with success and no update-requests are sent by the Host Operator (Operator B).

Exceptions

None identified.

Post Conditions

RIC of Operator B monitors relevant radio KPI from the remote O-CU_B and O-DU_B and decides to reconfigure the scheduling policy as for Step 7.

3.7.4	Required data

Multi-dimensional data are expected to be handled by the SMO-Sharing APP:

SLA data needs to be converted in a set of condition steps to be matched for each request of the Host Operator (Operator B).

SMO needs to handle O1, O2 messages sent by the Host Operator, converting them in local O1, O2 commands.

The RAN of the home operator needs to report to the RIC_B the network state of the served UEs that belong to the host operator.

3.8	Use case 8: QoS Based Resource Optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support RAN QoS based resource optimization. Moreover, some high-level description and requirements over Non-RT RIC and A1 interfaces are introduced.

3.8.1	Background and goal of the use case

QoS based resource optimization can used when the network has been configured to provide some kind of preferential QoS for certain users. One such scenario can be related to when the network has been configured to support e2e slices. In this case, the network has functionality that ensures resource isolation between slices as well as functionality to monitor that slice Service Level Specifications (SLS) are fulfilled.

In RAN, it is the scheduler that ensures that Physical Resource Block (PRB) resources are isolated between slices in the best possible way and also that the PRB resources are used in an optimal way to best fulfill the SLS for different slices. The desired default RAN behavior for slices is configured over O1. For example, the ratio of physical resources (PRBs) reserved for a slice is configured at slice creation (instantiation) over O1. Also, QoS can be configured to guide the RAN scheduler how to (in real-time) allocate PRB resources to different users to best fulfill the SLS of a specific slice. In the NR NRM this is described by the resource partition attribute.

Instantiation of a RAN sub-slice will be prepared by rigorous planning to understand to what extent deployed RAN resources will be able to support RAN sub-slice SLS. Part of this procedure is to configure RAN functionality according to above. With this, a default behavior of RAN is obtained that will be able to fulfill slice SLSs for most situations. However, even through rigorous planning, there will be times and places where the RAN resources are not enough to fulfill SLS given the default configuration. To understand how often (and where) this happens, the performance of a RAN slice will continuously be monitored by SMO. When SMO detects a situation when RAN SLS cannot be fulfilled, Non-RT RIC can use A1 policies to improve the situation. To understand how to utilize A1 policies and how to resolve the situation, the non RT-RIC will use additional information available in SMO.

Take an emergency service as an example of a slice tenant. For this example, it is understood (at slice instantiation) that 50% of the PRBs in an area should be enough to support the emergency traffic under normal circumstances. Therefore, the ratio of PRBs for the emergency users is configured to 50% as default behavior for the pre-defined group of users belonging to the emergency slice. Also, QoS is also configured in CN and RAN so that video cameras of emergency users get a minimum bitrate of 500 kbps.

Now, suppose a large fire is ongoing and emergency users are on duty. Some of the personnel capture the fire on video on site. The video streams are available to the Emergency Control Command. Because of the high traffic demand in the area from several emergency users (belonging to the same slice), the resources available for the Emergency slice is not enough to support all the traffic. In this situation, the operator has several possibilities to mitigate the situation. Depending on SLAs towards the Emergency slice compared to SLAs for other slices, the operator could reconfigure the amount of PRB reserved to Emergency slice at the expense of other slices. However, there is always a risk that Emergency video quality is not good enough irrespective if all resources are used for Emergency users. It might be that no video shows sufficient resolution due to resource limitations around the emergency site.

In this situation, the Emergency Control Command decides, based on the video content, to focus on a selected video stream to improve the resolution. The Emergency Control System gives the information about which users to up- and down-prioritized to the e2e slice assurance function (through e.g. an Edge API) of the mobile network to increase bandwidth for selected video stream(s). Given this additional information, the Non-RT RIC can influence how RAN resources are allocated to different users through a QoS target statement in an A1 policy. By good usage of the A1 policy, the Emergency Control Command can ensure that dynamically defined group of UEs provides the video resolution that is needed.

3.8.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Monitor necessary QoS related metrics from network function and other SMO functions

Send policies to near-RT RIC to drive QoS based resource optimization at RAN level in terms of expected behavior.

3.8.4	Required data

For this use case, different kind of observability need to be reported to Non-RT RIC. First Non-RT RIC should monitor resource consumption in the area. As long as resource consumption is low, the RAN scheduler will be able to give all users in an area the needed resources. When resource consumption in an area increases above a threshold, the risk of that the default configuration of RAN will not be enough to fulfil the requirements. At this point, the Non-RT RIC need to be able to configure more detailed reporting for individual UEs that the Non-RT RIC is interested in. This detailed observability should provide the Non RT RIC better insight in performance for specific users and therefore includes observability of e.g. user throughput and delay. With this more detailed observability, the Non-RT RIC can understand when pre-configured priorities are not enough for the scheduler to solve the problem and when additional (Non RAN) information to solve the prioritization is needed.

3.9	Use case 9: RAN Slice SLA Assurance

The 3GPP standards architected a sliceable 5G infrastructure which allows creation and management of customized networks to meet specific service requirements that may be demanded by future applications, services and business verticals. Such a flexible architecture needs different requirements to be specified in terms of functionality, performance and group of users which may greatly vary from one service to the other. The 5G standardization efforts have gone into defining specific slices and their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on application/service type [3]. Since network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes the core network, the transport network and the radio access network (RAN), these requirements should be met at any slice subnet during the life-time of a network slice [4], especially in RAN side. Exemplary slice performance requirements are defined in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, latency and reliability at a high level in SDOs such as 3GPP [2] and GSMA [15]. These requirements are defined as a reference for SLA/contractual agreements for each slice, which individually need proper handling in NG-RAN.

Although network slicing support is started to be defined with 3GPP Release 15, slice assurance mechanisms in RAN needs to be further addressed to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN environment. It is necessary to assure the SLAs by dynamically controlling slice configurations based on slice specific performance information. Existing RAN performance measurements [6] and information model definitions [5] are not enough to support RAN slice SLA assurance use cases. This use case is intended to clarify necessary mechanisms and parameters for RAN slice SLA assurance.

3.9.1	Background and goal of the use case

In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific business requirements. These requirements include customizable network capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G standardization efforts, the 5G system should support the needs of the business through the specification of several service needs such as data rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN’s open interfaces and AI/ML based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

Step 4a or 4b is Mandatory

Step 4b

In case of using the control app, the control app is deployed by SMO to Non-RT RIC for slow loop optimization and/or Near-RT RIC via O2 for fast loop optimization.

Step 5 (M)

Non-RT RIC receives feedback internally or from Near-RT RIC via A1 to update the model or control apps based on it.

O1 interfaces are established between SMO and Near-RT RIC, and SMO and RAN nodes.

RAN slice SLA assurance models or control apps have been deployed in Near-RT RIC.

Begins when

A RAN slice is activated

Step 1

Non-RT RIC decides to generate a policy for Near-RT RIC slice SLA assurance based on RAN slice SLA requirements and/or operator-defined RAN intents, A1 feedback from Near-RT RIC, EI from external app server and O1 based long term trends.

Step 2

Near-RT RIC receives slice specific O1 configuration and A1 policies from SMO and Non-RT RIC respectively. The former is static and default, the latter is dynamic, optimized and converted from slice SLA. The policies consist of scope identifiers (e.g. S-NSSAI, Flow ID, Cell ID) and policy statements (e.g. slice specific KPI targets).

In case of using EIs, Near-RT RIC also receives the EIs from Non-RT RIC via A1-EI interface.

Step 3

	Near-RT RIC starts to collect PMs via E2. Examples of the PMs are CSI, PRB usage, L2 throughput, RAN latency, etc. Applicable PMs are defined in [6].

Step 4

The model or control app in Near-RT RIC analyzes collected PMs, A1 policies from Non-RT RIC (and optionally EIs from A1-EI interface) to guide RAN nodes via E2 to meet the slice SLA.

Step 5

Near-RT RIC sends A1 feedback to Non-RT RIC.

3.10	Use case 10: Multi-vendor Slices

This use case “Multi-vendor slices” is a case that vO-DU and vO-CU functions composing each slice is provided from different vendor. In this sub section, concept, motivation and benefits of introducing “Multi-vendor slices” are explained and candidate solutions are studied.

3.10.1	Background and goal of the use case

Proposed use case enables multiple slices with functions provided from multi- vendors, such as slice #1 is composed with DU and CU provided from vendor A and slice #2 is composed with DU and CU provided from vendor B.

Figure 3.10.1-1: Multi-vendor Slices

When providing multiple slices, it is assumed that suitable vO-DU/scheduler and vO-CU treat each slice respectively. A vendor who providing vO-DU and vO-CU function may have a strength of a customized scheduler for a certain service. With accomplishment of multi-vendor circumstances, following benefits can be expected.

More flexible and time to market deployment

Operator can maximize options to choose suitable vO-DU/scheduler and vO-CU to offer various slice. For example, some vendor has a strength of a scheduler for eMBB service and the other has a strength of scheduler for URLLC service. Or, vendor A can provide vO-DU/scheduler and vO-CU suitable for URLLC earlier than vendor B, therefore operator can choose vO-DU and vO-CU functions from vendor A to meet their service requirement.

Also, when operator will add a new service/slice, new functions from a new vendor can be introduced with less consideration for existing vendor if multi-vendor circumstance was realized. This may lead to expand vendor’s business opportunities rapidly.

Flexible deployment when sharing RAN equipment among operators

When operators want to share RAN equipment and resources, RAN vendors and their placement of each RAN functions may be different. If multi-vendor circumstance was introduced, then it can relax restrictions among operators to share RAN equipment and resources. This may lead to expand opportunity reaching agreement of RAN sharing among operators. With expansion of RAN sharing, CAPEX and OPEX by operator will be optimized and additional investment can be done more.

Reducing supply chain risk

If existing vendor providing a certain pair of vO-DU and vO-CU functions would withdraw of their market due to business reason, operator can deploy new vO-DU and vO-CU functions alternatively from other vendor under this multi-vendor circumstance. This can reduce a risk for operators’ business continuity.

3.10.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

SMO Multi-vendor Slice App:

Configures vO-DU and vO-CU

Configures O-RU to connect to vO-DU

Near-RT RIC:

Shares MAC related data unique for UE among vO-DUs.

Support communication of configuration parameters to RAN

E2 Nodes (vO-CU, vO-DU, O-RU):

Primary vO-DU processes SRB (Signalling Radio Bearer), DRB (Data Radio Bearer) and other vO-DU related functions. Secondary vO-DU processes only DRB related functions. Note that vO-DU and vO-CU are created as part of network slice creation procedure.

Primary vO-DU processes SRB (Signalling Radio Bearer), DRB (Data Radio Bearer). Secondary vO-DU processes only DRB.

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated.

Slice #1 is created over primary vO-DU and vO-CU with Logical Channel ID #1 and #2, and slice #2 is created over secondary vO-DU and vO-CU with Logical Channel ID #3.

O-RU is shared between primary vO-DU and secondary vO-DU with one component carrier.

CU-CP is shared between primary vO-CU-UP and secondary vO-CU-UP.

3.11	Use case 11: Dynamic Spectrum Sharing

This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements to realize Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) over the ORAN architecture. This is to enable operators to adapt radio resource allocation policies and control to dynamically share radio spectrum between 4G and 5G networks.

3.11.1	Background and goal of the use case

As we transition from 4G to 5G, the spectral resources used for 5G deployment is a key consideration and this situation varies from one operator to another. Though, new C-band resources between 3-6 GHz and mmWave bands have been acquired by operators, these bands suffer from great propagation and penetration loss, limiting their coverage to those users close to the cell, this situation worsens in the UL as the UE device is power constrained. A cost-effective way to address this is the 5G deployment on lower bands (i.e., below 2GHz), which are also used in 4G LTE deployments today. Operating on lower bands along with non-standalone mode of 5G deployment helps to cover large geography, enables seamless mobility between 4G and 5G while being sensitive to overall cost of deployment. In addition, DSS offers the advantage of dynamically sharing the available spectrum adapting to the varying workloads of the 4G and 5G network.

DSS is compelling considering the need for operators to dynamically share already deployed spectral resources between LTE and NR devices without degrading the QoE of the current 4G subscribers while offering the same level of coverage and necessary QoS to NR devices, under the assumption that the two networks will co-exist in the near term. The objective of this use case is to propose DSS in the context of the ORAN architecture, specifically to realize it as an application in the RIC framework.

This would particularly benefit vRAN implementations when the 4G/5G CU/DU are from different vendors and one could leverage RAN data over O-RAN’s framework for traffic prediction, DSS related resource management and conduct control functions. Towards this, the intelligent control functions are identified, which can be realized as a DSS application to augment the L3/L2/L1 control functions defined as part of LTE-NR coexistence in Rel-15/16 [3][8].

In Figure 3.11.1-1, the architectural context is set for this discussion. DSS enables 4G and 5G UEs to operate over the same spectrum identified as X (typically low band), while 5G itself could operate on new bands Y (typically high band) not used by current 4G deployment. In a typical setting, Y would offer higher capacity, low latency and smaller coverage, while X would be used to offer reasonable capacity along with larger coverage. 3GPP specifications offers DSS support over X2/Xn interface to enable dynamic sharing of the spectrum resource in addition to the L2/L1 adaptation for 5G-NR to co-exist with LTE.

Considering the scenario of incremental deployment - in the 5G NSA mode, the 5G UE is required to have dual connectivity capability and be able to connect to eNBs on LTE bands for control plane requirements and user plane connectivity towards the LTE and/or 5G depending on deployment requirements. In the scenario where gNB only operates on 5G C or mmWave bands, the sharing of the LTE frequency band between 4G and 5G UEs can be solely fulfilled by eNB MAC scheduler, as the UE is expected to be dual stacked. While, if the gNB is required to operate on lower LTE bands as well, then spectral sharing needs to be coordinated between the LTE and 5G schedulers.

When DSS is enabled in the SA mode, 5G UE would be capable of operating on lower LTE bands (below 2GHz), C and mmWave bands and connects only to the gNBs. The sharing of the LTE bands between LTE and 5G data channels are achieved by both 4G scheduler and 5G scheduler using resource management and interference mitigation functions in the RIC between them.

The use case proposes to conduct DSS related policy, configuration, resource management and control functions using the non-RT and near-RT functions over open interfaces proposed by ORAN.

An abstracted view of how DSS application can be realized using the Non-Real Time and Near-Real Time RIC components is shown in Figure 3.11.1-2. The DSS over RIC can be realized as multiple applications considering its multiple optimization and operational objectives. One possible logical breakdown is as a traffic prediction and resource management application (DSS-App) managing the shared spectrum resource adapting to dynamic 4G and 5G specific workload requirements in various local contexts, and another application (RAT-App) to configure, control and monitor DSS related functions in the CU/DU corresponding to the LTE and 5G cells. The DSS-App engineers at the non-RT RIC level translates the global DSS policies based on workload requirements for a region and time-of-day to spectrum sharing policies such as max/min bandwidth threshold at a local level (e.g. edge or central office). The RAT-App at the non-RT RIC level also translates the DSS-App’s resource policies to RAT specific configuration and policies at the near-RT RIC and the CU/DU entities. The DSS-App at the near-RT RIC uses the data collected by the RAT-app to make dynamic resource sharing decisions that are enforced by the RAT-app using the E2 control APIs.

Figure 3.11.1-1: RIC Based DSS Architecture

Figure 3.11.1-2: RIC Based DSS Realization

The main goal of the non-RT DSS-App is to provide long-term scheduling policy to 4G and 5G scheduler considering business, user, spatial and temporal workload factors.

The main functionality of non-RT RAT-App is to translate the global DSS policies from non-RT DSS-App to RAT specific policies to the RAT-App in the near-RT RIC over A1.

The main functionalities of the near-RT DSS-App include policy translation between non-RT DSS-App to RAT specific configuration to the near-RT RAT-App. Furthermore, it is actively involved in closed loop decision using the KPIs from the RAN adapting to the needs of the 4G and 5G cells.

The main functionality of near-RT RAT-App is to perform RAT specific configuration, control and data subscription over E2 interface with RAN (CU/DU components).

3.12	Use case 12: NSSI Resource Allocation Optimization

This use case provides the background, motivation, description, and requirements for the NSSI resource allocation optimization use case, allowing operators to optimize the allocation resources to NSSI(s) with wide range service requirements.

3.12.1	Background and goal of the use case

5G networks are becoming increasingly complex with the densification of millimeter wave small cells, and various new services, such as eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications), and mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications) that are characterized by high speed high data volume, low speed ultra-low latency, and infrequent transmitting low data volume from huge number of emerging smart devices, respectively. It is a challenging task for 5G networks to allocate resources dynamically and efficiently among multiple network nodes to support the various services. However, as eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC services in 5G are typically realized as NSI (Network Slice instance). Therefore, the resources allocated to NSSI (Network Slice Subnet Instance) to support the O-RAN nodes can be optimized according the service requirements.

As the new 5G services have different characteristics, the network traffic tends to be sporadic, where there may be different usage pattern in terms of time, location, UE distribution, and types of applications. For example, most IoT sensor applications may run during off-peak hours or weekends. Special events, such as sport games, concerts, can cause traffic demand to shoot up at certain time and locations. Therefore, NSSI resource allocation optimization function trains the AI/ML model, based on the huge volume of performance data collected over days, weeks, months from O-RAN nodes. It then uses the AI/ML model to predict the traffic demand patterns of 5G networks in different times and locations for each network slice, and automatically re-allocates the network resources ahead of the network issues surfaced.

Figure 3.12.1-1 shows the NSSI resource allocation Optimization on the Non-RT RIC, and may consist of the following steps:

Monitoring: monitor the radio network(s) by collecting data via the O1 interface, for example including the following performance measurements that are measured on per NSSI (TS 28.552 [6]):

DL PRB used for data traffic

UL PRB used for data traffic

Average DL UE throughput in gNB

Average UL UE throughput in gNB

Number of PDU Sessions requested to setup

Number of PDU Sessions successfully setup

Number of PDU Sessions failed to setup

Analysis & Decision: analyse the data to train the AI/ML model, and then determine the actions needed to add or reduce the resources (e.g. capacity, VNF resources, slice subnet attributes (TS 28.541 [5]), etc.) for the NSSI at the given time, and location.

Execution: execute the actions to reallocate the NSSI resources that include:

3a. Re-configure the NSSI attributes via the O1 interface

3b. Update the cloud resources via the O2 interface

Figure 3.12.1-1: The realization of NSSI resource allocatıon optimization over Non-RT RIC

3.12.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Collect the performance measurements related to NSSI resource usage from the O-RAN nodes via the O1 interface.

Train the AI/ML model based on the analysis of historical performance measurements, to predict of the traffic demand patterns of NSSI at different times and locations.

Determine the time/date and locations (i.e. which O-RAN nodes) to add or reduce the resources (e.g. capacity, VNF resources, slice subnet attributes (TS 28.541 [5]), etc.) for a given NSSI based on inference.

Perform the following action(s) to optimize the NSSI resource allocation, at the time determined by the model.

Re-configure the NSSI attributes via the O1 interface

Update the cloud resources via the O2 interface

RAN Nodes (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, O-RU):

Support the performance measurement collection with required granularity over O1 interface.

Annex A (informative): Additional Information

A.1	Traffic Steering use case A1 interface usage example

Note: Please refer to WG2 Use Cases and Requirements Specification for more details and up to date definitions of this use case A1 interface usage examples.

An example scenario is here used to describe the use of A1 for traffic steering, implying the Non-RT RIC sending policies for allocation of the control plane (RRC) and the user plane for different services, identified by their 5QI.

In the scenario a UE with UEid=1, belonging to a subnet slice identified by S-NSSAI=1, having a Voice (5QI=1) and an MBB (5QI=9) connection established, enters an area covered by four frequency bands. The Non-RT RIC understands the requirements and characteristics of the services and decides to let the Voice and RRC connection reside on the low band (here covered by a macro cell B becoming the PCell), while the MBB connection should preferably use the higher band (here provided by a smaller cell C and D becoming the SCells) and avoid the low band if possible. Cell A is used for MBB if required for coverage reasons.

Policies are sent to any cell of concern, e.g. where the UE resides and may move.

Figure A.1-1 Desired use of the cells

Two policies over A1 are needed to accomplish the desired behavior, described in JSON format below. Note that as part of the scope, the cell_id is optional, and if omitted it is up to the Near-RT RIC to locate the UE and there enforce the policy.
