1.3	Definitions and Abbreviations

1.3.1	Definitions

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].

A1 policy: Type of declarative policies expressed using formal statements that enable the non-RT RIC function in the SMO to guide the near-RT RIC function, and hence the RAN, towards better fulfilment of the RAN intent.

A1 Enrichment information: Information utilized by near-RT RIC that is collected or derived at SMO/non-RT RIC either from non-network data sources or from network functions themselves.

A1-Policy Based Traffic Steering Process Mode: An operational mode in which the Near-RT RIC is configured through A1 Policy to use Traffic Steering Actions to ensure a more specific notion of network performance (for example, applying to smaller groups of E2 Nodes and UEs in the RAN) than that which it ensures in the Background Traffic Steering.

Background Traffic Steering Processing Mode: An operational mode in which the Near-RT RIC is configured through O1 to use Traffic Steering Actions to ensure a general background network performance which applies broadly across E2 Nodes and UEs in the RAN.

Baseline RAN Behavior: The default RAN behavior as configured at the E2 Nodes by SMO

E2:  Interface connecting the Near-RT RIC and one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, one or more O-DUs, and one or more O-eNBs.

E2 Node: a logical node terminating E2 interface. In this version of the specification, O-RAN nodes terminating E2 interface are:

-	for NR access: O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU or any combination;

-	for E-UTRA access: O-eNB.

FCAPS: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security.

Intents: A declarative policy to steer or guide the behavior of RAN functions, allowing the RAN function to calculate the optimal result to achieve stated objective.

Non-RT RIC (O-RAN non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller): a logical function that enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources, AI/ML workflow including model training and updates, and policy-based guidance of applications/features in Near-RT RIC.

Near-RT RIC (O-RAN near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller): a logical function that enables near-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained (e.g. UE basis, Cell basis) data collection and actions over E2 interface.

RAN UE Group: Aggregations of UEs whose grouping is set in the E2 nodes through E2 procedures also based on the scope of A1 policies.  These groups can then be the target of E2 CONTROL or POLICY messages.

Traffic Steering Action: The use of a mechanism to alter RAN behavior. Such actions include E2 procedures such as CONTROL and POLICY.

Traffic Steering Inner Loop: The part of the Traffic Steering processing, triggered by the arrival of periodic TS related KPM (Key Performance Measurement) from E2 Node, which includes UE grouping, setting additional data collection from the RAN, as well as selection and execution of one or more optimization actions to enforce Traffic Steering policies.

Traffic Steering Outer Loop: The part of the Traffic Steering processing, triggered by the Near-RT RIC setting up or updating Traffic Steering aware resource optimization procedure based on information from A1 Policy setup or update, A1 Enrichment Information (EI) and/or outcome of Near-RT RIC evaluation, which includes the initial configuration (preconditions) and injection of related A1 policies, Triggering conditions for TS changes.

Traffic Steering Processing Mode: An operational mode in which either the RAN or the Near-RT RIC is configured to ensure a particular network performance.  This performance includes such aspects as cell load and throughput, and it can apply differently to different E2 nodes and UEs.  Throughout this process, Traffic Steering Actions are used to fulfill the requirements of this configuration.

Traffic Steering Target: The intended performance result that is desired from the network, which is configured to Near-RT RIC over O1.

Objective

This document provides O-RAN WG3 Near-RT RIC Use Cases and Requirements, including E2 interface.

Use cases

3.1	Use case 1: Traffic Steering

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for near RT RIC and E2 interface to support Traffic Steering, whose end-to-end requirements are defined in [23].

3.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

The rapid traffic growth and multiple frequency bands utilized in a commercial network make it challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution. Typical controls are limited to adjusting the cell reselection and handover parameters; and modifying load calculations and cell priorities.

The goal of Near-RT RIC Traffic Steering is to interpret the Policies received over A1 and to determine the optimum changes it can make towards achieving those goals. It may also leverage the A1 enrichment information.  Traffic Steering may reuse mechanisms provided by other use cases to effect the changes necessary to achieve its goals.

More specifically, Near-RT RIC triggers E2 procedure and related control/policies so as to obtain network performance that would fulfill the criteria identified in the A1 policies.

3.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

OAM Functions in SMO domain:

Collect necessary measurement metrics from network level measurement report and enrichment data (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models

Deploy or update, configure the relevant TS optimization AI/ML models to Near-RT RIC via O1.

Non-RT RIC in SMO domain:

Send A1 policies and receive policy feedback to/from Near-RT RIC to drive resource optimization at RAN level.

E.g. TS targets as defined in [25]

Near-RT RIC:

Supports update of AI/ML models from SMO.

Supports inference, such as traffic prediction, using AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC based on network data, e.g. measurement reports from E2 Node.

Supports interpretation and execution of A1 policies from Non-RT RIC.

Sends TS resource optimization related policies and commands to E2 Node to influence RRM behavior.

Sends the relevant A1 policy feedback to Non-RT RIC for potential policy update.

Sends the relevant O1 performance data to OAM Functions; these may be used by Non-RT RIC for potential policy update

E2 Node:

Supports reporting of UE context, network measurements, and UE measurements to Near-RT RIC over E2 interface.

Executes policies and commands received from Near-RT RIC over E2 interface

Supports network and UE performance report to OAM Functions in SMO domain over O1 interface.

3.1.3	Solutions

In this section the possible processing modes of Traffic Steering are described. Figure 3.1.3-1 shows three general Traffic Steering processing modes and the transitions between them.

These modes represent the way the Near-RT RIC (or RAN) operates on a given group of UEs, and not the operation of any component as a whole.  As such, the Near-RT RIC, could be operating in both modes 1 and 2 concurrently for different sets of UEs.  For example, the transition from Mode 0 or 1 to 2 occurs only for a group of UE defined by the A1 policy Scope. At the same time, other UE groups may still be handled in Mode 0 and/or 1.

Figure 3.1.3-1: Traffic Steering Processing Modes

The three processing modes are described in more detail below:

“Baseline” Traffic Steering Behavior: OAM Functions in SMO domain uses O1 configuration on one or more E2 node to set up a desired baseline behavior.  This also sets up baseline Performance Monitoring of E2 Node by the SMO. In this mode, Near-RT RIC is not involved.

“Background” Near-RT RIC Processing: OAM Functions in SMO domain uses O1 configuration of near-RT RIC to set up a desired “background near-RT RIC behavior”.  In this mode the near-RT RIC sets up E2 mechanisms to monitor E2 Node and uses Traffic Steering related E2 mechanisms to achieve the desired background behavior of the set of E2 Nodes connected to the near-RT RIC.

“A1-Policy based” Near-RT RIC Processing: This mode may be entered from either Mode 0 or Mode 1.  Non-RT RIC in SMO domain uses A1-P to specify an A1 guided behavior for a targeted subset of E2 Nodes or UEs. If entering this from Mode 1, this will have the effect of modifying the existing near-RT RIC “background” behavior to include a more specific A1 guided behavior.  In this mode, the near-RT RIC may either set up or modify E2 mechanisms used to monitor E2 Nodes and will use Traffic Steering related E2 mechanisms to obtain the desired behavior of some targeted sub-set of E2 Nodes or UEs.  This mode terminates when the corresponding A1-P Policy Delete message is received from Non-RT RIC in SMO domain and the system returns to either Mode 0 or Mode 1, depending on whether or not OAM Functions in SMO domain had previously configured the optional Near-RT RIC “background” role (Mode 1).

Note 1: Processing Mode 0 is strictly not in scope for WG3.  It is described here for completeness and to clearly state what is the starting point prior to the WG2 and WG3 defined mechanisms.

Processing Mode 2 contain an ‘outer loop’ and an ‘inner loop’.  In the inner loop, a number of different “E2 mechanism” may be used (Policy, Report/Control or Insert/Control) towards a number of different target RAN functions in order to either exercise existing RAN mechanisms or modifying their ongoing behavior.  The appropriate mechanism and target RAN Function would depend upon the RAN Function capabilities to support a given E2 mechanism, the A1-P scope and policy, the O1 configuration of the RIC and the performance observed through E2 monitoring.

Related use

Goal

Drive traffic management in RAN in accordance with defined intents, policies, and enrichment information from the Non-RT RIC using A1 interface

Actors and Roles

OAM Functions in SMO domain: Performance data and training data collection, AI Model management

Non-RT RIC in SMO domain: Creates and updates A1 policies, AI model training targeting to TS optimization

Near-RT RIC: Enforces A1 policies and generates RIC CONTROL and/or POLICY

E2 Node: RIC CONTROL and POLICY execution and RIC REPORT creation

Refer to 3.1.2 for more details.

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated.

A1, O1 and E2 interface connectivity is established.

A1 Policy scope defined

Pre conditions

Network is operational with default configuration.

OAM Functions have configured a baseline measurement configuration and the Non-RT RIC has access to this data

(optional) OAM Functions have configured Traffic Steering targets in near-RT RIC through O1 interface

OAM Functions have configured baseline traffic steering parameters in E2 Node(s) through O1 interface

(optional) Near-RT RIC has access to the necessary data related to traffic steering from the E2 node by means of a RIC Report procedure

Non-RT RIC analyzes the historical data from RAN for training the relevant AI/ML models to be deployed or updated in the near-RT RIC, as well as AI/ML models required for non-real-time optimization of configuration and policies.

 Begins when

Non-RT RIC and/or Near-RT RIC perform data evaluation, determine that TS-aware optimization is required to be initiated or updated and establishes target(s).

Step 1 (O)

(Start of Outer loop control)

Non-RT RIC evaluates the collected data and A1 policy feedback, if required, and generates or updates the appropriate TS-aware resource optimization policy, such as TS targets, and sends it to Near-RT RIC via A1 interface.

Step 2 (O)

Non-RT RIC sends optional traffic steering related A1 Enrichment Information

Step 3 (M)

Based on received A1 policy and/or A1-EI from Non-RT RIC or internal trigger and/or internal evaluation and trigger, Near-RT RIC sets up or updates the TS-aware resource optimization procedure.

Step 4 (M)

Near-RT RIC subscribes to a UE context information and measurement metrics via E2 interface.

Step 5 (M)

(Start of Inner loop control)

E2 Nodes report the UE context information and E2 measurements via RIC REPORT periodically or event-triggered.

Step 6 (M)

Near-RT RIC evaluates the performance data from E2 Nodes (including performance data from different E2 Nodes for the same UE) and finds the performance is out of TS targets which are indicated in the A1 policy and/or internal near-RT RIC TS targets.

Step 7 (M)

Based on the UE context information, E2 measurement metrics (RIC REPORT), and A1 policy, Near-RT RIC may generate new or modify the existing E2 policies and sends them to E2 Nodes. Near-RT RIC may also generate control command(s) and send them to E2 Node(s) to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that TS indicators can move back to the limits outlined in the A1 policies.

E2 node functions target of E2 policy and control commands may be:

E-UTRAN-NR Dual Connectivity

Carrier Aggregation

Connected mode mobility

Idle Mode Mobility

Step 4 to Step 7 may repeat. (End of Inner loop control)

Step 8 (O)

If required, Near-RT RIC sends information to the SMO domain using A1 policy feedback and/or O1-PM.  The Non-RT RIC may use this information and information collected from E2 Nodes using O1-PM as policy feedback to assess the performance of TS optimization function in Near-RT RIC, or to assess the outcome of the applied A1 policies. Subsequently, an A1 policy can be updated.

In parallel, the Near-RT RIC may use available information to assess the performance of TS optimization function in Near-RT RIC, and/or to assess the outcome of the applied A1 policies. Subsequently, Near-RT RIC TS optimization targets can be updated

Step 1 to Step 8 may repeat (End of Outer loop control)

Ends when

Non-RT RIC decides to delete TS-aware resource optimization policy and sends the related message or following internal trigger, the Near-RT RIC terminates the TS-aware resource optimization procedure.

Exceptions

None

Post Conditions

Non-RT RIC continues to collect and monitor TS related measurement data from E2 Node.

Near-RT RIC continues to collect and monitor TS related measurement data from E2 Node.

Figure 3.1.3.1-1: The overall procedure for Near RT RIC A1-Policy based Traffic Steering Use Case

3.1.4	Required data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the Traffic Steering use case. The requirements are specified in Section 4.

3.1.4.1 Control over E2

Mobility Control: serving cell can be chosen based on the resource status and QoS of the UE(s) targeted by an A1 Traffic steering policy. Moreover, load balancing can be achieved to improve the overall network performance. The following procedures can be used for Traffic Steering:

Handover from the source cell to the target cell

Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list

Configuration of idle mode mobility parameters

Enable, disable, or modify CA (3GPP TS 38.300[15], 3GPP TS 36.300[9], 3GPP TS 38.473[22], 3GPP TS 38.331[19], 3GPP TS 36.331[12] )

Enable, disable, or modify Dual Connectivity (3GPP TS 38.300[15], 3GPP TS 36.300[9], 3GPP TS 37.340[14], 3GPP TS 38.473[22], 3GPP TS 38.331[19], 3GPP TS 36.331[12] )

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

3.1.4.2	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID (as defined in [24])

Slice level: S-NSSAI

DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.

QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).

UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used to derive the QoS requirements and the resource occupation; the UE capabilities may be required to select the appropriate RRM action (e.g. CA/DC configuration).

3.1.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the Traffic Steering use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g. handover control, DC, CA, idle mode mobility) by taking into account the RAN resource utilization, cell level and the UE level performance, the radio conditions, etc.

	The following lists the examples of measurement information identified as required:

3.1.4.4 E2 node Configuration

Cell level configuration parameters, such as PCI, neighbor relations and related offsets etc. are needed at Near-RT RIC in order to e.g. configure UE measurements monitor cell level performance and manage mobility control (handover and cell reselection) according to the network topology and the related E2 parameters.

3.2	Use case 2: QoS Based Resource Optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support near real-time QoS aware resource optimization.

Based on the end-to-end requirements for the QoS based resource optimization use case defined in [23] section 3.8, some high-level functional descriptions and requirements over Near-RT RIC and E2 interface are introduced.

3.2.1	Background and goal of the use case

The network must offer means to prioritize resources while preserving the required QoS properties, e.g. reliability, latency, bandwidth requirements, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [3]. Current RAN network coverage and capacity depends on rigorous planning and configuration. However, due to varying nature of traffic demands and radio channels as well as multiple services to co-exist, it is hard to satisfy all QoS requirements simultaneously.

In summary, it is important for an E2 Node to achieve QoS targets as smoothly as possible. The QoS aware resource optimization should provide a refined granularity of radio resource allocation based on varying radio conditions and traffics in order to meet the diverse requirements of reliability, latency, and bandwidth simultaneously. In addition, it should coordinate allocation of radio resources for co-existing multiple services, which may have different priorities, to achieve the optimal utilization of radio resources.

In case when the network performance data is observed outside the boundary of the defined QoS targets, the Near-RT RIC should be able to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that the QoS indicators can move back within limits outlined in the A1 policies.

3.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

OAM Functions in SMO domain:

Collect necessary measurement metrics from network level measurement report and enrichment data (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models

Deploy or update, configure the relevant QoS optimization AI/ML models to Near-RT RIC via O1.

Goal

QoS-aware resource optimization in E2 Nodes in accordance with A1 policies and O1 configuration.

Actors and Roles

OAM Functions in SMO domain: Performance data and training data collection, AI Model training targeting to QoS optimization

Non-RT RIC in SMO domain: Creates and updates A1 policies

Near-RT RIC: Enforces A1 policies and generates RIC CONTROL and/or POLICY

E2 Node: RIC CONTROL and POLICY execution and RIC REPORT creation

Refer to 3.2.2 for more details.

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated and configured.

A1, O1, E2 interface connectivity is established.

Pre conditions

Network is operational with default configuration.

OAM Functions have established RAN data collection, and Non-RT RIC has access to this data.

Non-RT RIC analyzes the history data from RAN and triggers SMO to train the relevant AI/ML models which are deployed or updated in Near-RT RIC via O1 interface.

Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC have exchanged capabilities for the support of QoS-aware resource optimization.

Begins when

QoS-aware optimization policy is required to be initiated or updated.

Step 1 (O)

(Start of Outer loop control)

Non-RT RIC evaluates the collected data and A1 policy feedback, if required, and generates or updates the appropriate QoS-aware resource optimization policy, such as QoS targets, and sends it to Near-RT RIC via A1 interface.

Step 2 (M)

When Near-RT RIC receives an A1 policy from Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC initiates the corresponding optimization procedure.

Step 3 (M)

(Start of Inner loop control)

Near-RT RIC subscribes to an UE context information and measurement metrics via E2 interface.

Step 4 (M)

E2 Nodes report the UE context information and E2 measurements via RIC REPORT periodically or event-triggered.

Step 5 (M)

Near-RT RIC evaluates the performance data from E2 Nodes (including performance data from different E2 Nodes for the same UE) and finds the performance is out of QoS targets which are indicated in the A1 policy. If performance is within the targets, Near-RT RIC keeps monitoring.

Step 6 (M)

Based on the UE context information, E2 measurement metrics (RIC REPORT), and A1 policy, Near-RT RIC may generate new or modify the existing E2 policies and sends them to E2 Nodes. Near-RT RIC may also generate control command(s) and send them to E2 Node(s) to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that QoS indicators can move back to the limits outlined in the A1 policies.

Step 3 to Step 6 may repeat. (End of Inner loop control)

Step 7 (O)

If required, Near-RT RIC sends a policy feedback to Non-RT RIC to assess the performance of QoS optimization function in Near-RT RIC, or to assess the outcome of the applied A1 policies. Subsequently, an A1 policy can be updated.

Step 1 to Step 7 may repeat (End of Outer loop control)

Ends when

Non-RT RIC decides to delete QoS-aware resource optimization policy and sends the related message to Near-RT RIC.

3.2.4	Required data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the QoS based resource optimization use case. The requirements are specified in Section 4.

3.2.4.1 Control over E2

DRB Control: RB control can be applied for modification of the following QoS properties:

DRB QoS modification (TS 38.473 [22], TS 23.501 [4]): The DRB level QoS may be tuned to accommodate A1 policy requirement.

QoS flow remapping (TS 38.473 [22]): The mapping relationship between QoS flows and DRBs may be adjusted.

Logical channel reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): The relevant parameters can be considered, e.g., priority, prioritized bit rate, bucket size duration, etc.

Radio Admission Control (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): DRB admission control such as reject or release may be applied.

Modification of dual-connectivity DRB (TS 37.340 [14]): change of bearer termination point (MN or SN) and/or bearer types (MCG/SCG/split), and control of split ratio for a split bearer.

Activation and deactivation of packet duplication and configuration of the number of legs in DC, CA, or DC+CA scenarios (TS 36.300 [9], TS 38.300 [15]).

RIC CONTROL (e.g. request for QoS flow remapping) or RIC POLICY (e.g. DRB admission policy) can be applicable.

Radio Resource Allocation, such as configuration of DRX, semi-persistent scheduling (SPS), or guidance for the scheduling and rate selection in MAC. For example, based on prediction, an E2 policy or control to reconfigure SPS configuration or ConfiguredGrantConfig for UL may be generated.

DRX reconfiguration (TS 38.473 [22], TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): Long DRX cycle length, Short DRX cycle length as well as short DRX cycle timer can be considered.

SR periodicity reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): Both sr-ProhibitTimer and sr-TransMax can be treated.

SPS configuration (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]): Both SPS-Config (DL) and ConfiguredGrantConfig (UL) can be treated.

Reconfiguration of slice level PRB quota (TS 28.541 [5])

Configuration of CQI table with certain target block error rate (TS 38.214 [16])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used. For example, SPS can be configured via RIC CONTROL; RIC POLICY can be used, e.g. to set the guidance for the scheduler.

Radio Access Control: Depending on operator's policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and available services, different criterion will be used in determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when congestion occurs in the system, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [2]. For example, access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific cell in order to achieve better QoS for some UEs. A cell-level, UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Four categories of radio access control are indicated as below:

RACH Backoff

RRC Connection Reject

RRC Connection Release

Access Barring

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Connection Mobility Control: For example, a neighbouring cell may be selected for the optimization of QoS of a specific UE. A neighbour handover restriction list may be configured to prevent the UEs from HO to some neighbouring cells in order to guarantee QoS of the UEs served by those neighbouring cells. Or, a capacity boosting mechanism may be used to achieve better QoS, e.g. enable CA/DC.

Handover from the source cell to the target cell

Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list

Enable, disable, or modify CA (TS 38.473 [22], TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])

Enable, disable, or modify dual connectivity (TS 38.473 [22], TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used. For the specific requirements and related stage-3 E2SM works, please refer to the Traffic Steering use case defined in Section 3.1.

3.2.4.2 UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID (as defined in [24])

Slice level: S-NSSAI

DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.

QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).

UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities

RLC/MAC/PHY level: e.g., logical channel, DRX, scheduling request, SPS configurations.

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used for different granularity of controls over E2; an established DRB level information may be needed to change the mapping of QoS flows to a specific DRB or modify DRB attributes; the UE capabilities may be required to make sure if CA/DC can be enabled.

3.2.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the QoS based resource optimization use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g. RB control, handover, access control) by taking into account the runtime status in the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, it is required to specify those measurement parameters as possible as needed over E2 interface.

The following lists the examples of UE-level, cell-level, and slice-level measurement information identified as required:

	UE-level

	Radio channel info available at DU

		CQI (*)

	Radio channel info available at CU-CP for serving cell

	RSRP (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])

Note: include periodical measurement report and/or RRC event trigger measurement report (A1-A6, B1-B2) (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [13]).

	Radio channel info available at CU-CP for neighboring cells

	RSRP (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])

RSRQ (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])

SINR (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12])

Note: include periodical measurement report and/or RRC event trigger measurement report (A1-A6, B1-B2) (TS 38.331 [19], TS 36.331 [12]).

3.3	Use case 3: RAN Slice SLA Assurance

The 3GPP standards architected a sliceable 5G infrastructure which allows creation and management of customized networks to meet specific service requirements that may be demanded by future applications, services and business verticals. Such a flexible architecture needs different requirements to be specified in terms of functionality, performance and group of users which may greatly vary from one service to the other. The 5G standardization efforts have gone into defining specific slices and their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on application/service type [2]. Since network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes the core network, the transport network and the radio access network (RAN), these requirements should be met at any slice subnet during the life-time of a network slice [5], especially in RAN side. Exemplary slice performance requirements are defined in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, latency and reliability at a high level in SDOs such as 3GPP [2] and GSMA [23]. These requirements are defined as a reference for SLA/contractual agreements for each slice, which individually need proper handling in NG-RAN.

Although network slicing support is started to be defined with 3GPP Release 15, slice assurance mechanisms in RAN needs to be further addressed to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN environment. It is necessary to assure the SLAs by dynamically controlling slice configurations based on slice specific performance information. Existing RAN performance measurements [7] and information model definitions [6] are not enough to support RAN slice SLA assurance use cases. This use case is intended to clarify necessary mechanisms and parameters for RAN slice SLA assurance.

3.3.1	Background and goal of the use case

In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific business requirements. These requirements include customizable network capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G standardization efforts, the 5G system should support the needs of the business through the specification of several service needs such as data rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN’s open interfaces and AI/ML based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

3.3.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Non-RT RIC:

Retrieve RAN slice SLA target from respective entities such as SMO, NSSMF

Long term monitoring of RAN slice performance measurements

Training of potential ML models that will be deployed in Non-RT RIC for slow loop optimization and/or Near-RT RIC for fast loop optimization.

Receive slice control/slice SLA assurance rApps from SMO

Create and update A1 policies based on RAN intent and A1 feedback.

Send A1 policies and enrichment information to Near-RT RIC to drive slice assurance

Send O1 reconfiguration requests to SMO for slow-loop slice assurance

Near-RT RIC:

Near real-time monitoring of slice specific RAN performance measurements

Support deployment and execution of the AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC

Receive slice SLA assurance xApps from SMO

Support interpretation and execution of policies from Non-RT RIC

Perform optimized RAN (E2) actions to achieve RAN slice requirements based on O1 configuration, A1 policy, and E2 reports

E2 node:

Support slice assurance actions such as slice-aware resource allocation, prioritization, etc. through E2.

Support slice specific performance measurements through O1

3.3.4	Required data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the Slice SLA Assurance use case. The requirements are specified in Section 4.

3.3.4.1 Control over E2

Radio Resource Allocation, such as configuration of slice level PRB quota. For example, based on prediction, an E2 policy or control to reconfigure slice level PRB may be generated.

Configuration and/or reconfiguration of slice level PRB quota (TS 28.541 [5])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Radio Access Control: Depending on operator's policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, available services and SLA of slice, different criterion will be used in determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when congestion occurs in the system, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [2]. For example, access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific slice in order to achieve better SLA for some slice. A UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Three categories of radio access control are indicated as below:

RRC Connection Reject

RRC Connection Release

Access Barring

3.3.4.2	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID

Slice level: S-NSSAI

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI can be used to derive the resource occupation of each slice.

3.3.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the Slice SLA Assuarance use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g. PRB control, access control) by taking into account the runtime status in the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, it is required to specify those measurement parameters as possible as needed over E2 interface.

The following lists the examples of cell-level measurement information identified as required:

3.4.3.2 Beam-based Mobility Robustness Optimization (bMRO)

Beam-based Mobility Robustness Optimization (bMRO) is an autonomous self-optimizing algorithm that improves beam-based inter-cell mobility performance by applying beam-specific HO parameters including Cell Individual Offsets (CIO), Time to Trigger (TTT), T310 counter, etc. on the handover configuration between neighbor cells, based on the analysis of beam-specific mobility-related counters and/or mobility failure events. bMRO is capable to reduce the number of unnecessary handovers, handover failures as well as ping-pong handovers particularly in cells that cover areas with different mobility characteristics. Performance, complexity and gain analysis has been provided in [27, section 3.3]. Signaling overhead and complexity (RRC re-configuration, mobility reporting and O-CU reconfiguration messages) can be further reduced by beam grouping in which case beams with similar mobility characteristics comprise a beam group (e.g., group 1: low mobility pedestrian area, group 2: high mobility street). Mobility reports consist of aggregated mobility KPI/PMs (e.g., number of too early HOs, number of too late HOs, number of HO to wrong cell) or individual failure reports with root cause (e.g., to early HO, too late HO, HO to wrong cell) or a combination of the two. Reports are sent per each SSB beam or SSB beam group towards each neighbor cell. Individual mobility failure reports will also be reported per UE to allow UE or UE group-based optimization (besides beam or beam group specific reporting). While aggregated mobility KPIs/PMs are used for slow adaptations (e.g., 5 min), individual failure reports are used for faster adaptations (e.g., 100 ms) or for AI/ML based analysis of failure patterns. Measurement reporting periodicity and measurement type are configurable on a per cell basis considering the tradeoff between gain in mobility performance and associated signaling overhead. Mobility KPIs and failure events are forwarded from the O-CU to the Near-RT RIC, and the near-RT RIC configures the CIO and the measurement reporting in the O-CUs. CIOs might be beam- or beam group-based and can also be configurable per UE group (e.g., UE type, UE mobility or UE mode such as energy saving mode).

While AI/ML based approaches are not mandated, AI/ML methods/models can be used i) to build beam groups, to ii) decide on cell individual measurement configuration, to iii) detect changes in mobility characteristics (e.g., traffic jam) that trigger optimization, to iv) group UEs in UE groups as well as v) for the bMRO optimization algorithm itself to calculate the optimal cell individual offsets. In case of dynamic beam pattern optimization, relevant mMIMO beam pattern information must be available at the Near-RT RIC, e.g., mobility reports might indicate a specific beam pattern.
