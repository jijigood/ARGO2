The AALi configuration and management API’s are the API’s that an application (O-DU) executes to configure and manage the AAL-LPU(s) that have been allocated to the application by the O-Cloud. The high-level Configuration and Management Principles are presented in [7].

The below section describes the requirements of the AALi presented to the Application.

AAL Profile Specifications

Profile Specifications Overview

This section contains information for each AAL profile that is supported. A profile can provide several APIs for specific profile configuration that may be required in addition to the general AAL configuration APIs. Profile specific configuration shall be done on a per queue basis and only for functionality that cannot be changed at run time. Each profile shall define a capabilities list that will be used to define the operations supported by the AAL-LPU.

Operation Representation

Operations offloaded to the AAL-LPU are represented by a single operation context that shall include all necessary information required for the AAL operation to be processed on a particular AAL-LPU.

The operation context by itself defines the operation type as supported by the AAL Profile. It includes an operation status, a reference to the operation specific data, which can vary in size and content depending on the operation/profile being provisioned. Application software is responsible for specifying all the operation specific fields in the which are then used by the AAL-LPU to process the requested operation.

Scheduling of AAL operations on application data path is performed using a burst oriented asynchronous API set. A queue on an AAL-LPU accepts a burst of operations (1 to N) using enqueue API. The enqueue API will place the operations to be processed on the AAL-LPU’s hardware input. The dequeue API will retrieve any processed operations available from the queue on the AAL-LPU.

The enqueue API uses an AAL-LPU identifier and a queue identifier to specify the AAL-LPU queue to schedule the processing on. In addition to the operation context a count of the number of operations to process is also required. The enqueue function returns the number of operations it actually enqueued for processing.

The dequeue API uses the same format as the enqueue API but the operation contexts are now used to specify the max processed operations the user wishes to retrieve and the location in which to store them. The API call returns the actual number of processed operations returned.

Profile Capabaillities

Each Profile has a set of capabilities which capture the functions supported by each implementation. This included optional features such a interrupts and debug interfaces. These are used by the application to discover the capabillites of the underlying AAL implementation as per Section 4.2.2.

Memory Management

The AALi implementation shall provide any profile specific memory management (examples allocate and free memory) as required by the AALi implementation.

O-DU AAL PDSCH FEC Profile Specification

As per O-RAN AAL GAnP document [7] the PDSCH FEC Profile supports

CRC Generation

LDPC Encoding

PDSCH Rate Matching

The encode operations are invoked through enqueue and dequeue functions. The operation context defines the parameters used to configure the operation to be accelerated.

AAL FEC PDSCH Profile Capabilities

The AAL FEC PDSCH Profile interface shall work on both a code block (CB) and a transport block (TB) basis.

An operation can be performed on one CB at a time "CB-mode". An operation can be performed on one or multiple CBs that logically belong to a TB "TB-mode".  The input data is the CB or TB input to the encoder. The output data is the ratematched CB or TB data.

The input and output buffers are expected to be allocated by the application with enough room for the output data.

The input buffer is mandatory input and is the incoming code block or transport block data.

The output buffer is mandatory and is the encoded CB(s). In CB-mode it contains the encoded CB of size e (E in 3GPP TS 38.212 section 6.2.5). In TB-mode it contains multiple contiguous encoded CBs of size ea or eb. The output buffer is allocated by the application with enough room for the output data.

The valid modes of operation are:

CB-mode: one CB (attach CRC24B if required)

CB-mode: one CB making up one TB (attach CRC16 or CRC24A if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB of a partial TB (attach CRC24B(s) if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB of a complete TB (attach CRC16, CRC24A and CRC24B(s) if required)

As there are many combinations the AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile shall list the CRC’s supported in its capabilities. The AALi implementation of the AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile shall provide the flexibility to the application to configure the operation in CB-mode with application selected CRC type and TB-mode with application selected CRC type.

As an examble in CB-mode if application can select whether CRC24A is appended to the CB or not. If configured not to append CRC24A then the application is responsible for calculating and appending CRC24A before calling AALi. The input data length is inclusive of CRC24A/B where present and is equal to the code block size K’. Note that code block length will always be a multiple of 8 and it is assumed that there are 8 bits packed into each byte.

As an example, in TB-mode, CRC24A or CRC16 is assumed to be pre-calculated and appended to the inbound TB data buffer, unless the application selects CRC24A is to be appended when it is the responsibility of AALi implementation. The input data length is total size of the CBs inclusive of any CRC24A and CRC24B in the case they were appended by the application.

In TB-mode, a complete TB may be processed in one operation. Alternatively, the TB may be decomposed into several partial TBs (each containing a different subset of the CBs making up the TB), with each partial TB processed in separate operations. The difference between the partial and full-size TB is that AAL AAL-LPU needs the index of the first CB in this group and the number of CBs in the group. The first CB index is given by r but the number of the CBs is calculated by AALi implementation before signalling to the driver. The number of CBs in the partial TB should not be confused with c, the total number of CBs in the full TB (C as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.2.2).

When using TB-mode with CB group based transmission enabled, the HW should not output encoded bits for any CBs in the full or partial TB that are not scheduled for transmission (as detailed in 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.4.2.1).

The number of CBs in the group should not be confused with c, the total number of CBs in the full TB (C as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.2.2).

When using CB-mode code block concatenation is not performed in HW and it is the responsibility of the application to ensure code block concatenation is implemented correctly. Note that code block concatenation can be implemented by virtue of input and output address buffer address management.

The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities shall be reported to the application as per Table 41 AAL-LPU Capabilities. The AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities are defined in Table 51 AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile Capabilities, these capabilities must be reported to the application but may not be implemented by the AALi implementation.

Summary of AAL_PDSCH_FEC Profile capabilities

Here, C is the total number of code blocks in the full TB, as defined in 3GPP TS 38.212. Only used if CB group based transmission capability is supported and enabled.

O-DU AAL PUSCH FEC Profile Specification

This section defines the AAL PUSCH FEC Profile specification. As per O-RAN AAL GAnP document [7] the AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile supports the following functions

PUSCH Rate De-matching

LDPC Decoder

CRC Check

Note the AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile only supports PUSCH Forward Error Correction. It does not include support for PUSCH UCI which can be done in Software.

AAL FEC PUSCH Profile Capabilities

The decode operations are invoked through enqueue and dequeue functions. The operation context defines the parameters used to configure the operation to be accelerated.

The output data buffer is expected to be allocated by the application with enough room for the output data.

The input encoded CB data is mandatory for all AAL PUSCH FEC AAL-LPUs and is the Virtual Circular Buffer data stream with null padding. Each byte in the input circular buffer is the LLR value of each bit of the original CB.

The output hard_output is mandatory and is the decoded CBs of size K’ (CRC24A/B or CRC16 is the last 24bit or 16bits in each decoded CB. The AALi shall give the option to drop the CRC. Where CRC Drop is set then the CRC will not be present at the end of the buffer). In transport block mode the hard_output will contain the decoded transport block.

The AALi shall support the optional soft output buffer which is an LLR rate matched output of size e (this is E as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 6.2.5).

The AALi shall support optional harq input buffer which is a buffer with the input to the HARQ combination function of the AAL-LPU. If the AAL-LPU supports internal memory capability and is enabled, then the HARQ is stored in memory internal to the AAL-LPU and not visible to the application.

The AALi shall support the optional HARQ Combined output which is a buffer for the output of the HARQ combination function of the AAL-LPU. If the AAL-LPU supports internal memory capability and is enabled, then the  HARQ is stored in memory internal to the AAL-LPU and not visible to application.

The buffers are expected to be allocated by the application with enough room for the output data.

As with the AAL PDSCH FEC Profile, the decode interface works on both a code block (CB) and a transport block (TB) basis.

The valid modes of operation are:

CB-mode: one CB (check CRC24B if required)

CB-mode: one CB making up one TB (check CRC16 or CRC24A if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB making up a partial TB (check CRC24B(s) if required)

TB-mode: one or more CB making up a complete TB (check CRC16, CRC24A and CRC24B(s) if required)

The buffer length is inclusive of CRC24A/B where present and is equal the code block size K’.

The first CB Virtual Circular Buffer (VCB) index is given by r but the number of the remaining CB VCBs shall be calculated automatically by the AALi implementation.

The number of remaining CB VCBs should not be confused with c, the total number of CBs in the full TB (C as per 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.2.2)

The length is total size of the CBs inclusive of any CRC24A and CRC24B in case they were appended by the application.

In TB-mode, a complete TB may be processed in one operation. Alternatively, the TB may be decomposed into a number of partial TBs (each containing a different subset of the CBs making up the TB), with each partial TB processed in separate operations.

When using TB-mode with CB group based transmission enabled, the HW should not expect the input of encoded LLRs for any CBs in the full or partial TB that were not scheduled for transmission (as detailed in 3GPP TS 38.212 section 5.4.2.1).

LLR Compression

The AAL PUSCH FEC Profile may support compression of the LLR bits used for the HARQ data. This improves PCIE memory bandwidth and memory storage. The AALi shall report to the application through the capabilities whether LLR compression is supported. Example of compression is when 6bit LLR’s are stored per byte in memory. Compression allows the 6bit LLR’s to be packed in 6bits of memory.

Summary of AAL_PUSCH_FEC Profile capabilities

Table 55 lists the AAL_PUSCH_FEC profile capabilities that should be reported to the application.

Note additional capabilities can also be reported by the AALi implementation.
