Scope

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within O-RAN WG10 and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN.org modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN Alliance with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:

Release x.y.z

where:

x	the first digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e., technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document will have x=01).

y	the second digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.

z	the third digit included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process.

This document is both a Specification and an Informational Report in that it specifies the Information Model and the Data Models that are foundational for O-RAN’s model-driven architecture and for the functions carried out over O-RAN interfaces.

In addition, this document includes information about existing standards and industry work that serve as a basis for work items in O-RAN.  There is a “prosumer” relationship evolving between O-RAN and 3GPP, as each makes its model available and provides model feedback to the other.

Lastly, this document describes the de facto methods and procedures with respect to a “modeling continuum” that aims to establish and evolve an O-RAN Information Model from which O-RAN Data Models may be generated manually or with a set of tools.

References

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

-	References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition number, version number, etc.) or nonspecific.

-	For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

-	For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in Release 16

Definitions and Abbreviations

Definitions

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].

Information Model:  a representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. Typically, an Information Model specifies relations between kinds of things, but may also include relations with individual things. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements or knowledge for the domain context.

Data Model:  an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.  The term data model may refer to two distinct but closely related concepts: (1) an abstract formalization of the objects and relationships found in a particular application domain; (2) the set of concepts used in defining such formalizations - for example concepts such as entities, attributes, relations, or tables.

Logical Data Model: a data model of a specific problem domain expressed independently of a particular database management product or storage technology (physical data model) but in terms of data structures such as relational tables and columns, object-oriented classes, or XML tag

Data Dictionary:  a centralized repository of information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format

Component Physical Data Models:  a representation of a data design as implemented, or intended to be implemented, in a database management system for each component.  In the lifecycle of a project, it typically derives from a logical data model and will include the database artifacts required to create relationships between tables or to achieve performance goals, such as indexes, constraint definitions, linking tables, partitioned tables or clusters

Abbreviations and acronyms

Overview and Philosophy

“Prosumer” relationship between O-RAN and Standards Development Organizations

The O-RAN Alliance complements the work of other Standards Development Organizations (SDO):  3GPP, IETF, and IANA are among the primary sources for Management specifications for O-RAN components.

3GPP has published:

its Generic Network Resource Model (NRM), including:

a Stage 2 NRM Information Model, in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14];

corresponding Stage 3 Solution Sets, one of which consists of YANG Data Models, in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15];

its 5G Network Resource Model (NRM), including the Stage 2 NR NRM Information Model and corresponding Stage 3 Solution Sets, one of which consists of YANG Data Models, in 3GPP TS 28.541 [8];

“Management and Orchestration APIs”, including YANG data models from both NRMs, in a publicly available git repository

O-RAN Information Model, Data Models, and modeling processes should complement the work of other SDOs, not conflict or compete.

When 3GPP makes updates to their specification, they are incorporated into the O-RAN OAM Interface Specification [39].  This, in turn, drives the updates that are to be made to both the Information Model and Data Models within O-RAN.

Information and Data Models as a Modeling Continuum

Within O-RAN, the de facto methods and procedures with respect to the early stage of an O-RAN “modeling continuum” aim to evolve one common and coherent Information Model for providing O-RAN extensions to the existing 4G/5G IMs such as the 3GPP NRMs, from which O-RAN Data Models may be generated.

Figure 2.2-1 Information and Data Models as a Modeling Continuum (conceptual)

Information and Data Modeling Co-Evolution

The “Modeling Continuum” depicted as Figure 2.2-1 is purely conceptual and is intended to provide a framework for Information and Data Modeling Co-evolution.

Here is an example of the process to be adapted to, and adopted by, O-RAN:

Figure 2.3-1 Information and Data Modeling Co-Evolution [34]

Model and Use Case Development (process)

There is evolvoing process within O-RAN to guide and inform Information Model and Data Model(s) development based on prioritized use cases.

Here is example of the process to be adapted to, and adopted by, O-RAN.

Figure 2.4-1  Model and Use Case Development (process) [34]

O-RAN components reflected within O-RAN Information Model and Data Model(s)

The work to evolve the following O-RAN components will both follow and provide feedback on the OAM Information Model and Data Models of 3GPP:

Near-RT-RIC

O-CU-UP

O-CU-CP

O-DU

O-RU

O-eNB

The O-RAN entities listed below are also expected to be reflected within the O-RAN Information Model:

Non-RT-RIC: ManagedApplication (rApp), A1-Policies

Near-RT-RIC; ManagedApplication (xApp), A1 interfaces, A1 Policies, A1-Topology

E2 interfaces and E2-Topology

O2 interfaces and O2-Topology [O-Cloud is a future consideration from a modelling perspective]

Modeling approach, Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Modeling is the designing of software applications before coding. Modeling is an essential part of software projects.

Models raise the level of abstraction by hiding or masking details, bringing out the “big picture,” or by focusing on different aspects of a prototype.

The Information Model within O-RAN uses the Unified Modeling Language™ (UML®) version 2.5.1 [46] from the Object Management Group (OMG).

O-RAN Information Model follows methodology documented 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] Clause 5.2.

Class definitions

ManagedApplication <<IOC>>

Definition

This Information Object Class (IOC) is provided for sub-classing only. It provides attribute(s) that are common to application IOCs.

This IOC represents a deployed instance of software application that may be independently tested and separately deployed from the hosting entity (e.g. NearRTRICFunction). The hosting NearRTRICFunction can mediate the management services for the ManagedApplication. A NearRTRICFunction can host zero or more ManagedApplication.

Attributes

The ManagedApplication IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14], clause 4.3.29), attributes operationalState, usageState, administrativeState imported from StateManagementEntity Archetype (defined in 3GPP TS 28.625 [73], clause 4.3.1) and the following attributes:

PerformanceMeasureDictionary

Definition

Resource Types in the O-Cloud provide the SMO a dictionary of performance measures available by Resources of the Resource Type. The O-Cloud Deployment Management Services also report performance of workloads deployed into the cloud. The DMS Performance follows ETSI-NFV specification IFA027 [76]. The performance dictionary should be structured to allow resource vendors to specify their unique performance measures while also supporting performance measures which are defined by a standard.

Attributes

The PerformanceMeasureDictionary includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14], clause 4.3.29)and the following attributes:

AlarmDictionary

Definition

There is more information about an alarm than is included in a notification about an alarm occurrence. The Alarm Dictionary provides that data to the SMO such that the extended data may be used to assist in alarm event processing. These could include repair actions which guide a user of the SMO of what to do when the alarm occurs. If the alarm is based on a standard, this could also include the standard-defined descriptions/discussion about the alarm condition.

Along with Network Functions, O-Cloud resources or deployments can generate an alarm notification which are sent to subscribed consumers. It is expected that the SMO is the primary consumer of these events which may need the ability to correlate them when there is a single root cause for alarms from multiple sources. The dictionary definition provides extensibility where such end-to-end type of signatures may be described.

Not all alarms definitions are standardized and therefore the alarm dictionary should be structured to allow a resource and/or application vendors to specify their unique alarms while also supporting alarms which are defined by a standard.

ProbableCause <<dataType>>

Definition

The Probable Cause is intended to provide an indication of what the root cause of the event could be. This intends to help operators to focus on where to look for to determine the true root cause. There are industry suggested lists of probable causes that could be used. When used the probable cause definition should allow for an indication of such a source.

Alarm Definitions may provide one or more probable causes as part of their extended fields. However, each alarm event is expected to have a probable cause that is specific to the instance. To facilitate the aspect of the alarm event the probable causes used by the product vendor for alarm events are listed independently in the alarm dictionary.

The Probable Cause is a structured data type consisting of the following attributes:

Table 1  Classes/components and interfaces that comprise the O-RAN Information Model and Data Model(s)

Void

O-RAN Data Models

For O1 interfaces, the O-RAN Information Model development should precede and serve as the basis for the Data Model development within each working group (WG1 through WG10).

Void

Formal relationship (traceability) between O-RAN Data Models and the O-RAN Information Model

At present, there is no formal relationship and/or traceability between the O-RAN Data Models and O-RAN Information Model; however, this is expected to evolve over time.

As indicated within Clause 2 “Overview and Philosophy,” there is a modeling continuum that aims to establish and evolve one common and coherent Information Model for 5G/LTE RAN from which Data Models may be generated.

As the modeling practices and processes within O-RAN mature, the Information Model and Data Models are expected to co-evolve to develop the APIs required by specific use cases, as depicted below.

Figure 4.2-1 Information and Data Modeling Co-Evolution [34]

Usage of 3GPP Data Models

The O-RAN Alliance complements the work of other SDOs.  3GPP is the primary source for management plane specifications for O-RAN components.

Please refer to Annex C for the 3GPP-source Data Models that are approved for use.

The following table (snapshot) shows a subset of the mapping as defined by the O-RAN OAM Architecture, version 8.00 [25], of 3GPP yang data models to O-RAN model construct.

Table 3  Non 3GPP yang models

YANG Conventions

This clause describes the recommended conventions to be used in the O-RAN Alliance when writing YANG models.

In particular, because the creation and maintenance of YANG models is expected to be distributed across different working groups, this guide is intended to ensure that the way the models are organized and presented will be consistent across the entirety of the O-RAN Alliance.

Naming

MODULE FILE NAMING: All YANG modules should have filenames of the form “o-ran-xxx.yang”. Additionally, to avoid collisions in the naming of YANG modules in O-RAN, in cases where a YANG module is dedicated to one O-RAN entity, such name should contain name of this O-RAN entity, i.e. o-ran-odu-<unique-name>.yang, o-ran-ocu-<unique-name>.yang. For O-RAN common YANG modules name shall follow the form of “o-ran-common-<unique-name>.yang”.

MODULE NAMESPACE: YANG modules should have a namespace defined of the form namespace "urn:o-ran:<unique-name>:version"; where version represents an increasing numerical integer value and where the value used in all newly defined models is "1". The module namespace version shall be incremented when any non-backwards compatible changes are introduced into a model. Namespaces, as well as module file name, shall contain name of the O-RAN entity or “common” for common YANG modules, i.e. “urn:o-ran-odu:<unique-name>:version”, “urn:o-ran-common:<unique-name>:version”.

PREFIX NAMING: Each module shall have a prefix statement with a prefix that other dependent modules will use (also used in path references within the same module). Prefixes should be short and clear, with abbreviations as appropriate. Module prefixes should be of the form: o-ran-<unique-name>, or or-<unique-name>, and shall be unique regardless of over which interface the YANG module is exposed (ex. O1 or Open FrontHaul M-Plane).

Revision Statement

The revision statement in all YANG models should include a reference statement used to cross-reference to the version of a particular O-RAN publication where the corresponding functionality was initially introduced. The revision statement of the YANG models also should include a description that is used to track the versioning of the YANG model. All revision statement descriptions shall begin with version a.b.c, where a, b and c are used to reflect the version of the YANG model, where:

‘a’ corresponds to the first digit of the O-RAN specification version where the corresponding description was first introduced;

‘b’ is incremented when errors in the YANG model have been corrected;

‘c’ is incremented only in working versions of the YANG model indicating incremental changes during the editing process. Hence, all published versions of O-RAN alliance YANG models should have this value set to zero.

Indents

O-RAN Alliance YANG models should use two-space tab indents.

YANG Language Usage

YANG VERSION: All models shall use YANG data modeling language version 1.1 (RFC 7950 [27]) and follow the Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of Documents Containing YANG Data Models [RFC 8407 [64]].

TOP-LEVEL DATA NODE: There should only be one top-level data node defined in each YANG module, if any data nodes are defined at all.

NMDA (Network Management Datastore Architecture): No O-RAN YANG models should prevent the use of NMDA [RFC 8342 [60]].

KEY-LESS LISTS OF OPERATIONAL STATE: Although permitted in YANG, the use of a list that consists of operational-state without a defined key should be avoided.

VALIDATION: All YANG modules should be validated / compiled with pyang tool using the following flag: pyang --lint <module>. Note, successful compilation with pyang does not guarantee a working model, as xPATH expressions aren't evaluated and forbidden operational data dependencies in the configuration may not generate appropriate errors.

CONSTRAINTS: Generally, O-RAN systems should strive to consider a blank configuration to be a valid config.

Cross Working Group Co-ordination

Models that are likely to be applicable to more than one O-RAN Alliance working group should provide clear delineation between separate working groups configuration and/or state. The use of feature and if-feature is recommended to ensure that NETCONF servers are not required to implement the entire data model, e.g., when aspects of such relate to the individual working group defined use cases. The feature name should indicate which working group or which O-RAN entity the capabilities have been defined by.

Development of YANG Data Models compatible with O1

All YANGs created by O-RAN which intend to be used as O1 aligned YANG Data Models shall follow rules for:

·         InformationObjectClass - abstract, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.2.2

·         Naming attribute, usually named ‘id’, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.3.2

·         InformationObjectClass, definition in YANG, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.4.1

·         Generalization Relationship – inheritance from a class, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.5.2

·         Name containment – composite aggregation association relationship, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.6.2

·         Recursive containment, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.7

·         Multi-root management tree, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.8

·         Alternative containment, please refer to 3GPP TS 32.160 [29] clause 6.2.9

When O-RAN defines IoCs then those shall be correlated to O-RAN documents produced by the WG which defines O1 aligned YANG Data Model.

When there are inconsistencies between definition in any of TS 32.156 [28], TS 32.160 [29] and definition in this document, definition in this document take precedence.

Augmentations of 3GPP YANG Data Models

All augmentations of 3GPP YANG Data Models, to be compliant, shall not violate rules mentioned in “Development of YANG Data Models compatible with O1” clause of this document.

Augmentations shall be made in separate O-RAN originated YANG Data Model file, as modification of original 3GPP YANG Data Model file is prohibited.
