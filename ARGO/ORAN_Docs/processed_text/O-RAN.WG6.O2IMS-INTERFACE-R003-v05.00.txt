OCloud
The OCloud service object represents an instance of an O-Cloud. For more information about O-Cloud, refer to clause 3.1 in the "O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles Specification" [24].
The information representing the OCloud shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.1.2-1.
Table 2.1.1.1.2-1: Attributes of the OCloud
ResourceType
The ResourceType service object represents a resource type in an O-Cloud.
Resource types provide the categorization of O-Cloud Nodes as described in the O-RAN Cloud Architecture and Deployment Scenarios [7] specification. The values for these types are used to build the inventory and enable an authorized consumer to track resource changes over time. The O-Cloud provides a mechanism to discover the resource types with respective operations on resource types.
Please note that the list of resource classes is not exhaustive, and additional classes are FFS.
The information representing the ResourceType shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.1.3-1.
Table 2.1.1.1.3-1: Attributes of the ResourceType
ResourcePool
The ResourcePool service object respresents a resource pool instance in an O-Cloud.
The O-Cloud is a distributed cloud with resources placed in different locations. Those resources are organized into resource pools. There can be more than one resource pool for a given O-Cloud at the same physical location. However, each resource pool requires a different identity since the SMO will direct a deployment based on homing policies to a specific location. This is different than typical cloud deployments as location is key to meeting latency requirements, sometime to elements outside of the O-Cloud.
NOTE:	The identity of a resource pool cannot be tied to a specific resource within the pool as that resource may be replaced as part of the O-Cloud lifecycle.
The information representing the ResourcePool shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.1.4-1.
Table 2.1.1.1.4-1: Attributes of the ResourcePool
Resource
The Resource service object represents an instance of a resource in the O-Cloud.
Resource pools are comprised of resources, wherein a specific instance of a resource can only be part of a single resource pool.
Resources are of a specific resource type. The resource type of a given resource instance does not change over the lifetime of such a resource instance.
The information representing an individual Resource shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.1.5-1.
Table 2.1.1.1.5-1: Attributes of the Resource
DeploymentManager
The DeploymentManager service object represents an instance of a DMS in the O-Cloud. This service object allows a client to discover the details about a DMS instance. This service object provides a list of supported capabilities, and metrics for total capacity, current allocations, current reservations. For more information about DMS, refer to clause 1.3.1 in the "O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles Specification" [24].
The available capacity information supported by a DeploymentManager shall be calculated as Capacity - Allocated - Reserved.
The information representing an instance of a DeploymentManager shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.1.6-1.
Table 2.1.1.1.6-1: Attributes of the DeploymentManager
Subscription
The Subscription service object represents an instance of a subscription to infrastructure inventory notifications for when resources within the inventory change.
Subscriptions are required for a notification to be generated. Information about the change are provided to the consumer when the consumers specified criteria is met. The absence of a filter means all events are sent.
The information representing one subscription shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.1.7-1.
Table 2.1.1.1.7-1: Attributes of the Subscription
InfrastructureInventoryObject
The InfrastructureInventoryObject is an abstract class which shall be implemented by one of its specific sub-classes. The InfrastructureInventoryObject does not have any common attributes.
Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Service Objects
General
The O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycleManagement services has operations on the following managed service objects that are of interest to the SMO:
-	OCloud,
-	DeploymentManager,
-	Location,
-	Asset,
Figure 2.1.1.2.1-1 illustrates the relationships in between the managed service objects of the SMO Inventory and the O2ims_InfrastructureInventory service objects as a result of LifeCycle operations.

Figure 2.1.1.2.1-1 SMO to OCloud Inventory Relationships
OCloud
The OCloud service object represents an instance of an O-Cloud within the SMO. For more information about O-Cloud, refer to clause 3.1 in the "O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles Specification" [24].
The SMO has a view of the O-Cloud and initiates its deployment. From the O2 General Aspects and Principles [24] the SMO generates an ID and inventory record for the O-Cloud. Once the O-Cloud has reached a level of completeness, when it is ready to be provisioned for used to deploy workloads, the O-Cloud invokes a callback identified at the onset of the lifecycle process passing enough information for the SMO to associate the assigned globalCloudID, with the internal oCloudID and store its Infrastructure Management Service end point. The relationship to the globalCloudID and oCloudID is one-to-one in that there is a single, unique globalCloudID for each O-Cloud. The O-Cloud generates its own ID for its internal data relationships. Thus, reducing the coupling of the O-Cloud and the SMO which could be from different vendors. There is no guarantee that two different O-Clouds will not have the same internal oCloudID and therefore it is the responsibility of the SMO to discern and federate the two with different globalCloudID values.
The information representing the OCloud shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.2.2-1.
Table 2.1.1.2.2-1: Attributes of the OCloud
DeploymentManager
The DeploymentManager service object represents an instance of a DMS in an O-Cloud that has been registered and discovered from the O-Cloud Infrastructure Inventory. This service object allows SMO clients to discover the details about a DMS instance. This service object provides a list of supported capabilities, and metrics for total capacity, current allocations, current reservations. For more information about DMS, refer to clause 1.3.1 in the "O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles Specification" [24].
The total capacity of a DeploymentManager and its capabilities is determined by the resources that though provisioning has been made available to the DeploymentManager. The DeploymentManager updates its inventory record when new resources have been assigned or removed which affect its total capacity. It also periodically updates it inventory record based on workload deployments which affect both its allocations and potentially reservations. From these values the SMO can calculate the available capacity of the Deployment Manager by subtracting Allocations and Reservations from its total Capacity (AvailableCapacity = TotalCapacity - Allocations - Reservations).
The information representing an instance of a DeploymentManager shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.2.3-1.
Table 2.1.1.2.3-1: Attributes of the DeploymentManager
Location
The Location service object represents a location where assets can be deployed. This could be an central, regional, or edge location.
The information representing an instance of a Location shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.2.4-1.
Table 2.1.1.2.4-1: Attributes of the Location
Asset
The Asset service object represents an asset purchased or leased with a right-to-use by the operator and thus requires Asset Tracking.
The information representing an instance of an Asset should follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.2.5-1.
Table 2.1.1.2.5-1: Attributes of an Asset

Figure 2.2.1.3.1-3 Infrastructure Fault Relationships of the O2ims_InfrastructureMonitoring Services
AlarmEventRecord
The AlarmEventRecord service object represents a stored instance detected within the O-Cloud Resources and stored by the IMS.
The AlarmEventRecord can represent either a current active alarm or one that occurred in the past. Retention of an AlarmEventRecord is dependent on IMS configuration which would be set through an IMS Provisioning service.
The information representing an individual AlarmEventRecord follows the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.3.2-1.
Table 2.1.1.3.2-1: Attributes of the AlarmEventRecord
ProbableCauses
ProbableCauses provides further qualification as to the root cause of an alarm. Probable causes are more of a description and therefore somewhat verbose. They are represented by an assigned ID which when needed the textual attributes can be looked up. Many ProbableCauses are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.733 [27] and ITU-T Rec X.736 [28]. The probable cause gives an indication of a possible root cause(s) that might have triggered the alarm on the resource based on detectable signatures with the O-Cloud. Additional ProbableCauses can be added by the O-Cloud provider. Work to standardize the probable causes for O-Cloud is for FFS.
The information representing one probableCause follows the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.3.3-1.
Table 2.1.1.3.3-1: Attributes of the ProbableCause
Subscription
The Subscription service object represents an instance of a subscription to infrastructure fault notifications for when qualifying alarm list entry changes occur.
Subscriptions are required for a notification to be generated. A consumer, such as the SMO, establishes a valid subscription to alarms. Information about the alarm is provided to the consumer when the consumers specified criteria is met. The absence of a filter means all events are sent.
The information representing one subscription follows the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.3.4-1.
Table 2.1.1.3.4-1: Attributes of the Subscription

The O2ims_InfrastructureMonitoring services provide these. For this release on fault is defined. Performance and Heartbeat is FFS.
Alarm Services
It is important to understand the differences between faults and alarms. All faults are logged, only some faults may be worthy of being an alarm. Policies within the IMS determine if a fault or set of faults warrant an alarm to be created. All Alarms are also logged. The services for accessing log files containing all fault data is FFS. The following services are associated with alarms.
Service description
The O-Cloud has a historical table of past and active alarms. The SMO or any other consumer with permissions can query this table for trending analysis, correlation, or synchronization. Additionally, the service provides the ability to subscribe to alarm events which are evaluated whenever a change occurs to an AlarmEventRecord.
For a complete list of requirements see the O-Cloud Alarm related use cases in [23].

To see a complete description of the Alarm List Configure operation, refer to O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [23], clause 3.7.11.
The IMS keeps all the current alarms in an Alarm List. The Retention Period of alarms can be changed by the Alarm List Configure operation. After the Retention Period expires, alarms in the Alarm List will be purged or archived based on alarm policy. For example, the Alarm List Configure request could have an attribute to specify to Retention Period by the IMS of Compute Node alarms (resource types) for 72 hours. When the current value of the retentionPeriod is reduced then the Alarm Purge Use Case is triggered, found in O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [23], clause 3.7.13.
Another Alarm List Configure operation could adjust the value(s) in the Extension attribute list of the Alarm List. Additional extensions attributes in the Alarm List Management request could change other aspects of Alarm List Management behavior. This would allow for implementation specific behavior. For example, an extension attribute might cause alarms purged or archived based on triggers. Extensions might define overflow behavior, or Alarm List composition handling.
Table 2.1.3.1.2.6-1 lists the information flow exchanged between the SMO and the O-Cloud in a request/response pattern over O2 IMS.

Service description
The O2ims_InfrastructureSoftware Management services support procedures that enable SMO/FOCOM to initiate the software update process for the O-Cloud Infrastructure Management software, the Deployment Management software, Server OS Software, updates, and patches, and firmware updates for accelerators. For initial release the O-Cloud software can be manually updated. Therefore, the orchestrated Software Update procedure is deferred FFS.
O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycleManagement Services
Service description
Although O-Clouds are usually built for future capacity, they are not static. Physical resources can become defective or obsolete. Also, the O-Cloud may grow beyond its initial deployed capacity. These activities represent life cycle events to the O-Cloud. Automation is expected to offload manual processes due to the high numbers expected of O-Cloud instances. O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycleManagement Services support procedures for the automation of O-Clouds lifecycle events.
Service operations
Primary Use cases for O-Cloud Genesis and O-Cloud Scaling are FFS. However, for this release the Notification to a callback specified at the onset of O-Cloud Genesis is defined.
O-Cloud Available Event Notification
The O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycle service shall provide a consumer who was established at the onset of O-Cloud Genesis. Data expected to be included with the callback URI in the genesis data is the globalCloudID, each globalLocationID, and each AssetID for infrastructure at those locations. Once enough of the O-Cloud is discovered, provisioned and is available for additional provisioning or workload deployments, the O-Cloud shall send the O-CloudAvailableEvent to the consumer (SMO), thus registering its InfrastructureManagementServiceEndPoint with the SMO. After receiving the notification, the SMO will interogate the InfrastructureInventory APIs to account for corporate assets and discover the DMS service endpoints to allow workloads to be deployed.
NOTE:	It is up to the protocol and data model specification to determine the one or various protocol operations enabling the notification service to invoke the specified callback procedure.

-	The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [11].
-	The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. The {apiName} of each interface is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding O2ims RESTful API.
-	The <apiMajorVersion> indicates the current major version of the API and is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding O2ims RESTful API.
-	The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> indicates a resource URI of the API, and shall be set as described in in the corresponding O2ims RESTful API for each one of the defined resources.
Either HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [19], or HTTP/1.1, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [30] shall be used.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as specified in IETF RFC 793 [31] shall be used as transport protocol for HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1.
For HTTP requests and responses that have a body, the content format JSON (see IETF RFC 8259 [20]) shall be supported. The JSON format shall be signalled by the content type "application/json".
All APIs shall support and use HTTP over TLS (also known as HTTPS) (see IETF RFC 2818 [32]). At least support TLS version 1.2 but recommended to support TLS version 1.3 as defined by IETF RFC 5246 [33] shall be supported.
NOTE 1:	The HTTP protocol elements mentioned in the O2ims RESTful APIs originate from the HTTP specification; HTTPS runs the HTTP protocol on top of a TLS layer. For simplicity, the O2ims RESTful APIs specifications therefore use the statement above to mention "HTTP request", "HTTP header", etc., without explicitly calling out HTTPS.
NOTE 2:	There are a number of best practices and guidelines how to configure and implement TLS 1.2 in a secure manner, as security threats evolve. A detailed specification of those is beyond the scope of the present document; the reader is referred to external documentation such as annex E of ETSI TS 133 310 [35].
All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [34]. An implementation that dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of path segments that are separated by "/", query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the character set that is allowed by IETF RFC 3986 [34] for these parts.
NOTE 3:	This means that characters not part of this allowed set are escaped using percent-encoding as defined by IETF RFC 3986 [34].
Unless otherwise specified explicitly, all request URI parameters that are part of the path of the resource URI shall be individual path segments, i.e., shall not contain the "/" character.
NOTE 4:	A request URI parameter is denoted by a string in curly brackets, e.g. {fooId}.
Usage of HTTP header fields
General
HTTP headers are components of the header section of the HTTP request and response messages. They contain the information about the server/client and metadata of the transaction. The use of HTTP header fields shall comply with the provisions defined for those header fields in the specifications referenced from tables 3.1.3.2-1 and 3.1.3.3-1. The following clauses describe more details related to selected HTTP header fields.
Request header fields
This clause describes the usage of selected HTTP header fields of the request messages in the O2ims RESTful APIs. The HTTP header fields used in the request messages that shall be supported are specified in table 3.1.3.2-1.
Table 3.1.3.2-1: Header fields supported in the request message
Response header fields
This clause describes the usage of selected HTTP header fields of the response messages in the O2ims RESTful APIs. The HTTP header fields used in the response messages are specified in table 3.1.3.3-1.
Table 3.1.3.3-1: Header fields supported in the response message
Result set control
Introduction
This clause specifies procedures that allow to control the size of the result set of GET requests w.r.t. the number of entries in a response list (using attribute-based filtering) or w.r.t. the number of attributes returned in a response (using attribute selection).
Attribute-based filtering and selector
The use of attribute-based filtering shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
Handling of large query results
The handling of large query results shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].
Error reporting
In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is generally not enough to discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error information is typically delivered.
The error reporting shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 6 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
Common data types
Structured data types
Introduction
This clause defines data structures that are referenced from data structures in multiple O2ims RESTful APIs.
Type: Object
An object contains structured data and shall comply with the provisions of clause 4 of IETF RFC 8259 [ref-rfc8259].
Type: Link
This type represents a link to a resource using an absolute URI. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 7.1.3-1.
Table 3.1.6.1.3-1: Definition of the Link data type
Type: NotificationLink
This type represents a link to a resource in a notification, using an absolute or relative URI. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 3.1.6.1.4-1.
Table 3.1.6.1.4-1: Definition of the NotificationLink data type
Type: KeyValuePairs
This type represents a list of key-value pairs. The order of the pairs in the list is not significant. In JSON, a set of key-value pairs is represented as an object. It shall comply with the provisions defined in clause 4 of IETF RFC 8259 [ref-rfc8259]. In the following example, a list of key-value pairs with four keys ("aString", "aNumber", "anArray" and "anObject") is provided to illustrate that the values associated with different keys can be of different type.
EXAMPLE:
{
"aString" : "O2ims service",
"aNumber" : 0.03,
"anArray" : [1,2,3],
"anObject" : {"organization" : "O-RAN", workingGroup" : "WG6"}
}
Type: ApiVersionInformation
This type represents API version information. It shall comply with the provisions defined in table 3.1.6.1.6-1.
Table 3.1.6.1.6-1: ApiVersionInformation data type
Simple data types and enumerations
Introduction
This clause defines simple data types and enumerations that can be referenced from data structures defined in multiple interfaces.
Simple data types
Table 3.1.6.2.2-1 lists the simple data types that are referenced from multiple interfaces.
Table 3.1.6.2.2-1: Simple data types
Authorization of API requests and notifications
Introduction
The present version of this document does not specify specific authorization mechanisms to be considered for handling API requests and notifications specified in the present document. It is expected that implementations will leverage best practices and guidelines from relevant standards such as those defined in:
-	IETF RFC 5246 [ref-rfc5246] for the use of TLS 1.2/1.3,
-	IETF RFC 7235 [ref-rfc7235] for authentication mechanisms over HTTP/1.1,
-	IETF RFC 6749 [ref-rfc6749] for the use of OAuth 2.0 authorization framework,
-	IETF RFC 6750 [ref-rfc6750] for the use of OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, and
-	IETF RFC 7519 [ref-rfc7519] for use of JSON web tokens.
Version management
Version identifiers and parameters
API version identifiers and rules for incrementing version identifier fields shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 9.1 and 9.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification and OpenAPI specification that ETSI publishes; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" and OpenAPI that O-RAN publishes is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
Clause 9.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] provides examples of backward and non-backward compatible changes.
Version information retrieval and signaling
The API producer shall support the dedicated URIs to enable API consumers to retrieve information about API versions supported by an API producer as specified in clause 9.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22], and the API consumer shall include the "Version" HTTP header in each HTTP request as specified in clause 9.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API
Description
This API allows the SMO to invoke O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Services towards the O-Cloud.
The operations defined for O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Services through this API are:
Query information about one or multiple Resource Type
Query information about one or multiple Resource Pool
Query information about one or multiple Resource
Query information about one or multiple Deployment Manager
Query information about one or multiple Subscriptions
Notify consumer identified by an established subscription which is not filtered by the filter criteria of the occurrence of a change to the infrastructure inventory objects
API version
For the O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API version as specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be 1, the MINOR version field shall be 0, and the PATCH version field shall be 0.
REST resources structure and methods
All resource URIs of the API shall use the base URI specification defined in clause 3.1.2. The string "O2ims_infrastructureInventory" shall be used to represent {apiName}. All resource URIs in the clauses below are defined relative to the formed base URI (i.e., {apiRoot}/O2ims_infrastructureInventory/{apiVersion}).
When ambiguity is possible, the term REST resource is used to make the distinction between the term resource as understood within the context of REST API from the term resource as understood within the context of O-RAN.
Figure 3.2.3-1 shows the overall resource URI structure defined for the O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API.
Figure 3.2.3-1 Resource URI structure of the O2ims-infrastructureInventory API
Table 3.2.3-1provides an overview of the resources and applicable HTTP methods.
The O-Cloud shall support responding to requests for all HTTP methods on the resources in table 3.2.3-1 that are marked as "M" (mandatory) in the "Cat" column. The O-Cloud shall also support the "API versions" resources as specified in clause 3.1.8.
