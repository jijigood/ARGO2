Introduction
The increasing sophistication of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of classical asymmetric cryptographic algorithms currently used in O-RAN networks. As quantum computers become more powerful, they will be capable of breaking asymmetric classical encryption algorithms, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of sensitive information exchanged between network entities. This vulnerability has far-reaching implications for the security and trustworthiness of O-RAN networks, which are designed to provide secure and reliable communication services for critical infrastructure and applications.
The migration to Quantum Safe Cryptography (QSC) is essential to ensure the long-term security and resilience of O-RAN networks against potential quantum computer-based attacks. QSC refers to cryptographic techniques and algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers. By migrating to QSC, O-RAN networks can maintain their security posture and prevent potential disruptions to services and operations.
This technical report contains a cryptographic inventory, covering all cryptographic algorithms employed in O-RAN specification at this time.
Scope
The present document presents the Post-Quantum Cryptography study as it applies to O-RAN architectural elements.

Post-Quantum Cryptography background
NIST has initiated the process of the Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization in 2017 [i.2]. On 5th Jul 2022, they announced the standard candidates for public-key encryption:
CRYSTALS-Kyber,
for digital signature: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON and SPHINCS+.
On 13th Aug 2024, NIST published FIPS 203 [i.3], FIPS 204 [i.4] and FIPS 205 [i.5], specifying algorithms derived from CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-KYBER and SPHINCS+: ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA. A future FIPS 206 is planned to specify FN-DSA, based on FALCON.
Further input from NIST:
“Quantum computers would completely break many public-key cryptosystems, including RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve cryptosystems. These cryptosystems are used to implement digital signatures and key establishment and play a crucial role in ensuring the confidentiality and authenticity of communications on the Internet and other networks.” [i.2]
Further input from NCSC:
“In contrast with PKC, the security of symmetric cryptography is not significantly impacted by quantum computers, and existing symmetric algorithms with at least 128-bit keys (such as AES) can continue to be used. The security of hash functions such as SHA-256 is also not significantly affected, and secure hash functions can also continue to be used.” [i.6]
The ETSI QSC group has developed a document outlining a Quantum Safe Cryptography migration strategy and recommendations for transitioning to quantum-safe schemes [i.7]. A key component of this strategy is the creation of a cryptographic inventory or cryptographic bill of material (CBOM) to support the development of a preparation and PQC migration plan, as well as the execution of the migration.
According to the LS [i.8], the ETSI QSC is seeking additional information, such as a "detailed list of cryptographic algorithms and/or protocol implementations." This list may include "guidance on algorithm exposure, effective key lengths, potential for hybrid deployment, and potential for crypto agility."
In a related development, as noted in another LS [i.9], the GSMA has produced a Guidelines for Telecom Use Cases document [i.10], which includes the development of a ""comprehensive cryptographic inventory"" to some extent.
