ResourcePool

The ResourcePool service object respresents a resource pool instance in an O-Cloud.

The O-Cloud is a distributed cloud with resources placed in different locations. Those resources are organized into resource pools. There can be more than one resource pool for a given O-Cloud at the same physical location. However, each resource pool requires a different identity since the SMO will direct a deployment based on homing policies to a specific location. This is different than typical cloud deployments as location is key to meeting latency requirements, sometime to elements outside of the O-Cloud.

NOTE:	The identity of a resource pool cannot be tied to a specific resource within the pool as that resource may be replaced as part of the O-Cloud lifecycle.

Figure 2.1.1.2.1-1 SMO to OCloud Inventory Relationships

OCloud

The OCloud service object represents an instance of an O-Cloud within the SMO. For more information about O-Cloud, refer to clause 3.1 in the "O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles Specification" [24].

The SMO has a view of the O-Cloud and initiates its deployment. From the O2 General Aspects and Principles [24] the SMO generates an ID and inventory record for the O-Cloud. Once the O-Cloud has reached a level of completeness, when it is ready to be provisioned for used to deploy workloads, the O-Cloud invokes a callback identified at the onset of the lifecycle process passing enough information for the SMO to associate the assigned globalCloudID, with the internal oCloudID and store its Infrastructure Management Service end point. The relationship to the globalCloudID and oCloudID is one-to-one in that there is a single, unique globalCloudID for each O-Cloud. The O-Cloud generates its own ID for its internal data relationships. Thus, reducing the coupling of the O-Cloud and the SMO which could be from different vendors. There is no guarantee that two different O-Clouds will not have the same internal oCloudID and therefore it is the responsibility of the SMO to discern and federate the two with different globalCloudID values.

The information representing the OCloud shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.2.2-1.

Table 2.1.1.2.2-1: Attributes of the OCloud

Attribute

Qualifier

Description

oCloudId

M

Identifier of the O-Cloud instance. Unique within an O-Cloud instance.

globalCloudId

M

Identifier of the O-Cloud instance. Globally unique across O-Cloud instances. This value was provided by the SMO with the callback URI at the beginning of O-Cloud genesis and used in registration at the end of genesis.

infrastructureMangementServiceEndPoint

M

The URI root to all services provided by the O2ims interface, Inventory only being one of them.

DeploymentManager

The DeploymentManager service object represents an instance of a DMS in an O-Cloud that has been registered and discovered from the O-Cloud Infrastructure Inventory. This service object allows SMO clients to discover the details about a DMS instance. This service object provides a list of supported capabilities, and metrics for total capacity, current allocations, current reservations. For more information about DMS, refer to clause 1.3.1 in the "O-RAN O2 General Aspects and Principles Specification" [24].

The total capacity of a DeploymentManager and its capabilities is determined by the resources that though provisioning has been made available to the DeploymentManager. The DeploymentManager updates its inventory record when new resources have been assigned or removed which affect its total capacity. It also periodically updates it inventory record based on workload deployments which affect both its allocations and potentially reservations. From these values the SMO can calculate the available capacity of the Deployment Manager by subtracting Allocations and Reservations from its total Capacity (AvailableCapacity = TotalCapacity - Allocations - Reservations).

The information representing an instance of a DeploymentManager shall follow the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.2.3-1.

AlarmEventRecord

The AlarmEventRecord service object represents a stored instance detected within the O-Cloud Resources and stored by the IMS.

The AlarmEventRecord can represent either a current active alarm or one that occurred in the past. Retention of an AlarmEventRecord is dependent on IMS configuration which would be set through an IMS Provisioning service.

The information representing an individual AlarmEventRecord follows the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.3.2-1.

Table 2.1.1.3.2-1: Attributes of the AlarmEventRecord

Attribute

Qualifier

Description

alarmEventRecordID

M

Identifier of an entry in the AlarmEventRecord. Locally unique within the scope of an O-Cloud instance.

resourceTypeID

M

A reference to the type of resource which caused the alarm.

resourceID

M

A reference to the resource instance which caused the alarm.

alarmDefinitionID

M

A reference to the Alarm Definition record in the Alarm Dictionary associated with the referenced Resource Type.

probableCauseID

M

A reference to the ProbableCause of the Alarm.

alarmRaisedTime

M

This field is populated with a Date/Time stamp value when the AlarmEventRecord is created.

alarmChangedTime

M

This field is populated with a Date/Time stamp value when any value of the AlarmEventRecord is modified.

alarmClearedTime

M

This field is populated with a Date/Time stamp value when the alarm condition is cleared.

alarmAcknowledgedTime

M

This field is populated with a Date/Time stamp value when the alarm condition is acknowledged.

alarmAcknowledged

M

This is a Boolean value defaulted to FALSE. When a system acknowledges an alarm, it is then set to TRUE.

perceivedSeverity

M

This is an enumerated set of values which identify the perceived severity of the alarm.

extensions

M

These are unspecified (not standardized) properties (keys) which are tailored by the vendor or operator to extend the information provided about the O-Cloud Alarm.

ProbableCauses

ProbableCauses provides further qualification as to the root cause of an alarm. Probable causes are more of a description and therefore somewhat verbose. They are represented by an assigned ID which when needed the textual attributes can be looked up. Many ProbableCauses are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.733 [27] and ITU-T Rec X.736 [28]. The probable cause gives an indication of a possible root cause(s) that might have triggered the alarm on the resource based on detectable signatures with the O-Cloud. Additional ProbableCauses can be added by the O-Cloud provider. Work to standardize the probable causes for O-Cloud is for FFS.

The information representing one probableCause follows the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.3.3-1.

Table 2.1.1.3.3-1: Attributes of the ProbableCause

Subscription

The Subscription service object represents an instance of a subscription to infrastructure fault notifications for when qualifying alarm list entry changes occur.

Subscriptions are required for a notification to be generated. A consumer, such as the SMO, establishes a valid subscription to alarms. Information about the alarm is provided to the consumer when the consumers specified criteria is met. The absence of a filter means all events are sent.

The information representing one subscription follows the provisions indicated in table 2.1.1.3.4-1.

consumerSubscriptionId

M

The consumer may provide its identifier for tracking, routing, or identifying the subscription used to report the event if a value was provided in the SubscriptionRequest.

filter

M

Criteria for events which do not need to be reported or will be filtered by the subscription notification service. Therefore, if a filter is not provided then all events are reported.

Infrastructure Monitoring Performance Service Objects

General

The O2ims_InfrastructureMonitoring services follow a flow described in the O2 GAP clause 3.9.9. This primarily consists of:

The Performance Measurement Store - used for storage and storage configuration of performance measurements.

The Performance Measurement Job - used to collect performance measurements and insert them into the Performance Measurement Store.

The Performance Measurement Subscription - used to identify what PerformanceMeasurementRecord(s) in the PeformanceMeasurementStore are reported, when they are reported, and how the report is to be delivered to the subscriber.

The Performance Measurement Report - The notification payload used to convey measurement values identified by a Performance Subscription to the identified subscriber in a format selected by the subscriber.

To see a complete description of the Alarm List Configure operation, refer to O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [23], clause 3.7.11.

The IMS keeps all the current alarms in an Alarm List. The Retention Period of alarms can be changed by the Alarm List Configure operation. After the Retention Period expires, alarms in the Alarm List will be purged or archived based on alarm policy. For example, the Alarm List Configure request could have an attribute to specify to Retention Period by the IMS of Compute Node alarms (resource types) for 72 hours. When the current value of the retentionPeriod is reduced then the Alarm Purge Use Case is triggered, found in O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [23], clause 3.7.13.

Another Alarm List Configure operation could adjust the value(s) in the Extension attribute list of the Alarm List. Additional extensions attributes in the Alarm List Management request could change other aspects of Alarm List Management behavior. This would allow for implementation specific behavior. For example, an extension attribute might cause alarms purged or archived based on triggers. Extensions might define overflow behavior, or Alarm List composition handling.

For further information on the Performance Measurement Job Creation Use Case, see O-RAN WG6 ORCH-USE-CASES [23], Clause 3.8.1.

To create a Performance Measurement Job, a requestor would provide the following upon invoking the service operation:

Consumer Performance Job Id – This is an identifier provided by the consumer for purposes of managing PM Jobs. This value could be the same across multiple instances of a PM Job.

Resource Scope Criteria – The Resource Scope Criteria determines the value set for the Qualified Resource Types. It allows for the requestor of the Service Operation to indicate the list of Resources of interest from which measures are to be collected. This criterion determines, the value set for the Qualified Resource Types (See Note).

Measurement Selection Criteria – This is provided by the requestor at time of Performance Measurement Job creation to describe the measurements and/or resources that the PM Job is responsible for collecting and calculating. If a Resource Type is specified in the order, then the Performance Measurement Job operations applies to all resources of that Resource Type. From the Resource Scope Criteria, the Resource Types of interest can be calculated and from that the relevant PM Dictionaries. The Measurement Selection Criteria can then use these PM Dictionaries to identify the measurements of interest.

 NOTE:	It is up to the protocol and data model specification to determine the one or various protocol operations enabling the authorized consumer to retrieve the Performance Measurement Job information.

The input parameters sent when invoking the operation shall support the means to:

Specify an order that defines the Resource Scope Criteria, Measured Resources and Resources Type which indicates the pertinent resources for the Performance Measurement Job. From these the relevant PM Dictionaries can be identified.

Specify an order that defines the Measurement Selection Criteria that the Performance Measurement Job would be responsible for. The relevant attributes given in an order to create a PerformanceMeasurementJob Information Object Class are specified in O-Cloud Information Model in O-RAN WG6.IM [36].

As a result of the PM Job Create service operation, the producer (O-Cloud) shall indicate to the consumer whether the PM Job Create service operation was processed successfully. As a result, this operation will return the status of the newly created PM jobs running in the IMS. If the operation is not successful, the O-Cloud shall return to the consumer the appropriate error information.

The producer determines the Measured Resources as a list of Resources relevant to the PM Job; it is a read-only attribute derived from the Measurement Selection Criteria. Furthermore, the Collected Measurements are derived from the Resource Scope Criteria and Measurement Selection Criteria; this gives the measurements to be collected by the PM Job.

The Qualified Resource Types are computed from the evaluation of the Measurement Selection Criteria, thus is derived during the PM Job Create Service Operation. It is also part of the Information Model. These are byproducts of the operation inputs. The computation from the Resource Scope Criteria results in a unique set of Resource Types relevant to the PM Job create service operation. From those resources, Resource Types of interest can be calculated. From those, the associated PM Dictionaries can be deduced. From the Measurement Selection Criteria, the Qualified Measurements that the PM Job is responsible for is calculated. The Qualified Resource Type allows an operator to check these interim results.

After the service operation completes, the IMS puts the PM Job into the Active State; and it immediately starts collecting measurements based on its collection interval.

The full requirements definitions can be found in O-RAN WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [23], clause 4.3. The following identifiers uniquely specify the requirements applicable to the producer (O-Cloud) for this operation: [REQ-ORC-O2-32].

Logging Services

Service description

Logging Services have service operations that are related to the operation and management of Logging functions within the O-Cloud. Logs can be kept at different entities within an O-Cloud. They can be kept within O-Cloud resources, Clusters, and the IMS. Each of those entities can generate different kinds of logs including Alarm, Fault, Debug, Trace, Security, and Informational logs.

Service operations

Logging Configuration Service Operation

The Logging Configuration is related to how the IMS administrates, provisions, and configures logging management for logs that are generated in the O-Cloud. There are many kinds of logs that may exist in the O-Cloud such as Alarm Logs, Fault Logs, Debug Logs, and other logs. See O-RAN WG6.O2-GA&P [24], clause 3.8.19 for more details. This service operation will configure the logging behaviour of those logs. Further logging management configuration for specific types of logs are implementation specific.

Examples of elements that can be configured through the Logging Configuration Service Operation are the retention period, the activation of logging, logging behaviour (e.g., rotation of older logs (FIFO)), and log levels. Not all logs will have each of these kinds of configurable attributes.

See O-RAN WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [23], clause 3.7.10 Logging Management Use Case for more information.

The Logging Configuration Service Operation is related to the Log Capability Query (IMS) Service Operation (see NOTE 1) because Logging Configuration sets the behaviour how IMS handles the management of logging.

NOTE 1:	The Log Capability Query Service Operation is not defined in the present document.

NOTE 2:	It is up to the protocol and data model specification to determine the one or various protocol operations enabling the authorized consumer to retrieve the O-Cloud information.

Log Type – Specify types of Log(s) supported for the IMS and O-Cloud Resources. These might include, but are not limited to Alarm Logs, Fault Logs, Debug Logs. Other logs could be described in the input parameter as well.

Retention Period – Specify the Retention Period for the different types of Log(s). This attribute indicates the period of time for which a particular type of Log would be retained for.

Logging State – This is an attribute to indicate the activate state for a particular type of Log. Each Log Type might have an active or inactive state to indicate whether that Log Type is used or not.

Expiry method – Configure logging expiry method for a type of Log which describes what happens if the age of a Log exceeds the Retention Period. The expiry methods could include behaviours such as LIFO, FIFO, and FILO.

Logging Level – Configure the Logging Level(s) for the Logs of interest. See O-RAN WG6.O2-GA&P [24], clause 3.8.20 for more details.

O2ims_InfrastructureProvisioning Services

Service description

The O-Cloud, as a distributed cloud, is connected by transport WANs. The Resource Pool therefore has to be configured for ingress and egress rules onto the transport networks for Front-Haul, Mid-Haul, and Back-Haul. Other activities such as creating logical resource groups within a Resource Pool and other types of O-Cloud configuration activities are provided by the O2ims_InfrastructureProvisioning services.

Service operations

FFS

O2ims_InfrastructureSoftwareManagement Services

Service description

The O2ims_InfrastructureSoftware Management services support procedures that enable SMO/FOCOM to initiate the software update process for the O-Cloud Infrastructure Management software, the Deployment Management software, Server OS Software, updates, and patches, and firmware updates for accelerators. For initial release the O-Cloud software can be manually updated. Therefore, the orchestrated Software Update procedure is deferred FFS.

 O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycleManagement Services

Service description

Although O-Clouds are usually built for future capacity, they are not static. Physical resources can become defective or obsolete. Also, the O-Cloud may grow beyond its initial deployed capacity. These activities represent life cycle events to the O-Cloud. Automation is expected to offload manual processes due to the high numbers expected of O-Cloud instances. O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycleManagement Services support procedures for the automation of O-Clouds lifecycle events.

Service operations

Primary Use cases for O-Cloud Genesis and O-Cloud Scaling are FFS. However, for this release the Notification to a callback specified at the onset of O-Cloud Genesis is defined.

O-Cloud Available Event Notification

The O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycle service shall provide a consumer who was established at the onset of O-Cloud Genesis. Data expected to be included with the callback URI in the genesis data is the globalCloudID, each globalLocationID, and each AssetID for infrastructure at those locations. Once enough of the O-Cloud is discovered, provisioned and is available for additional provisioning or workload deployments, the O-Cloud shall send the O-CloudAvailableEvent to the consumer (SMO), thus registering its InfrastructureManagementServiceEndPoint with the SMO. After receiving the notification, the SMO will interogate the InfrastructureInventory APIs to account for corporate assets and discover the DMS service endpoints to allow workloads to be deployed.

NOTE:	It is up to the protocol and data model specification to determine the one or various protocol operations enabling the notification service to invoke the specified callback procedure.

API definitions

General aspects

Introduction

The present document defines the protocol and data model for the following O2ims service interfaces in the form of RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) specifications:

O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API (as produced by the O-Cloud towards the SMO).

O2ims_InfrastructureMonitoring Service API (as produced by the O-Cloud towards the SMO)

O2ims_InfrastructureProvisioning Service API (as produced by the O-Cloud towards the SMO)

O2ims_InfrastructureSoftwareManagement Service API (as produced by the O-Cloud towards the SMO)

O2ims_InfrastructureLifecycleManagement Service API (as produced by the O-Cloud towards the SMO).

Table 3.1.1-1 lists the versions of the APIs defined in the present document.

The design of the protocol and data model for the above interfaces is based on the information model and requirements defined in XXX [Error! Reference source not found.]. In clause 3, general aspects are specified that apply to multiple APIs for O2ims services. In addition, the provisions in clauses 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.1.7, and 3.1.8 define common aspects of RESTful APIs, and shall apply for all APIs defined in the present document.

In the subsequent clauses, the protocol and data model for the individual interfaces are specified. Per interface, the resource structure with associated HTTP methods is defined and applicable flows are provided. Further, the resources and the data model are specified in detail.

Even though the different interfaces defined in the present document are related, implementations shall not assume a particular order of messages that arrive via different interfaces.

URI structure and supported content formats

This clause specifies the URI prefix and the supported formats applicable to the O2ims RESTful APIs.

All resource URIs of the APIs shall have the following prefix, except the "API versions" resource which shall follow the rules specified in clause 9.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22]:

	{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/

The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API service consumer towards the API service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [11], i.e.:

{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>

with the following components:

-	The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [11].

-	The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. The {apiName} of each interface is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding O2ims RESTful API.

-	The <apiMajorVersion> indicates the current major version of the API and is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding O2ims RESTful API.

-	The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> indicates a resource URI of the API, and shall be set as described in in the corresponding O2ims RESTful API for each one of the defined resources.

Either HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [19], or HTTP/1.1, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [30] shall be used.

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as specified in IETF RFC 793 [31] shall be used as transport protocol for HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1.

For HTTP requests and responses that have a body, the content format JSON (see IETF RFC 8259 [20]) shall be supported. The JSON format shall be signalled by the content type "application/json".

All APIs shall support and use HTTP over TLS (also known as HTTPS) (see IETF RFC 2818 [32]). At least support TLS version 1.2 but recommended to support TLS version 1.3 as defined by IETF RFC 5246 [33] shall be supported.

NOTE 1:	The HTTP protocol elements mentioned in the O2ims RESTful APIs originate from the HTTP specification; HTTPS runs the HTTP protocol on top of a TLS layer. For simplicity, the O2ims RESTful APIs specifications therefore use the statement above to mention "HTTP request", "HTTP header", etc., without explicitly calling out HTTPS.

NOTE 2:	There are a number of best practices and guidelines how to configure and implement TLS 1.2 in a secure manner, as security threats evolve. A detailed specification of those is beyond the scope of the present document; the reader is referred to external documentation such as annex E of ETSI TS 133 310 [35].

All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [34]. An implementation that dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of path segments that are separated by "/", query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the character set that is allowed by IETF RFC 3986 [34] for these parts.

NOTE 3:	This means that characters not part of this allowed set are escaped using percent-encoding as defined by IETF RFC 3986 [34].

Unless otherwise specified explicitly, all request URI parameters that are part of the path of the resource URI shall be individual path segments, i.e., shall not contain the "/" character.

NOTE 4:	A request URI parameter is denoted by a string in curly brackets, e.g. {fooId}.

Usage of HTTP header fields

General

HTTP headers are components of the header section of the HTTP request and response messages. They contain the information about the server/client and metadata of the transaction. The use of HTTP header fields shall comply with the provisions defined for those header fields in the specifications referenced from tables 3.1.3.2-1 and 3.1.3.3-1. The following clauses describe more details related to selected HTTP header fields.

Request header fields

Result set control

Introduction

This clause specifies procedures that allow to control the size of the result set of GET requests w.r.t. the number of entries in a response list (using attribute-based filtering) or w.r.t. the number of attributes returned in a response (using attribute selection).

Attribute-based filtering and selector

The use of attribute-based filtering shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].

NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.

Handling of large query results

The handling of large query results shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].

Error reporting

In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is generally not enough to discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error information is typically delivered.

The error reporting shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 6 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].

NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.

NOTE 1:	Individual API specifications are assumed to define types for additional identifiers with dedicated scope (e.g. identifiers scoped by some O-Cloud).

NOTE 2:	In the JSON instance data model, only the concept of a "number" is used to represent numerical data. Numbers in JSON can be integral, i.e. have no fractional part, or can include a fractional part. The additional numeric types defined in the present document represent constraints on the general "number" type present in JSON instances which can be enforced e.g. during parsing when processing the JSON instance or expressed as constraints in modelling languages such as JSON Schema [ref-json-scheme] or OpenAPI [ref-openapi].

Authorization of API requests and notifications

Introduction

The present version of this document does not specify specific authorization mechanisms to be considered for handling API requests and notifications specified in the present document. It is expected that implementations will leverage best practices and guidelines from relevant standards such as those defined in:

-	IETF RFC 5246 [ref-rfc5246] for the use of TLS 1.2/1.3,

-	IETF RFC 7235 [ref-rfc7235] for authentication mechanisms over HTTP/1.1,

-	IETF RFC 6749 [ref-rfc6749] for the use of OAuth 2.0 authorization framework,

-	IETF RFC 7519 [ref-rfc7519] for use of JSON web tokens.

Version management

Version identifiers and parameters

API version identifiers and rules for incrementing version identifier fields shall be supported by O2ims RESTful APIs as specified in clause 9.1 and 9.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].

NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification and OpenAPI specification that ETSI publishes; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" and OpenAPI that O-RAN publishes is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.

Clause 9.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] provides examples of backward and non-backward compatible changes.

Version information retrieval and signaling

The API producer shall support the dedicated URIs to enable API consumers to retrieve information about API versions supported by an API producer as specified in clause 9.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22], and the API consumer shall include the "Version" HTTP header in each HTTP request as specified in clause 9.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22].

NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [22] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2ims RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.

O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API

Description

This API allows the SMO to invoke O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Services towards the O-Cloud.

The operations defined for O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Services through this API are:

Query information about one or multiple Resource Type

Query information about one or multiple Resource Pool

Query information about one or multiple Resource

Query information about one or multiple Deployment Manager

Query information about one or multiple Subscriptions

Notify consumer identified by an established subscription which is not filtered by the filter criteria of the occurrence of a change to the infrastructure inventory objects

API version

For the O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API version as specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be 1, the MINOR version field shall be 0, and the PATCH version field shall be 0.

REST resources structure and methods

All resource URIs of the API shall use the base URI specification defined in clause 3.1.2. The string "O2ims_infrastructureInventory" shall be used to represent {apiName}. All resource URIs in the clauses below are defined relative to the formed base URI (i.e., {apiRoot}/O2ims_infrastructureInventory/{apiVersion}).

When ambiguity is possible, the term REST resource is used to make the distinction between the term resource as understood within the context of REST API from the term resource as understood within the context of O-RAN.

Figure 3.2.3-1 shows the overall resource URI structure defined for the O2ims_InfrastructureInventory Service API.

Figure 3.2.3-1 Resource URI structure of the O2ims-infrastructureInventory API

Table 3.2.31provides an overview of the resources and applicable HTTP methods.

The O-Cloud shall support responding to requests for all HTTP methods on the resources in table 3.2.3-1 that are marked as "M" (mandatory) in the "Cat" column. The O-Cloud shall also support the "API versions" resources as specified in clause 3.1.8.
