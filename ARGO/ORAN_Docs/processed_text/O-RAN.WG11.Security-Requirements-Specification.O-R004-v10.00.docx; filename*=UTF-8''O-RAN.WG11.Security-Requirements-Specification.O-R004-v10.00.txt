composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred
within a system or network." Defined in NIST SP 800-92 [58], clause 2.

Log streaming: In information technology, log streaming refers to the near real-time transmission and analysis of log data generated by various software applications, systems, or devices.

MAC Security Entity (SecY): The entity that operates the MAC Security protocol within a system.

Management and Orchestration Event: Events generated by SMO operations.

Near-RT RIC: O-RAN near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller: a logical function that enables real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained data collection and actions over E2 interface.

Network Events: Events generated by network activity from operating systems, hypervisors, or container engines.

Non-RT RIC: O-RAN non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller: a logical function that enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources, AI/ML workflow including model training and updates, and policy-based guidance of applications/features in Near-RT RIC.

O-CU: O-RAN Central Unit: a logical node hosting O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

O-Cloud Compute Pool: It refers to a cohesive set of computational resources within the O-Cloud infrastructure where multiple nodes work in harmony to provide a unified environment designed to host and manage O-RAN applications and services. In the context of Kubernetes, an O-Cloud Compute Pool is equivalent to a "cluster".

O-Cloud instance ID: The O-Cloud instance ID is a unique identifier assigned to components within the O-Cloud platform, including VMs, pods, containers, nodes, and compute pools (E.g., a cluster in Kubernetes). This ensures uniqueness across the entire O-Cloud environment, irrespective of the component type. For instance, a VM, a pod, a container, a node, and a cluster will each have a distinct O-Cloud instance ID within the platform, ensuring that there is no ambiguity in identification.

O-Cloud nodes: An O-Cloud node refers to a computational unit or entity within the O-Cloud infrastructure. It serves as a host for running O-RAN applications. Each O-Cloud node contributes computational resources, storage, and networking capabilities to the overall O-Cloud system, ensuring scalability, redundancy, and efficient workload distribution.

O-Cloud platform software component: A software module within the O-Cloud platform that provides essential functionalities and services to enable the deployment, management, and utilization of O-Cloud resources by O-RAN Network Functions. Some examples of O-Cloud platform software component include virtual machine managers, container orchestration frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes control plane) and database services.

O-CU-CP: O-RAN Central Unit – Control Plane: a logical node hosting the RRC and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol.

O-CU-UP: O-RAN Central Unit – User Plane: a logical node hosting the user plane part of the PDCP protocol and the SDAP protocol.

O-DU: O-RAN Distributed Unit: a logical node hosting RLC/MAC/High-PHY layers based on a lower layer functional split.

O-RU: O-RAN Radio Unit: a logical node hosting Low-PHY layer and RF processing based on a lower layer functional split.

O-RAN vendor: Provider of any component of O-RAN

O1: Interface between management entities (NMS/EMS/MANO) and O-RAN managed elements, for operation and management.

O2: Interface between SMO and the O-Cloud to provide cloud resources management and workload management for supporting O-RAN cloudified network functions.

R1: Interface between rApps and Non-RT RIC Framework via which R1 Services can be produced and consumed.

R1 Services: A collection of services including, but not limited to, service registration and discovery services, authentication and authorization services, AI/ML workflow services, and A1, O1 and O2 related services.

RAN: Generally referred as Radio Access Network.

rApps: Non-RT RIC application: an application designed to consume and/or produce R1 services.

rApp instance: An individual occurrence of an application running in the Non-RT RIC runtime environment. [37]

rApp instance identifier: A unique identifier for each rApp instance, assigned by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework during rApp registration. [37].

red-side: Identifies the Ethernet Data Encryption device (EDE) port that does not use MACsec to protect transmitted frames or verify received frames.

Security Controls: A solution designed to meet a set of defined security requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of O-RAN elements.

Security Log: A log that contains audit records and security-related system events.

Sensitive: A descriptor of information whose loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or modification could adversely affect security [i.12].

Service Management and Orchestration (SMO): The O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration system as specified in the O-RAN Architecture Description (OAD) document [2], clause 5.3.1.

Shared Data Layer (SDL): API for accessing shared data storage.

Solution Provider: An application developer who delivers applications to Service Providers. [16].

Service Provider: A network provider who is planning to deploy applications into their network. [16].

NOTE:	The term is also used to refer to the Telco Operator and/or the O-Cloud Provider since the Application package verification might be performed by both or by one or the other, depending upon the O-Cloud deployment models. The Telco Operator might act as the O-Cloud Provider (in case of private cloud model), or they might be two different entities (in case of hybrid or public cloud models).

System Events: "System events are operational actions performed by OS components, such as shutting down the system or starting a service. Typically, failed events and the most significant successful events are logged, but many OSs permit administrators to specify which types of events will be logged. The details logged for each event also vary widely; each event is usually timestamped, and other supporting information could include event, status, and error codes; service name; and user or system account associated with an event." Defined in NIST SP 800-92 [58], clause 2.1.2.

Time of Day (ToD): Within the O-Cloud, ToD represents the precise hour, minute, and second of a day, serving as a unified time reference across the infrastructure.

EXAMPLE:		E2 related APIs are considered time critical APIs

API Security – Authorization

 In the actual context of Near-RT RIC, the platform as API producer shall be responsible to specify those rights/privileges for the platform services as resources to the xApps as consumers. As a guideline, an xApp should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more.

Authorization mechanisms shall be enforced by the Near-RT RIC platform in the following key API procedures [33]:

Discovery of Near-RT RIC APIs: The Near-RT RIC platform shall provide means to restrict xApps from discovery of some published APIs based on configuration policies.

E2 Subscription API procedure: The subscription management shall be based on operator’s policies. An xApp may be restricted to interface with only a subset of E2 Nodes by such policies. This procedure establishes a set of preconditions that assume authorization processes:

xApp has been authorized to issue E2 Subscription API requests

xApp has been authorized to request guidance from Conflict mitigation

xApp Subscription Management has been configured to permit E2 Subscription API requests only from specific list of xApps.

E2 Control API procedure: Only authorized xApps may initiate RIC control request messages issued by the Near-RT RIC over the E2 interface to the E2 Nodes, for a specific scope.

EXAMPLE 1:	E2Nodes include E2 Node list, RAN function

E2 Guidance API procedure: Ensure only authorized xApp obtain guidance from the conflict mitigation platform function prior to initiating an action.

SDL API procedures: xApps shall have been successfully registered and authorized prior to consuming the services exposed by SDL API.

EXAMPLE 2:	Services exposed by SDL API may be client registration, fetch data, notification, store

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-3: Transactional APIs (REST and gRPC)  in Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 authorization framework as specified in in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.

The roles defined in OAuth 2.0 are assigned as follows:

Client (consumer): xApp

Grants shall be of the type Client Credentials Grant, as described in IETF RFC 6749 [34], clause 4.4. Mutual authentication using mTLS as specified in the O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.2 shall be used.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-4: For A1-P, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 resource owner/server, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7, for service requests received from a Non-RT RIC.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-5: For A1-EI, Near-RT RIC shall support OAuth 2.0 client, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.

The policies are being received at or below a pre-defined rate.

The Near-RT RIC shall log security event(s) if any of the policy verification steps fail.

	EXAMPLE:		In practice, policy value validation verifies that values are within the predefined range

Security controls for the Y1 interface protocol structure solution 1

The Y1 interface protocol structure solution 1 is defined in the O-RAN ALLIANCE TS: "Y1 interface: General Aspects and Principles" [66], clause 7.2.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-9: The Y1 interface shall support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication via X.509v3 certificates, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.2.

NOTE 1:	In mTLS, both the client (the Y1 consumer) and the server (the Y1 provider) require a certificate, and both sides authenticate each other using their public/private key pair.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-10: The Y1 interface shall support the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.7.

The roles defined in OAuth 2.0 shall be assigned as follows:

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-11: The Y1 interface shall support TLS, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.2, to provide data confidentiality, integrity, and replay-protection.

xApp Registration – Security procedure

As part of the xApp registration procedure to the Near-RT RIC platform, the platform assigns an identity (ID) to the xApp, so called xApp ID. This xApp ID is used in xApp’s API request messages to the Near-RT RIC platform to facilitate the Near-RT RIC platform the identification of the xApp (API service consumer).

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-12: The xApp ID shall be embedded into the provided xApp X.509 certificate used for authentication (mTLS) according to the parametrization in [3], issued by operator RA/CA PKI infrastructure.

NOTE 1:	The security procedure to become part of the existing xApp registration procedure, specified in O-RAN ALLIANCE TS:  "Near-RT RIC Architecture" [33], clause 9.1.4 where xApp ID is assigned, is detailed in the Figure 5.1.3.2-1.

Figure 5.1.3.21 : Security procedure for xApp registration

1. As a pre-requisite to the registration procedure, the xApp obtains information from a provisioning system (NFO in SMO) during the onboarding/deployment phase in the infrastructure. This information is used to authenticate and establish a secure TLS communication with the Near-RT RIC platform during the registration process. The information includes details of the Near-RT RIC platform (address, Root CA certificate) and includes an initial registration credential.

NOTE 2: 	An OAuth 2.0 access token is provided as initial registration credential in the example. Other types of credentials in the initial registration can be used.

2. The xApp and Near-RT RIC platform establish a TLS session (server-side certificate authentication) using the information obtained in step 1.

3. The xApp generates the private and public key pair, and CSR (Certificate Signing Request).

4. After successful establishment of the TLS session, the xApp instance sends a registration request message to the Near-RT RIC platform along with the pre-provisioned initial registration credential (OAuth 2.0 token), and the xApp instance CSR message.

5. The Near-RT RIC platform shall validate the initial registration credential, and the Management Function of the platform shall generate an xApp ID for that particular xApp instance. At the reception of the CSR message from the xApp, the Registration Authority (RA), implemented in the Near-RT RIC platform, shall prove that the xApp instance is in possession of the private key. If the proof of possession procedure is positive, the RA shall configure a policy to add the xApp ID in the Subject Alt Name (SAN) field of the certificate request message to be forwarded to the Operator CA to fetch the end entity certificate.

NOTE 3:	The RA may use an enrolment protocol to fetch the certificate from the CA. The authentication mechanism between RA and CA are part of the operator PKI implementation.

6. The RA requests the certificate for the xApp instance.

7. Operator CA issues a certificate, embedding the xApp ID in SAN field of the certificate. The issued certificate by the operator CA will be used by the xApp for subsequent authentication and authorization procedures between the xApp and the Near-RT RIC platform when services/resources are consumed by xApps via APIs.

8. The Near-RT RIC platform (Management Function) generates an xApp Managed Object Instance (MOI) as specified in [33], which may contain the mechanism for authentication (mTLS) and authorization (OAuth 2.0) between the xApp and the corresponding module of the Near-RT RIC platform.

9. The Near-RT RIC platform (Management Function) responds with a xApp registration response message. The response shall include the assigned xApp ID, authentication, and authorization mechanism (if provided in step 8) and xApp certificate.

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-13: The data type of the xApp ID shall be a string that uniquely identifies the xApp instance. The format of this string shall be a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) version 4 as described in IETF RFC 4122 [77].

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-14:  subjectAltName in the xApp instance certificate shall contain a URI-ID with the URI for the xApp ID as an URN; this URI-ID shall contain the xApp ID of the xApp instance using the UUID format as described in IETF RFC 4122 [77].

	EXAMPLE 1:	urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

SEC-CTL-NEAR-RT-15: The Near-RT RIC shall verify data received through the Y1 interface as follows:

The data values are valid.

Requirements

REQ-SEC-O-CLOUD-HW-1: O-Cloud hardware deployment shall be protected against unauthorized extraction or inference of sensitive information using physical methods.

	NOTE:	O-Cloud hardware deployment refers to the hardware used to build the operator’s O-Cloud infrastructure.

	NOTE:	O-Cloud hardware deployment refers to the hardware used to build the operator’s O-Cloud infrastructure.

O-Cloud instance ID

Introduction

The following set of requirements and controls outlines the essential criteria concerning the O-Cloud instance ID. This ID is a cornerstone for uniquely identifying and managing various components, including VMs, pods, containers, nodes, and compute pools within the O-Cloud platform. Safeguarding its global uniqueness, preserving its confidentiality and integrity, and controlling its accessibility are crucial to prevent conflicts, unauthorized access, and potential system compromises.

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-1: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be unique within the O-Cloud platform to prevent conflicts and ensure accurate identification.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-2: The O-Cloud instance ID shall not be exposed in public-facing interfaces, APIs, or logs without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-3: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be protected to ensure confidentiality and integrity, both during storage (at rest) and while being transmitted (in transit).

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-4: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be subject to auditing and monitoring, with detailed logs maintained to track activities related to the instance's creation, usage, modification, and deletion.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-INST-ID-5: The O-Cloud instance ID shall be associated with a single component, be it a VM, container, pod, node, or compute pool, to ensure clear resource ownership, traceability, and accountability.

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-INST-ID-1: O-Cloud instance IDs shall be generated using strong randomization methods to ensure a high degree of uniqueness and minimize the likelihood of collisions.

	EXAMPLE:	Implementation (Kubernetes-specific)

Kubernetes generates unique instance IDs, called Pod names, by combining factors like pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and contextual information. PRNGs use an initial seed and deterministic algorithms to produce random-like numbers. These numbers, along with contextual elements like timestamps and namespace identifiers, form the basis of the Pod names. This approach ensures that generated names are non-guessable, unpredictable, and unlikely to collide within the Kubernetes cluster. The combination of PRNGs, randomization, and context guarantees that instance IDs are secure, unique, and suitable for identifying pods within the system.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-INST-ID-2: O-Cloud should validate newly generated instance IDs against existing IDs to guarantee uniqueness before finalizing instance creation.

Time Synchronization and Consistency Requirements for O-Cloud

Introduction

The requirements listed below highlight the O-Cloud's focus on creating a secure time synchronization framework with NTP as the focus. The requirement and security controls below in this clause are not applicable to PTP. By ensuring each node of the O-Cloud connects to a trusted and authenticated time source, O-Cloud aims to enhance its defences against threats such as clock manipulation, data inconsistencies and operational disruptions.

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-1: All O-Cloud nodes shall be configured to connect to a secure and authenticated time synchronization server for ToD synchronization.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-2: The O-Cloud shall be configured such that ToD synchronization is maintained across all nodes in an O-Cloud compute pool, there by guaranteeing uniform time references for all applications hosted on these nodes.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-3: The O-Cloud shall guarantee that the timestamp consistency is preserved even when applications are relocated across different nodes of the O-Cloud infrastructure.

	NOTE 1:	Timestamp refers to:

Log/event timestamps: These are associated with each log entry generated. Examples include application start/stop, application relocation, node failures, network events, change in applications and O-Cloud configuration, resource allocation, deallocation, etc.

Data Transaction timestamps: For applications that rely on time-sensitive data within O-Cloud, consistent timestamps are crucial. Whenever data is read, written, or modified, a timestamp is generated to ensure both data integrity and consistency across nodes.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-4: The O-Cloud shall guarantee that various instances of an identical application, irrespective of their location, generate logs with consistent timestamps.

NOTE 2:	Within the O-Cloud infrastructure, a "consistent timestamp" denotes the synchronized and uniform  chronological markers generated by various instances of an identical application, irrespective of their location. This uniformity ensures that aggregated or analysed logs from different instances present a coherent chronological sequence, aiding in precise event correlation and analysis. To achieve and maintain this consistency, it's recommended for O-Cloud to synchronize its internal clocks with trusted time sources, such as NTP servers, guaranteeing both the accuracy and trustworthiness of these timestamps.

REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-TS-5: All O-Cloud nodes within a compute pool, especially those serving a specific geographic region or co-located, shall be configured to operate using a consistent time reference, preferably UTC with a Time Zone (TZ) modifier.

	NOTE 3:	This requirement ensures:

Uniformity in Time-Related Operations: Simplifies the process of correlating logs, events, and time-sensitive operations across nodes, aiding in quicker identification of anomalies or malicious activities.

Operational Consistency: Ensures that scheduled tasks, backups, updates, or maintenance activities are executed consistently across the compute pool.

Data Integrity: Provides consistency for applications and databases that rely on timestamps for transactions, ensuring no discrepancies due to time differences.

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-TS-1: The O-Cloud shall ensure that all nodes are configured to exclusively connect to a secure and authenticated time synchronization server for Time of Day (ToD) synchronization.

	EXAMPLE 1:	NTP Usage

The O-Cloud should primarily use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) for general time synchronization needs, ensuring consistent timestamps for operations such as logging security events. This connection should prioritize the use of NTP with authentication mechanisms in place to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the time data. The authentication mechanisms provided by NTPv4 should be employed for NTP. This includes the use of symmetric key cryptography to authenticate the time server. Additionally, consideration will be given to implementing NTP over MACsec to enhance security, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the time synchronization data.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-TS-2: All O-Cloud nodes shall be configured to synchronize their clocks exclusively with centralized time servers at regular intervals to ensure uniformity in time-related operations and data across the O-Cloud infrastructure.

	EXAMPLE 2:	Time synchronization protocol such as NTP can be used to achieve this consistency.

NTP: While NTP provides millisecond-level accuracy, it's widely adopted and can be sufficient for many applications in the O-Cloud. The reference points here would be the stratum 1-time servers or atomic clocks that NTP servers synchronize with.

SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-TS-3: The O-Cloud should establish multiple time servers for redundancy. This ensures that nodes can switch to an alternative trusted server if the primary server becomes unavailable, thereby maintaining consistent time synchronization.

EXAMPLE 3:	NTP Redundancy

By configuring nodes to have a list of NTP servers, they can automatically switch to a secondary or tertiary server if the primary server fails. This ensures continuous time synchronization and mitigates the risk of a single point of failure.

	NOTE:	See clause 5.3.8.9.2 for additional security controls.

Open Fronthaul Interface

C-plane

Introduction

The O-DU sends UL C-plane messages and DL C-plane messages to O-RU to trigger transmission and reception of RF signals. The DL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive at O-RU within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive DL I/Q data in U-plane messages from O-DU. Likewise, the UL C-plane message describing multiple symbols must arrive within a certain time window for the O-RU to successfully receive RF signal and send UL I/Q data in U-plane messages to O-DU. Any delay of these messages would cause the O-RU to drop/discard U-plane traffic from O-DU and the UE [31].

An adversary can inject its own DL C-plane or UL C-plane messages by spoofing the associated O-DU. As a result, it would block the O-RU from processing the corresponding U-Plane packets received from the O-DU and O-RU respectively, leading to temporary DoS and, limited cell performance on cells served by the O-RU [4]. Additionally, it may tamper with Downlink (DL) C-Plane messages to exploit possible vulnerabilities in the C-Plane protocol or C-Plane endpoint implementation. This can cause an active cell to become a sleeping cell, leading to cell unavailability and a temporary Denial-of-Service (DoS).

Attackers may overwhelm a target system's network bandwidth or computing resources by flooding it with a massive volume of traffic known as volumetric Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack causing Bandwidth Exhaustion, Network Consumption, and Resource Consumption.

An adversary can engage in passive monitoring to monitor the beamforming information for reconnaissance purposes.  The flow indicator (eAxCID) in clear text allows an attacker to target a user at a specific location, potentially planning attacks based on the user's known location.

The clear text nature of the C-Plane messages over the ethernet exposes the open-fronthaul to the threats described above.

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OFCP-1: The C-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of O-DUs that exchange C-plane messages with O-RUs.

REQ-SEC-OFCP-2: The O-DU shall be able to detect and defend against application level attacks across the C-Plane messages with O-RUs, due to misbehaviour or malicious intent.

REQ-SEC-OFCP-3: Authenticity-, integrity and anti-replay protection should protect C-Plane data flows through the fronthaul network.

REQ-SEC-OFCP-4: The C-Plane data should be confidentiality protected.

Security Controls

Authentication and Authorization of network elements supporting the C-Plane

This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-1 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of nodes that exchange C-Plane messages.

Clause 5.2.5.5 provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of an O-DU and other network elements supporting the C-Plane within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

This clause provides controls for requirements REQ-SEC-OFCP-3 and REQ-SEC-OFCP-4 based on the use of MACsec [79].

SEC-CTL-OFCP-1: The Open Fronthaul network elements should secure the C-Plane data by encapsulating it inside MACsec [79].

 Clause 5.2.5.6 of this document provides the solutions for protection of Open Fronthaul messages and defines the  security controls for encryption of the C-Plane data on the Open Fronthaul network segment.

U-plane

Introduction

Open Fronthaul U-plane transports 3GPP Access Stratum (AS) Control Plane and User Plane messages between O-CU-CP and UE, and O-CU-UP and UE.  3GPP AS Control Plane and User Plane messages that are transported via the Open Fronthaul U-Plane (LLS-UP) are confidentiality and integrity protected by Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) [32][55]. The PDCP [32] security controls remain in place when the message traverses the Open Fronthaul U-Plane.

However, there are certain U-Plane messages  containing IQ samples, PRACH, PUCCH, SSB, O-RAN Application and eCPRI headers that are transported  over Open Fronthaul as encapsulated Ethernet packets without integrity protection.

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OFUP-1: Authenticity, integrity and anti-replay protection should protect the U-Plane data packets that are transported in clear text through the fronthaul network.

Security Controls

Securing the U-Plane data using MACsec

This clause provides security controls for REQ-SEC-OFUP-1 using MACsec [79] .

SEC-CTL-OFUP-1: The Open Fronthaul network elements may secure the U-Plane data by encapsulating it inside MACsec.

S-plane

Introduction

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks within a PTP network. Within a PTP domain [27], the grandmaster clock is the source of time to which all other PTP clocks in the domain are synchronized.

The IEEE 1588 standard [27] specifies the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) for electing the best clock from PTP Network and Local PTP Clock. The BMCA runs on PTP instances in the network continuously and is adjusting to changes in that network. PTP ANNOUNCE messages are used to build a timing distribution hierarchy with grandmaster at the top. There can be many grandmasters in PTP Network, but PTP Domain can have only one. The chosen grandmaster clock is responsible for providing timing to the PTP slave nodes.

Following the selection of the new grandmaster, the grandmaster begins transmitting the current time within the SYNC message and FOLLOW_UP messages if applicable. This allows the other clocks to synchronize their time to the grandmaster.

S-Plane attacks include an attacker masquerading as a grandmaster or manipulating PTP to degrade synchronization. An attacker within the PTP network could impersonate the master clock’s grandmaster’s Identity value and propose himself as a grandmaster candidate by sending fake ANNOUNCE messages declaring him to be the best clock in the network. The malicious GM would provide intentionally inaccurate timing information that results in degradation in the accuracy of time synchronisation and may cause DoS to applications on all the RUs that rely on accurate time synchronisation, potentially bringing down the cell.

 Details are covered in [4], clause 7.4.1.2.

The two most common deployment models for O-DU in O-RAN are:

O-DU at the cell site deployment model: the O-DU is collocated with the O-RU with a direct connection between the two (LLS-C1) through a cell site gateway router.

O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model: the O-DU is at a Data Centre. The O-RU’s at the cell site connect to the O-DU via a direct connection between O-RU and O-DU (LLS-C1) or intermediary Ethernet switches (LLS-C2 or LLS-C3).

Requirements

REQ-SEC-OFSP-1: The S-Plane shall support authentication and authorization of PTP nodes that communicate with other PTP nodes within Configuration LLS-C1, Configuration LLS-C2, or Configuration LLS-C3.

NOTE 1:	This ensures least privilege access to the S-Plane where authenticated and authorized PTP nodes communicate over the Open Fronthaul network.

NOTE 2:	There is no specific requirement for authentication and authorization mechanism of S-plane PTP messages.

REQ-SEC-OFSP-2: The S-Plane should provide a means to prevent spoofing of master clocks.

REQ-SEC-OFSP-3: For the O-DU at the Data Centre deployment model the S-Plane should protect against MITM attacks that degrade the clock accuracy due to packet delay attacks or selective interception and removal attacks [28].

REQ-SEC-OFSP-4: The O-DU shall be able to detect and defend against application level attacks across the S-Plane interface, due to misbehaviour or malicious intent.

REQ-SEC-OFSP-5: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism to authenticate the sender of the PTP ANNOUNCE messages.

REQ-SEC-OFSP-6: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism for integrity protection of the PTP  ANNOUNCE messages.

REQ-SEC-OFSP-7: The S-Plane should support a security mechanism for replay protection of the PTP ANNOUNCE messages.

Security Controls

Synchronization Architecture Redundancy

This clause addresses requirement REQ-SEC-OFSP-3 by providing an architectural recommendation to S-plane security based on redundancy in the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.

The following architectural recommendations for security controls build S-Plane redundancy into to the Open Fronthaul for increased robustness against security breaches.

SEC-CTL-OFSP-1: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support simultaneous Grandmasters.

SEC-CTL-OFSP-2: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture should support the assignment of GMs to physically separated PTP ports. Multiple masters could be connected to offer topology resilience.

O-RAN Synchronization Architecture and Solution Specification [30], clause 8.2.3 Timing/Synchronization Redundancy & Resiliency provides additional details on redundancy for the Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture.

Authentication and Authorization of PTP nodes

This clause addresses requirements REQ-SEC-OFSP-1 and REQ-SEC-OFSP-2 based on the use of IEEE 802.1X-2020 Port-based Network Access Control [12] for authentication and subsequent authorization of PTP nodes.

Clause 5.2.5.5 provides requirements and security controls for the authentication and authorization of S-Plane PTP nodes within Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segments.

Securing  PTP ANNOUNCE Messages using IEEE 1588 Authentication TLV

This clause provides security controls for REQ-SEC-OFSP-5 , REQ-SEC-OFSP-6, and REQ-SEC-OFSP-7 using IEEE 1588-2019 ([27]) AUTHENTICATION TLV (clause 16.14) to provide source authentication, message integrity, and replay attack protection for PTP ANNOUNCE messages within a PTP domain.

SEC-CTL-OFSP-3: The Open Fronthaul Synchronization architecture may support IEEE 1588-2019 [27] Authentication TLV for securing PTP ANNOUNCE messages.

Open Fronthaul Point-to-Point LAN Segment

Introduction

The Open Fronthaul Ethernet L1 physical interface comprises one or more coaxial cables, twisted pairs, or optical fibers. These are also known as point-to-point LAN segments [12]. Each end of the Open Fronthaul point-to-point LAN segment comprises a physical connection (colloquially known as an Ethernet Port) to physical O-RAN network elements, as described in [13] and [14].

	EXAMPLE:	Physical O-RAN network elements includes O-DU, O-RU.

An Open Fronthaul network element is an entity in a point-to-point LAN segment. Xhaul Transport Network Elements that share a point-to-point LAN segment with Open Fronthaul network elements are also Open Fronthaul network elements. Examples of O-RAN Alliance defined Open Fronthaul network elements include, but are not limited to, O-DU, O-RU, switches, FHM, FHGW, TNE and PRTC-T/GM, see [13],[14],[15] and [26].

REQ-SEC-OFHPLS-3: The Open Fronthaul shall provide a means to block access to unused Ethernet ports in an Open Fronthaul network element.

Open Fronthaul implementations may support IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] to satisfy the requirements listed above. Implementations that support optional 802.1X shall provide the security controls as specified in clause  5.2.5.5.3.

Security Controls

Solution #1: Authentication and Authorization based on 802.1X Port based Network Access Control

IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] is optional to support.

IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] Port-based Network Access Control  provides the means to control network access in point-to-point LAN segments within the Open Fronthaul network. Port-based network access control in the O-RAN Alliance Open Fronthaul comprises supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server entities described in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12]  and as further described in this clause. All other entities and functionality described in IEEE 802.1X [12] are out of scope of this O-RAN Alliance specification and are determined by vendor implementation in agreement with operator-specific requirements.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-1: Operator implementation of IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] for Open Fronthaul port-based network access control is optional to use for each point-to-point LAN segment.

Supplicants in the Open Fronthaul Network

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-2: Open Fronthaul network elements shall support IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] supplicant functionality for each port connection in the Open Fronthaul network element.

Authenticators in the Open Fronthaul Network

In IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12] a supplicant mutually authenticates with an authenticator.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-3: Any Open Fronthaul network element may be an authenticator in the Open Fronthaul network.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-4: An authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall perform port-based network access control on each point-to-point LAN segment as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-5: Port-based network access control between a supplicant and authenticator in an Open Fronthaul network shall use EAP-TLS authentication as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].

O-DU as an Authenticator

Configuration LLS-C1 [13] and Cascade Mode in the Shared Cell Concept [12] are cases where an O-DU and O-RU are Open Fronthaul network elements in a point-to-point LAN segment.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-6: In the case of Configuration LLS-C1, the O-DU shall support the authenticator functionality as defined in IEEE 802.1X-2020 [12].

Authenticator interface to an Authentication Server in the Open Fronthaul Network

IEEE 802.1X describes an EAP-TLS exchange which includes an interface between an authenticator and authentication server [12].

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-7: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server shall support IETF RADIUS standards, IETF RFC 2865 [22], IETF RFC 2866 [23], IETF RFC 3579 [24], and successor standards.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-8: The interface between an authenticator and authentication server should support IETF Diameter standards, IETF RFC 4072 [25] and successor standards.

	NOTE :	Mechanisms to secure the interface between the authenticator and authentication server are out of scope of the O-RAN Alliance.

Authentication and authorization procedure for 802.1X Port based Network Access Control

General requirements

Only those Open Fronthaul network elements acting as a supplicant that have mutually authenticated with an authenticator are authorized to participate in the Open Fronthaul network. If an authenticator port is to be activated in the Open Fronthaul, then the authenticator places the port into an unauthorized state that allows EAP over LAN (EAPOL) packets for EAP authentication and blocks all other traffic. If the mutual authentication has been successful and the operator authorizes operation for the network element port, then the port is switched to the authorized state whereby non-EAPOL packets can be sent and received.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-9: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator shall place each of its unauthorized ports into a state that allows EAPOL traffic and block all other Ethernet traffic.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-10: Open Fronthaul network elements acting as an authenticator should be able to implement authorization policies that apply to its authorized ports.

NOTE:	Authorization policies may include tagging authorized traffic with a particular VLAN-ID as it egresses the Open Fronthaul network element and/or enforcing access control policies that restrict the type of traffic able to be forwarded by the Open Fronthaul network element.

Manufacturer Install Certificates

This clause applies to the Extensible Authentication Protocol as defined in IEEE 802.1X [12].  where such an approach is used. A supplicant implements an EAP method according to its supported credentials. Prior to a supplicant enrolling in an operator’s PKI, a manufacturer installed certificate shall be used together with an EAP-TLS dialogue to enable certificate-based mutual authentication to be performed between an authenticator and a supplicant.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-11: The O-RU shall have installed a Manufacturer Installed X.509 Certificate.

Security Procedure

The following procedure describes the authentication and authorization, based on IEEE 802.1X Port based Network Access Control, of point-to-point LAN segments between a supplicant and another Open Fronthaul network element acting as an authenticator.

SEC-CTL-OFHPLS-12: The normal operation procedure defined in IEEE 802.1X [12] shown in Figure 5.2.5.5.21 shall be performed to authenticate and authorize an O-RU within an Open Fronthaul network.

Protecting Open Fronthaul messages using MACsec

Introduction

MACsec defined in the standard IEEE 802.1AE -2018[79] is a Layer 2 protocol that provides data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and authenticity of data origin including replay protection for all types of traffic on Ethernet links.

MACsec can be configured in an End-to-End mode or Hop-by-Hop mode. Hop-by-Hop mode requires the intermediate nodes to support MACsec. End-to-End mode does not require the intermediate nodes to support MACsec.
MACsec configuration can be applied per VLAN or at the base interface level.

The following clause describes the supported encryption modes for establishing MACsec.

MACsec using EDE-CC

WAN mode MACsec

LAN mode MACsec

The Open Fronthaul network element can use one of the encryption modes based on the specific Open Fronthaul traffic that requires protection.

MACsec using EDE-CC

In this mode, MACsec uses EDE-CC, controlled port, uncontrolled port as functional blocks from IEEE 802.1AE-2018 [79]. This solution applies to scenarios where MACsec is applied based on VLAN tags and configured at the VLAN interface.

This mode allows 802.1Q VLAN tags to be  encrypted inside the MACsec header and also sent  in clear text, outside the MACsec header. The inner VLAN tag  is protected by MACsec while the outer VLAN tag is used for VLAN based switching in a network where some transport network elements may not be MACsec capable. This solution enables MACsec to be configured in an end-to end tunnel mode such that the intermediate nodes may be MACsec-unaware.

To prevent intermediary nodes from consuming EAPoL packets, it is recommended to configure the group destination address as specified in IEEE 802.1AE-2018 [79], Table 15.1.

Figure 5.2.5.6.2-1 depicts the scenario where the O-RU and O-DU are connected via a switched fronthaul network and MACsec is enabled at O-DU and O-RU in an End-to-End tunnel mode. The TNE and intermediary switches may or may not support MACsec capabilities.

Figure 5.2.5.6.21 : End-to-End MACsec solution for fronthaul security protection

The O-DU functional block transmits the Open Fronthaul message that needs encryption to the controlled port, which passes through an EDE functional block. This EDE block secures the Open Fronthaul message using MACsec. The messages are filtered based on their EtherType. The EDE-CC, a variant of EDE, adds a cleartext VLAN header before the MACsec header, which includes VLAN and VLAN PCP bits, that are used for VLAN-based switching and identifying QoS profiles in the MACsec-unaware Fronthaul TNE connected to the O-DU. At the receiving endpoint, the O-RU validates the encrypted traffic received at the EDE using MACsec. Upon successful validation, it forwards the traffic via the controlled port to the O-RU functional block. Communication from the O-RU to the O-DU follows a similar process.

The O-DU functional block transmits the S-Plane messages that do not require encryption to the uncontrolled port. The S-Plane message has a specific PTP EtherType for the G.8275.1 profile. The demultiplexing operation selectively filters out PTP traffic based on its EtherType and forwards it to the uncontrolled port. As a result, PTP messages exit the hardware port unprotected by MACsec. When receiving, the O-RU maps PTP messages to the uncontrolled port based on the EtherType. Through the uncontrolled port, PTP messages are directed to the 1588 layer in the O-RU functional block.

Depending on the chosen network topology, the MACsec tunnel endpoint can be a TNE, and the functionalities of controlled, uncontrolled ports, and EDE can apply to it. Communication between the selected MACsec tunnel endpoints would occur in a similar manner.

Security Controls

This clause specifies the security controls for configuring MACsec using EDE-CC. The Open Fronthaul network elements include the O-DU, O-RU and TNE.

SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-1: The Open Fronthaul network elements may support  the functional blocks of controlled port, uncontrolled port, and Ethernet Data Encryption (EDE), as defined in the standard IEEE 802.1AE -2018 [79] clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 15.6.

SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-2: The Open Fronthaul network elements may demultiplex PTP messages identified by EtherType for G.8275.1 to the uncontrolled port that remain unprotected by MACsec.

SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-3: The Open Fronthaul network elements may forward the data that need to be encrypted to the controlled port . The controlled port then sends the data to the EDE functional block that is secured by MACsec.

SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-4:The Open Fronthaul network may support the EDE-CC functionality that allows utilization of the frame’s VLAN tag for service selection and conveyance of Priority Code Point (PCP) and drop-eligible (DEI) information.

SEC-CTL-OFHMECC-5: The Open Fronthaul network elements shall support the cipher suites, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 4.8.

WAN mode MACsec

This mode allows the 802.1Q VLAN tag to be unencrypted and sent in clear text, outside the MACsec header. This solution applies to scenarios where MACsec is applied based on VLAN tag and configured at the VLAN interface. This solution enables the intermediatory switches that are MACsec-unaware to switch the packets based on the VLAN tag.

To prevent  MACsec capable intermediary nodes from consuming EAPoL packets, it is recommended to configure the group destination address to allow the intermediatory nodes to tunnel the packets like data packets.

Security Controls

Security Events to be Logged

Introduction

During O-RAN operations, components generate many events. Some of these events have security utility and are thus termed security events. Logging these security events is critical to maintaining a secure O-RAN environment. For convenience, security event log requirements are organized by high-level categories. These categories are mapped against the following O-RAN architectural elements: SMO, O-RAN Network Functions (NF), and O-Cloud (see Table 5.3.8.11.1-1).

The SMO has security events related to management and orchestration.

O-RAN Network Functions have application security events.

O-Cloud has both network security events and system security events related to operating systems, hypervisors, and container runtimes.

The following security event types occur in all O-RAN components (SMO, O-RAN NF, and O-Cloud): account and identity event, data access events, and general security events.

SBOM Guidelines for O-RAN

SBOM Overview

This clause provides guidance for generation, delivery, and use of a software bill of materials (SBOM).

SBOM is a fundamental component of a mature Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SBOM is an industry best practice part of secure software development that enhances the understanding of the upstream software supply chain so that vulnerability notifications and updates can be properly and safely handled across the installed customer base.   The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) define SBOM as “a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.” The DoC, in coordination with NTIA, published a report “The Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)” [17] that provides guidance on the data fields, automation, and processes to be used by suppliers and customers.  The SBOM documents proprietary and third-party software, including commercial and free and open-source software (FOSS), used in software products. The SBOM is maintained and used by the software supplier and stored and viewed by the network operator.

[Intentionally blank]

REQ-SBOM-003: Vulnerabilities shall not be included as an additional data field because it would represent a static view from a specific point in time, while vulnerabilities are constantly evolving.

NOTE 1: The SBOM should be used by vendors and operators to periodically check against known vulnerability databases to identify potential risk.

NOTE 2: The level of risk for a vulnerability should be determined by the software vendor and operator with consideration of the software product, use case, and network environment.

NOTE 3: The SBOM provides visibility into the use of open-source and third-party provided software having known vulnerabilities or contributions from individuals or companies in adversarial nations, but it does not protect against zero-day vulnerabilities that were unintentionally or maliciously inserted, exploited, or discovered and not reported.

REQ-SBOM-004: SBOM depth shall be provided at top-level.

REQ-SBOM-005: SBOM depth shall be provided to a second-level for O-RAN Software Community (OSC) sourced software to indicate which OSC modules are used and which individual and/or company contributed the software for that module.

REQ-SBOM-009: SBOM for commercial software shall be access controlled.

REQ-SBOM-010: The consumer of an SBOM shall maintain confidentiality protection on the SBOM delivered from the SBOM producer.

NOTE 4:	As stated in the DoC/NTIA report [17], "…some have raised concerns that adversaries could take advantage and target those critical components for novel attacks. Further research is necessary to understand the optimal structure and incentives for sharing, protecting, and using SBOM data."

REQ-SBOM-011: The SBOM shall be provided in Software Package Data eXchange (SPDX) [18], CycloneDX [19], or Software Identification (SWID) [20] format.

NOTE 5:	ISO/IEC 5962:2021[21] - Information technology — SPDX® Specification V2.2.1, published August 2021, specifies SPDX as a standard data format for communicating the component and metadata information associated with SBOM.

Security Controls

SEC-CTL-SBOM-001: For integrity, a hash shall be generated for the SBOM, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 5.

SEC-CTL-SBOM-002: For authenticity, a digital signature shall be provided for the SBOM, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [3], clause 5.

Protecting data and information in storage

For sensitive data in (persistent or temporary) storage read access rights shall be restricted. Files of a system that are needed for the functionality shall be protected against manipulation.
In addition, the following rules apply for:
- Systems that need access to identification and authentication data in the clear, e.g. in order to perform an authentication. Such systems shall not store this data in the clear, but scramble or encrypt it by implementation-specific means.
- Systems that do not need access to sensitive data (e.g. user passwords) in the clear. Such systems shall hash this sensitive data.
- Stored files on the network product: examples for protection against manipulation are the use of checksum or cryptographic methods.

System handling during overload situations

The system shall provide security measures to deal with overload situations which may occur as a result of a denial of service attack or during periods of increased traffic or reach the congestion threshold. In particular, partial, or complete impairment of system availability shall be avoided. Potential protective measures include:
- Restricting available RAM per application.
- Restricting maximum sessions for a Web application.
- Defining the maximum size of a dataset.
- Restricting CPU resources per process.
- Prioritizing processes.
- Overload control method, e.g. limiting amount or size of transactions of a user or from an IP address in a specific time range.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.2

#26

System handling during excessive overload situations

The system shall act in a predictable way if an overload situation cannot be prevented. A system shall be built in this way that it can react on an overload situation in a controlled way. However, it is possible that a situation happens where the security measures are no longer sufficient.
In such case it shall be ensured that the system cannot reach an undefined and thus potentially insecure state. In an extreme case this means that a controlled system shutdown is preferable to uncontrolled failure of the security functions and thus loss of system protection.
The vendor shall provide a technical description of the network product's Over Load Control mechanisms (especially whether these mechanisms rely on cooperation of other network elements e.g. eNode B) and the accompanying test case for this requirement will check that the description provides sufficient detail in order for an evaluator to understand how the mechanism is designed.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.3

#27

System robustness against unexpected input

During transmission of data to a system it is necessary to validate input to the network product before processing. This includes all data which is sent to the system. Examples of this are user input, values in arrays and content in protocols. The following typical implementation error shall be avoided:
- No validation on the lengths of transferred data
- Incorrect assumptions about data formats
- No validation that received data complies with the specification
- Insufficient handling of protocol errors in received data
- Insufficient restriction on recursion when parsing complex data formats
- White listing or escaping for inputs outside the values margin

#28

Network product Software integrity validation

1) Software package integrity shall be validated in the installation/upgrade stage.
2) Network product shall support software package integrity validation via cryptographic means, e.g. digital signature. To this end, the network product has a list of public keys or certificates of authorised software sources, and uses the keys to verify that the software update is originated from only these sources.
3) Tampered software shall not be executed or installed if integrity check fails.
4) A security mechanism is required to guarantee that only authorized individuals can initiate and deploy a software update, and modify the list mentioned in bullet 2.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.3
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.3.5

#29

System functions shall not be used or accessed without successful authentication and authorization

The usage of a system function without successful authentication on basis of the user identity and at least one authentication attribute (e.g. password, certificate) shall be prevented. System functions comprise, for example network services (like SSH, SFTP, Web services), local access via a management console, local usage of operating system and applications. This requirement shall also be applied to accounts that are only used for communication between systems. An exception to the authentication and authorization requirement are functions for public use such as those for a Web server on the Internet, via which information is made available to the public.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.1.1

#30

The network product shall use accounts that allow unambiguous identification of the user

Users shall be identified unambiguously by the network product. The network product shall support assignment of individual accounts per user, where a user could be a person, or, for Machine Accounts, an application, or a system. The network product shall not enable the use of group accounts or group credentials, or sharing of the same account between several users, by default. The network product shall support a minimum number of 50 individual accounts per user data base if not explicitly specified in a SCAS of a particular network product, so that accountability for each user is ensured even in large operator networks. The network product shall not support user access credentials unrelated to an account.
NOTE: The network product may support independent user data bases for different access methods, e.g. one data base for command shell access on OS level and another data base for GUI access. User data bases may be stored locally on the network product or on a central AAA system that the network product accesses for user authentication.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.1.2

#31

Account protection by at least one authentication attribute

The various user and machine accounts on a system shall be protected from misuse. To this end, an authentication attribute is typically used, which, when combined with the user name, enables unambiguous authentication and identification of the authorized user.
Authentication attributes include:
- Cryptographic keys
- Token
- Passwords
This means that authentication based on a parameter that can be spoofed (e.g. phone numbers, public IP addresses or VPN membership) is not permitted. Exceptions are attributes that cannot be faked or spoofed by an attacker.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.2.1

#32

Predefined accounts shall be deleted or disabled

All predefined or default accounts shall be deleted or disabled. Many systems have default accounts (e.g. guest, ctxsys), some of which are preconfigured with or without known passwords. These standard users shall be deleted or disabled. Should this measure not be possible the accounts shall be locked for remote login. In any case disabled or locked accounts shall be configured with a complex password as specified in clause 4.2.3.4.3.1 Password Structure of TS 33.117. This is necessary to prevent unauthorized use of such an account in case of misconfiguration.
Exceptions to this requirement to delete or disable accounts are accounts that are used only internally on the system involved and that are required for one or more applications on the system to function. Also, for these accounts remote access or local login shall be forbidden to prevent abusive use by users of the system.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.4.1
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.2.2

#33

Predefined or default authentication attributes shall be deleted or disabled

Normally, authentication attributes such as password or cryptographic keys will be preconfigured from producer, vendor, or developer of a system. Such authentication attributes shall be changed by automatically forcing a user to change it on 1st time login to the system or the vendor provides instructions on how to manually change it.

TS 33.511 §4.2.3.4.1
TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.2.3

#34

Password Complexity rule

The setting by the vendor shall be such that a network product shall only accept passwords that comply with the following complexity criteria:
1) Absolute minimum length of 8 characters (shorter lengths shall be rejected by the network product). It shall not be possible setting this absolute minimum length to a lower value by configuration.
2) Comprising at least three of the following categories:
- at least 1 uppercase character (A-Z)
- at least 1 lowercase character (a-z)
- at least 1 digit (0-9)
- at least 1 special character (e.g. @;!$.)
The network product shall use a default minimum length of 10 characters. The minimum length of characters in the passwords shall be configurable by the operator. The default minimum length is the value configured by the vendor before any operator-specific configuration has been applied. The special characters may be categorized in sets according to their Unicode category.
The network product shall at least support passwords of a length of 64 characters or a length greater than 64 characters.
If a central system is used for user authentication, password policy is performed on the central system and additional assurance shall be provided that the central system enforces the same password complexity rules as laid down for the local system in this subclause. If a central system is not used for user authentication, the assurance on password complexity rules shall be performed on the Network Product.
When a user is changing a password or entering a new password, the system checks and ensures that it meets the password requirements. Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level,.).

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.1

#35

Password changes

If a password is used as an authentication attribute, then the system shall offer a function that enables a user to change his password at any time. When an external centralized system for user authentication is used it is possible to redirect or implement this function on this system.
Password change shall be enforced after initial login.
The system shall enforce password change based on password management policy. In particular, the system shall enforce password expiry.
Previously used passwords shall not be allowed up to a certain number (Password History).
The number of disallowed previously used passwords shall be:
- Configurable;
- Greater than 0;
- And its default value shall be 3. This means that the network product shall store at least the three previously set passwords. The maximum number of passwords that the network product can store for each user is up to the manufacturer.
When a password is about to expire a password expiry notification shall be provided to the user.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level.). An exception to this requirement is machine accounts.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.2

#36

Protection against brute force and dictionary attacks

If a password is used as an authentication attribute, a protection against brute force and dictionary attacks that hinder password guessing shall be implemented.
Brute force and dictionary attacks aim to use automated guessing to ascertain passwords for user and machine accounts. Various measures or a combination of these measures can be taken to prevent this.
The most commonly used protection measures are:
1) Using the timer delay (this delay could be the same or increased depending the operator's policy for each attempt, e.g. double the delay, or 5 minutes delay, or 10 minutes delay) for each newly entered password input following an incorrect entry ("tar pit").
2) Blocking an account following a specified number of incorrect attempts, refer to 4.2.3.4.5 of TS 33.117. However, it has to be taken into account that this solution needs a process for unlocking and an attacker can force this to deactivate accounts and make them unusable.
3) Using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attempts (often used for Web applications).
4) Using a password blacklist to prevent vulnerable passwords.
NOTE: Password management and blacklist configuration may be done in a separate node that is different to the node under test, e.g. a SSO server or any other central credential manager.
In order to achieve higher security, it is often meaningful to combine two or more of the measures named here. It is left to the vendor to select appropriate measures.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level.). An exception to this requirement is machine accounts.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.3

#37

Hiding password display

The password shall not be displayed in such a way that it could be seen and misused by a casual local observer. Typically, the individual characters of the password are replaced by a character such as "*". Under certain circumstances it may be permissible for an individual character to be displayed briefly during input. Such a function is used, for ex ample, on smartphones to make input easier. However, the entire password is never output to the display in plaintext.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g. application-level, OS-level.). An exception to this requirement is machine accounts.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.3.4

#38

Network Product Management and Maintenance interfaces

The network product management shall support mutual authentication mechanisms, the mutual authentication mechanism can rely on the protocol used for the interface itself or other means.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.4.1

#39

Policy regarding consecutive failed login attempts

a) The maximum permissible number of consecutive failed user account login attempts should be configurable by the operator. The definition of the default value set at manufacturing time for maximum number of failed user account login attempts shall be less than or equal to 8, typically 5. After the maximum permissible number of consecutive failed user account login attempts is exceeded by a user there shall be a block delay in allowing the user to attempt login again. This block delay and also the capability to set period of the block delay, e.g. double the delay, or 5 minutes delay, or 10 minutes delay, after each login failure should be configurable by the operator. The default value set at manufacturing time for this delay shall be greater than or equal to 5 sec.
b) If supported, infinite (permanent) locking of an account that has exceeded maximum permissible number of consecutive failed user account login attempts should also be possible via configuration, with the exception of administrative accounts which shall get only temporarily locked.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.5

#40

Authorization policy

The authorizations for accounts and applications shall be reduced to the minimum required for the tasks they have to perform.
Authorizations to a system shall be restricted to a level in which a user can only access data and use functions that he needs in the course of his work. Suitable authorizations shall also be assigned for access to files that are components of the operating system or of applications or that are generated by the same (e.g. configuration and logging files).
Alongside access to data, execution of applications and components shall also take place with rights that are as low as possible. Applications should not be executed with administrator or system rights.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.6.1

#41

Role-based access control

The network product shall support Role Based Access Control (RBAC). A role-based access control system uses a set of controls which determines how users interact with domains and resources. The domains could be Fault Management (FM), Performance Management (PM), System Admin. The RBAC system controls how users or groups of users are allowed access to the various domains and what type of operation they can perform, i.e. the specific operation command or command group (e.g. View, Modify, Execute).
The network product supports RBAC, in particular, for OAM privilege management for network product Management and Maintenance, including authorization of the operation for configuration data and software via the network product console interface.

TS 33.117 §4.2.3.4.6.2

#42

Protecting sessions – logout function

The system shall have a function that allows a signed in user to logout at any time. All processes under the logged in user ID shall be terminated on log out. The network product shall be able to continue to operate without interactive sessions.
Only for debugging purposes, processes under a logged in user ID may be allowed to continue to run after detaching the interactive session.

Security event logging

Security events shall be logged together with a unique system reference (e.g. host name, IP or MAC address) and the exact time the incident occurred. For each security event, the log entry shall include user name and/or timestamp and/or performed action and/or result and/or length of session and/or values exceeded and/or value reached.
IETF RFC 3871, clause 2.11.10 specifies the minimum set of security events. Each vendor shall document what security events the product logs so that it can be verified by testing.

#47

Growing (dynamic) content shall not influence system functions

Growing or dynamic content (e.g. log files, uploads) shall not influence system functions. A file system that reaches its maximum capacity shall not stop a system from operating properly. Therefore, countermeasures shall be taken such as usage of dedicated filesystems, separated from main system functions, or quotas, or at least a file system monitoring to ensure that this scenario is avoided.

Processing of ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 packets

Processing of ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 packets which are not required for operation shall be disabled on the network product. In particular, there are certain types of ICMP4 and ICMPv6 that are not used in most networks, but represent a risk.
ICMP message types which on receipt lead to responses or to configuration changes are not mentioned in this requirement, but they may be necessary to support relevant and specified networking features. Those must be documented.
Certain ICMP types are generally permitted and do not need to be specifically documented. Those are marked as "Permitted" in below table.
The network product shall not send certain ICMP types by default, but it may support the option to enable utilization of these types (e.g. for debugging).
Echo Reply can be sent by default.
In case of remote base station auto deployment, Router Advertisement can be processed.

Packet filtering

The Network Product shall provide a mechanism to filter incoming IP packets on any IP interface (see RFC 3871 for further information).
In particular the Network Product shall provide a mechanism:
1) To filter incoming IP packets on any IP interface at Network Layer .and Transport Layer of the stack ISO/OSI.
2) To allow specified actions to be taken when a filter rule matches. In particular at least the following actions should be supported:
a. Discard/Drop: the matching message is discarded; no subsequent rules are applied and no answer is sent back.
b. Accept: the matching message is accepted.
c. Account: the matching message is accounted for i.e. a counter for the rule is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones. This feature is useful to monitor traffic before its blocking.
3) To enable/disable for each rule the logging for Dropped packets, i.e. details on messages matching the rule for troubleshooting.
4) To filter on the basis of the value(s) of any portion of the protocol header.
5) To reset the accounting.
6) The Network Product shall provide a mechanism to disable/enable each defined rule.

#57

Manipulated packets that are sent to an address of the network device shall not lead to an impairment of availability

A network device shall be not affected in its availability or robustness by incoming packets, from other network element, that are manipulated or differing the norm. This means that appropriate packets shall be detected as invalid and be discarded. The process shall not be affecting the performance of the network device. This robustness shall be just as effective for a great mass of invalid packets as for individual or a small number of packets.
Examples of such packets are:
- Mass-produced TCP packets with a set SYN flag to produce half-open TCP connections (SYN flooding attack).
- Packets with the same IP sender address and IP recipient address (Land attack).
- Mass-produced ICMP packets with the broadcast address of a network as target address (Smurf attack).
- Fragmented IP packets with overlapping offset fields (Teardrop attack).
- ICMP packets that are larger than the maximum permitted size (65,535 Bytes) of IPv4 packets (Ping-of-death attack).
- Uncorrelated reply packets (i.e. packets which cannot be correlated to any request).
Sometimes the relevant behaviour of the network device will be configured. In other cases, the behaviour of the network device may only be verified by the relevant tests.

GTP-U Filtering

The following capability is conditionally required:
- For each message of a GTP-U-based protocol, it shall be possible to check whether the sender of this message is authorized to send a message pertaining to this protocol.
NOTE: The check could be performed e.g. against a whitelist or blacklist of permitted message type / sender identity combinations.
- At least the following actions should be supported when the check is satisfied:
- Discard: the matching message is discarded.
- Accept: the matching message is accepted.
- Account: the matching message is accounted for, i.e. a counter for the rule is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones. This feature is useful to monitor traffic before its blocking.
This requirement is conditional in the following sense: It is required that at least one of the following two statements holds:
- The Network Product supports the capability described above and this is stated in the product documentation.
- The Network Product's product documentation states that the capability is not supported and that the Network Product needs to be deployed together with a separate entity which provides the capability described above.
NOTE : Such a separate entity could e.g. be a GTP Firewall.
NOTE: Test cases for this separate entity are not provided in the present document, but are believed to be similar to them.
NOTE: The test cases are only applicable to all network product classes utilizing GTP-U based protocol.

Annex C (informative):
Guidance on Security Requirements & Controls

C.1 O-Cloud

Controls given in this clause are designed as a guidance and non-normative. The implementation of those non-normative controls depends on the security policies within the O-Cloud Service Provider, O-RAN  Application Provider  and Service Provider.

C.1.1 Secure protection of cryptographic keys and sensitive data

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-1

The following potential implementation options for encrypting cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the O-Cloud platform could be used. The appropriate option to be used depends on the sensitivity of the data to be protected and needs to be assessed/determined by the Service provider.

Software based:

Software-based KMS vaults supporting management of keys, including creation, rotation, and revocation, as well as encrypting and decrypting sensitive data with managed keys [51].

Use a vTPM: A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) is a software-based representation of a physical Trusted Platform Module 2.0 chip to provide secure storage of credentials or keys [54]. A vTPM acts as any other virtual device. It performs the same functions as a TPM, but it performs cryptographic coprocessor capabilities in software. It should comply with the TPM 2.0 specification [53].

Hardware based

Hardware-based key vaults: The use of Key Management Service (KMS) based on an HSM [i.5], [i.6], [52]. The data is encrypted using a data encryption key (DEK); a new DEK is generated for each encryption. The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) that is stored and managed in the HSM of the KMS provider.

A hardware TPM [i.8], [53]. For data encryption, an encryption key is stored on disk but encrypted with the TPM master key (the storage root key (SRK)). This encryption key can only be used after it was decrypted by an authenticated TPM. The actual data encryption/decryption is then done by the main CPU, only decryption/encryption of the encryption key is done inside the TPM.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-2

Overwriting with zero (e.g., /dev/zero) or simple patterns.

Overwriting with random data using:

True random data source (e.g., /dev/random). This solution takes too long to wait for the entropy generation.

Pseudorandom data source (e.g., /dev/urandom) can be used as a reasonable source of pseudorandom data.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-SS-3

Each data centre adheres to a strict disposal policy and uses the techniques described to achieve compliance with NIST SP 800-88 Revision 1 "Guidelines for Media Sanitization” [75] and DoD 5220.22-M “National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual" [50].

Potential solutions for REQ-SEC-OCLOUD-SS-5

Automatic memory scrubbing on boot:

Implement a process that automatically clears all volatile memory as early as possible during the boot sequence. This can be achieved through BIOS settings or early-stage boot loader scripts that overwrite memory with zeros or random data to ensure no residual data is left accessible.

Watchdog timers:

Use timers that watch for unexpected shutdowns or power losses. If something goes wrong, these timers help make sure memory is cleaned properly before the system starts up again.

Work with power backup systems:

For systems with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), integrate the memory scrubbing mechanism with UPS software to initiate secure shutdown procedures that include clearing volatile memory when the UPS detects a power outage and is about to run out of battery.

C.1.2 Chain of Trust

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-1

There are many ways to measure platform integrity. In many cases, a hardware security module is used to store measurement data such as a HSM and TPM. Various platform integrity technologies build their own CoTs [i.7] and listed here below:

UEFI Secure Boot (SB)

Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)

Intel Boot Guard

Intel Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR)

Intel Technology Example Summary

AMD Platform Secure Boot (AMD PSB)

Arm TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for Armv8-A

Arm Secure Boot and the Chain of Trust (CoT)

Cisco Platform Roots of Trust

IBM Chain of Trust (CoT)

For more details, see [i.7], clause 3.2.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-2

A vTPM can be considered a software-based implementation of a root of trust. It emulates the behavior and functionalities of a physical TPM through software mechanisms and cryptographic libraries [53] and [54]. A vTPM operates within a virtual machine or as a software module within an operating system, leveraging the underlying hardware and security features provided by the host system. It can perform key generation, storage, and cryptographic operations similar to a physical TPM. However, since it is implemented in software, its security relies on the host system's security measures and may be more vulnerable to compromise if the host system is compromised. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the overall security of the O-Cloud where the vTPM is deployed and to consider additional security measures to protect the software root of trust.

Potential solutions for SEC-CTL-OCLOUD-COT-3

Please refer to the following technology examples in [i.7], clause 6.1 for more information:

Intel Security Libraries for the Data Center (ISecL-DC)

Remote AS - Project Veraison (VERificAtIon of atteStatiON)

IBM Platform Attestation Tooling

Relevant information on the Attestation Server is provided in [i.7], clause 6.1 and [44], clause 6.6.

The following figure C.1.2-1 shows an example of remote AS:

Figure C.1.21 : Example of Remote AS

The AS from the hardware layer to the O-RAN Application includes the following steps (see figure C.1.2-1):

Attestation of the O-Cloud platform

RoT measures and verifies hardware resources (server platform) including firmware/BIOS. It then launches the hardware resources.

The server act as the attester of the OS/virtualization layer. It measures, verifies, and launches the OS/virtualization layer.

The attestation results and corresponding measurements are maintained by the management platform (e.g. Kubernetes) acting as the trust agent.

Attestation of Application

The attestation process is initiated by the management platform requesting to instantiate a new Application:

The virtualization layer verifies the virtual instance.

Virtualized RoT (vRoT) measures the Application. The vRoT is a virtual instance associated to the hardware protected RoT. The virtualization layer provides this virtual resource to the virtual instance.

Corresponding measurements are reported to the trust agent. The trust agent exposes the attestation results to authorized attestation server (could be within the SMO) so that it verifies collected measurements against trust policies already defined by administrators.

C.2 Common Application Lifecycle Management
