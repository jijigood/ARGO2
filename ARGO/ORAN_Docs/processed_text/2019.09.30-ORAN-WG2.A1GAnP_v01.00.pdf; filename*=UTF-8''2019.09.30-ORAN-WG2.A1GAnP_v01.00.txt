2.1 A1 Architecture 11
2.1.1 General 12
The O-RAN architecture includes a non-Real Time (RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and a near-RT RIC which 13
are connected through the A1 interface. 14
near-RT RIC
non-RT RIC
A1
 15
Figure 2-1: A1 is the interface between the non-RT RIC and the near-RT RIC. 16
2.1.2 Role of A1 in the O-RAN Architecture 17
The non-RT RIC function resides in the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) layer of the O-RAN OAM 18
architecture [5] that also handles deployment and configuration as well as data collection of e.g. RAN observables. 19
In the SMO layer there also resides functions that handle AI/ML workflow, e.g. training and update of ML Models, as 20
well as functions for deployment of ML models and other applications [3]. 21
The SMO Layer may also have access to data other than that available in the RAN network functions and this 22
enrichment information can be used to enhance the RAN guidance and optimization functions.  23
One purpose of the SMO layer is to optimize the RAN performance towards fulfilmen t of the SLAs in the RAN intent. 24
The purpose of the A1 interface is to enable the non-RT RIC function to provide policy-based guidance, ML model 25
management and enrichment information to the near-RT RIC function so that the RAN can optimize e.g. RRM under 26
certain conditions. 27

as an O-CU-CP, an O-CU-UP, an O-DU or an eNB. 3
2.1.3 A1 service architecture 4
2.1.3.1 A1 Policy Management Service 5
Based on high level directives (goals for the system) expressed in RAN Intent, and on observables (events and counters) 6
provided over O1, the non-RT RIC defines polices that are provided to the near-RT RIC over the A1 interface. The 7
purpose of the A1 policies is to guide the RAN performance towards the overall goal expressed in RAN Intent. The A1 8
policies are declarative polices that contain statements on policy objectives and policy resources applicable to UEs and 9
cells. 10
The non-RT RIC manages the A1 policies based on A1 policy feedback, and on the network status provided over O1. 11
The non-RT RIC uses the O1 observables to continuously evaluate the impact of the A1 policies towards fulfillment of 12
the RAN Intent and will based on internal conditions decide to issue/update the directives expressed in the A1 policies.  13
The near-RT RIC functions based on its internal functions or applications, the configuration received over O1 and the 14
temporary policies received over A1. The A1 policies do not survive a re-start of the near-RT RIC.  15
To support the policy enforcement in the near-RT RIC, the non-RT RIC can provide enrichment information over the 16
A1 interface. 17
2.1.3.2 A1 ML Model Management Service 18
ML models can be trained and executed in different places in the O-RAN architecture. Two scenarios described in [3] 19
that involves the non-RT RIC are: 20
Scenario 1.1: ML model is trained in the SMO layer and then used by the non -RT RIC to improve the monitoring 21
and guidance of the RAN based on the O1 observability. The training and the deployment of the ML Model is 22

                9
handled by SMO internal functions. The training data is the same as the data the non -RT RIC will use for inference, 1
i.e. the O1 observability. 2
Scenario 1.2: ML model is trained in the SMO layer and then used by the near-RT RIC to improve the optimization 3
of the RAN. The training of the ML Model is handled by SMO internal functions. The input data for training is the 4
same as the input data the near-RT RIC will use for inference. The trained ML Model is deployed by the SMO layer 5
via the O1 interface. The performance evaluation resulting from the execution of the ML model, and the handling of 6
explicit feedback from the ML model itself, is based on O1 observability. 7
To support the ML model inference in the near-RT RIC, the non-RT RIC can provide enrichment information over the 8
A1 interface.  9
2.1.3.3 A1 Enrichment Information Service 10
The SMO layer may have access to information from RAN-external sources that could be beneficial for near-RT RIC 11
internal functions or applications, e.g. an ML model, to improve its RAN optimization performance. This can be 12
provided as enrichment information over the A1 interface, either as external data or as inferred data (after analysis).  13
2.2 A1 interface general principles 14
The general principles for the specification of the A1 interface are as follows: 15
- the A1 interface is an open logical interface within O-RAN architecture between the non-RT RIC functionality 16
in the Orchestration & Automation layer and the near-RT RIC functionality in RAN; 17
-  the A1 interface enables a multi-vendor environment and is independent of specific implementations of the 18
Orchestration & Automation layer, non-RT RIC, and near-RT RIC; 19
-  the A1 interface enables policy-based guidance (objective, resource) of radio resource management internal 20
functions or applications that are part of near-RT RIC; 21
-  the A1 interface can provide basic feedback mechanism from near-RT RIC that enables non-RT RIC to monitor 22
the use of policies; 23
-  the policy enforcement service in near-RT RIC requires that the policies transferred over A1 interface are 24
expressed using a standardized mechanism (language, syntax, …); 25
-  the A1 interface enables transmission of enrichment information from non-RT RIC to near-RT RIC as needed by 26
the internal functions or applications in near-RT RIC; 27
-  the A1 interface is defined in an extensible way that enables new information for new functions to be added 28
without needing to change the protocol or the procedures; 29
-  A1 policies are created, modified and deleted by the non-RT RIC; 30
-  the A1 policies are enforced until deleted. It is the responsibility of non-RT RIC to create and delete policies 31
based on context information e.g., observability from RAN indicating RAN intent fulfi llment received over O1. 32
It is the responsibility of near-RT RIC to stop enforcing policies.  33
2.3 A1 interface specification objectives 34
The A1 interface specification facilitates the following: 35

Agreement in the Annex.
                10
- inter-connection of non-RT RIC functionality in the Orchestration & Automation domain with near-RT RIC 1
functionality in the Radio Access Network supplied by different manufacturers; 2
-  provide policies for individual UEs or groups of UEs; 3
- provide basic feedback on policy state from near-RT RIC that enables non-RT RIC to monitor the use of 4
policies; 5
-  provide enrichment information as required by near-RT RIC. 6
2.4 A1 interface capabilities 7
The A1 interface supports [2,3]: 8
- Transfer of policy management information from non-RT RIC to near-RT RIC; 9
- Policy feedback from near-RT RIC to non-RT RIC; 10
- Transfer of enrichment information from non-RT RIC to near-RT RIC. 11
Chapter 3 Functions of the A1 interface 12
3.1 Policy management 13
3.1.1 Introduction 14
The purpose of A1 policies is to enable the non-RT RIC function in the O&A layer to guide the near-RT RIC function, 15
and hence the RAN, towards a better fulfilment of the RAN intent. 16
NOTE: RAN Intent represents e.g. the SLA from the BSS (Business Support System) that the RAN is to fulfil for 17
all users or for a subset of users (e.g. QCI or slice). Based on the permanent configuration and the available 18
resources, the RAN strives to deliver the expected QoS for the users. 19
By utilizing the observability over O1, and the A1 policy feedback, the non-RT RIC can conclude that the RAN Intent 20
is not achieved. The non-RT RIC can then decide to use A1 policies that enable the near-RT RIC to e.g. optimize RRM 21
for a single UEs or for group of UEs. 22
E.g.: When the non-RT RIC understands that the available resources in a certain area are not enough to fulfil the 23
SLA for all users in a slice, it can then decide to temporarily change the QoS targets for some users (dynamic group 24
of users) belonging to the same slice (pre-defined group of users). 25
3.1.2 The policy management function 26
The policy management function is used by the non-RT RIC to provision and manage A1 policies that are enforced by 27
the near-RT RIC. The non-RT RIC is responsible for definition and administration of A1 polices. 28
The function is used to create, update and delete A1 policies in the near-RT RIC. 29
The function is used to query the presence, content and run-time status of an A1 policy in the near-RT RIC.  30

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Agreement in the Annex.
                11
The function is supported by A1 policy feedback from the near-RT RIC to the non-RT RIC.  1
NOTE 1: As the near-RT RIC cannot change the content of a policy, only a change in enforcement status can be 2
notified. I.e. if context is changed in such a way that a policy cannot be enforced by the near -RT RIC, the non-RT 3
RIC is notified and may decide to delete the policy. 4
NOTE 2: Feedback on the fulfilment of A1 policies in the near-RT RIC is not transferred over the A1 interface. The 5
non-RT RIC can estimate the fulfilment of A1 policies based on O1 observables.  6
NOTE 3: Before and after the creation of an A1 policy, the non-RT RIC will monitor the network to understand the 7
effect of the A1 policy on performance. Performance monitoring or tracing is not handled over the A1 interface.  8
3.1.3 Life cycle aspects of A1 policies 9
Per default, the near-RT RIC controls the RAN based on the persistent configuration. The RAN operation can be 10
optimized using A1 polices that, compared to the persistent configuration,  11
- is not critical to traffic; 12
- have temporary validity; 13
- handle individual UE or dynamically defined groups of UEs; 14
- acts within and takes precedence over the configuration; 15
- is non-persistent, i.e. does not survive a restart of the near-RT RIC. 16
An A1 policy exist in the near-RT RIC after it has been created by the non-RT RIC using the A1 Create policy 17
procedure and accepted by the near-RT RIC.  18
For an A1 policy, the near-RT RIC can provide basic policy feedback to the non-RT RIC using notifications containing 19
information on enforcement status and causes. 20
The near-RT RIC continuously evaluates the policy conditions versus the environment and notifies the non -RT RIC in 21
case the policy cannot be enforced or in case the environment changes so that the policy can be enforced.  22
NOTE: When a created A1 policy is accepted, it is assumed to be enforced until near-RT RIC notifies that it 23
cannot be enforced. 24
An A1 policy can be updated by the non-RT RIC using the A1 Update policy procedure. After the update, the policy is 25
evaluated and enforced by the near-RT RIC based on the updated policy statements. 26
An A1 policy exists in the near-RT RIC until it is deleted by the non-RT RIC using the A1 Delete policy procedure.  27
3.1.4 Identification and scope of A1 policies 28
An A1 policy is identified by a PolicyID that is assigned by non-RT RIC. The PolicyID is locally unique within non-RT 29
RIC and sent in the policy request operations that carry representations of A1 policies.  30
A1 policies consist of a scope identifier and one or more policy statements. The scope identifier represents what the 31
policy statements are to be applied on (e.g. UEs, QoS flows, or cells). The policy statements represent the directives to 32
the near-RT RIC and covers policy objectives and policy resources. 33

Figure 3-1: Illustration of the structure of an A1 policy 2
By including policy statements with policy objectives, the quality of experience can be optimized for UEs or QoS flows 3
that are identified either explicitly by a UE identifier or implicitly by a group identifier from which the near-RT RIC 4
can deduce a set of UE identifiers and QoS flow identifiers. The group identifier defines associated UEs using SPID or 5
S-NSSAI, or associated QoS Flows using S-NSSAI or 5QI. 6
By including policy statements with policy resources, UEs can e.g. be made to avoid certain cells or the radio network 7
can be optimized in specific areas e.g. regarding energy efficiency. 8
The remaining part of this sub-section describes the identifers that can be used as scope identifier in A1 policies. The 9
scope identifier can be composed by a single or a by a combination of these as is further detailed in the A1 Application 10
Protocol specification [12]. 11
3.1.4.1 Identification of UEs 12
In the scope of A1 policies, a UE is identified by a UE identifier (UEId). The UEId identifies a logi cal UE entity that is 13
known to the RAN and measurements related to it. It does not identify any hardware equipment or user subscription.  14
UEId is used for correlating O1-PM data with service targets and enables evaluation of the fulfillment of policies. In 15
order to be able to utilize non-RAN data for the usage of A1 polices, non-RAN data need to include identifiers that can 16
be correlated with UEIds by the non-RT RIC. 17
The UEId is based on the RAN UE Id defined in the 3GPP specifications for the E1 interface [ 6] and the F1 interface 18
[7]. 19
If the non-RT RIC needs to express policies for a dynamically defined group of UEs (i.e. a set of UEs), it is done  20
through a set of policies for individual UEs.  21
3.1.4.2 Identification of groups of UEs 22
In the scope of A1 policies, a pre-defined group of UEs can be implicitly identified based on a UE group identifier.  23
The following UE group identifiers are possible: 24
- SPID [8]. 25
When the near-RT RIC receives a UE group identifier in an A1 policy, it may resolve it into a set of UEids that are 26
present in the nodes controlled by the near-RT RIC and applies the policy statements to each one of the UEs.  27
A group of UEs can also be identified by using a slice identifier or an application group identifier below.  28

3.1.4.3 Identification of slices 1
In the scope of A1 policies, the following identifiers can be used to implicitly identify a pre-defined group of UEs or a 2
group of QoS flows: 3
- S-NSSAI [9]; 4
When the near-RT RIC receives a slice identifier in an A1 policy, it may resolve it into a set of UE identifiers and a set 5
of QoS flow identifiers that are present in the nodes controlled by the near-RT RIC and applies the policy statements to 6
each one of the UEs or the QoS flows. 7
3.1.4.4 Identification of applications 8
In the scope of A1 policies, the following identifiers can be used to implicitly identify a group of applications as well as 9
group of UEs: 10
- 5QI [9]; 11
When the near-RT RIC receives an application group identifier in an A1 policy, it may resolve it into a set of QoS flow 12
identifiers (that are related to the applications that the non-RT RIC is intending to optimize) and the set of UEIds (that 13
are present in the nodes controlled by the near-RT RIC) for which they apply. Then it applies the policy statements to 14
each one of the UEs and QoS flows. 15
3.1.4.5 Identification of cells 16
In the scope of A1 policies, a part of the radio network can be identified based on a cell identifier (CellID). 17
The following cell identifiers are possible: 18
- CellId [10]; 19
When the scope identifier in an A1 policy is a cell identifier, the policy statement may contain policy resources and the 20
policy implicitly has impact on all UEs handled by the specified cell(s). 21
If the non-RT RIC needs to express policies for a group of cells (i.e. a set of cells), it is done through a set of policies 22
for individual cells.  23
A policy can be applied to all cells (handled by the near-RT RIC) by setting a special value of the CellId. 24
3.1.5 A1 policy content 25
In addition to a scope identifier, an A1 policy contains policy statements. There are several kinds of policy statements 26
that cover policy objectives and policy resources. 27
NOTE: The detailed rules for how to formulate policy statements, and which combinations of identifiers and 28
statements that are allowed, are specified in [A12]. 29
3.1.5.1 Policy objectives 30
The following types of policy objectives are defined: 31

[12]. 5
3.1.5.1.3 KQI targets 6
KQI targets are expressed using KQI attributes defined in [14]. Applicable KQI attributes are defined in [12]. 7
3.1.5.1.4 KPI targets 8
KPI targets are expressed using KPI attributes defined in [15]. Applicable KPI attributes are defined in [12]. 9
3.1.5.2 Policy resources 10
The following types of policy resources are defined: 11
3.1.5.2.1 Traffic steering preferences 12
Traffic steering preference attributes [12] are used to select cell for a connection, or schedule traffic on available cells, 13
in a different way than what would be done through default behaviour.  14
3.1.5.2.2 System efficiency 15
System efficiency attributes [12] are used to optimize RAN resources in cells and nodes. 16
Chapter 4 Signalling procedures of the A1 interface 17
The procedures listed in this chapter are defined in detail in the A1 Application Protocol specification [12].  18

Annex 1
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O -RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER AGREES TO 2
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.   3
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O-RAN Alliance and 4
the entity that download s, uses or otherwise accesses any O -RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the 5
“Adopter”). 6
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification. 7
 8
SECTION 1:  DEFINITIONS 9
 10
1.1  “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or  indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common 11
control with another entity, so long as such control exists.  For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means 12
beneficial ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity. 13
1.2  “Compliant Portion” means only those specific portions of products (hardware, software or 14
combinations thereof) that implement any O-RAN Specification. 15
1.3   “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Cont ributors, 16
including their Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications. 17
1.4  “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O -RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance 18
that does not add any significant new features o r functionality and remains interoperable with the prior 19
version of an O-RAN Specification.  The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates. 20
1.5  “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other 21
than design patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise 22
licensable by a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or 23
Academic Contributorship; (ii) such Member, Cont ributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a 24
license without the payment of consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by 25
implementation of a Final Specification (without considering any Contributions not included in th e Final 26
Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) 27
grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the date 28
any Final Specification was published by the O -RAN Alliance or the date the patent claim first came into 29
existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate an 30
implementation which complies with a Final Specification without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of 31
doubt in exceptional cases where a Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of 32
which infringe patent claims, all such patent claims shall be considered Necessary Claims. 33
1.6  “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, 34
Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in 35
their license a term allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent 36
infringement suit against the licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their 37
Affiliates. 38
