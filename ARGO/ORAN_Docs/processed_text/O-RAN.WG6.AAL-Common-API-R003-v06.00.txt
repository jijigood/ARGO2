Overview
General
The AAL General Aspects and Principles are described in [2] and the AAL architecture including the AAL interfaces are depicted in the (reference GAnP architecture figure number)
The AAL interface has two parts:
AALI-C: A profile independent set of functions between AAL Application(s) and underlying AAL Implementation(s) including management and orchestration within an O-Cloud platform.
AALI-P: A set of profile specific interfaces dependent upon the profile selected e.g., FEC.
The AALI-P are addressed in FEC[8] and High-Phy specifications [9].
Within the AALI-C interface there are two parts:
AALI-C-Mgmt: Common administrative operations, actions, and events between the O-Cloud IMS and the HW Accelerator Manager (HAM). The IMS provides the O2 interface towards the SMO. The HAM terminates the AALI-C-Mgmt interface.
AALI-C-App: Common operations/actions/events toward an AAL Application. These operations are between the AAL Implementation and the AAL Application (AAL-App).
The present document details the list of AALI-C operations and events, description with input/outputs, information models, object models, state transition diagrams and requirements to implement an AAL interface.
Note: The scope of the definition in this specification is between the O-Cloud IMS and the HW Accelerator Manager (HAM) as well as between the AAL Implementation and the AAL Application, while reference to SMO is made to set the context, the normative definition of the exchange of information between the IMS and SMO, is part of the O2 IMS specification. [6]
2.2 Document Structure
This present document is structured as follows:
Chapter 2 presents the overview and main purpose of this specification.
Chapter 3 presents a list of requirements and object model.
Chapter 4 presents the initialization and flow, operations and events associated with AALI-C-Mgmt.
Chapter 5 presents the initialization and flow, operations and events associated with AALI-C-App.
AAL Common requirements and Object Model
3.1 AALI-C Mgmt Requirements
Table 3.1-1: AAL-C-Mgmt Requirements
3.2 AALI-C App Requirements
Table 3.2-1: AAL-C-App Requirements
3.2.1 AALI-C-APP Transport Abstraction Requirements and Operations
The transport between an AAL Application and an AAL Implementation can be of different types (e.g., based on shared memory, PCIe interconnect, over Ethernet). AALI-C-App shall support abstraction of these various transport mechanisms between an AAL Application and an AAL Implementation through a set of common transport APIs, constituting a transport abstraction framework. The related set of requirements and operations defined in the table below is complementing Sec. 2.5.1.12 of AAL GAnP Spec. [Ref. [7]]
Table 3.2.1-1: AAL-C-App Transport Requirements
3.3 AAL Information Model
3.3.1 Overview
The AALI-C-Mgmt interface is the management interface that is used by the IMS for administrative operations/actions/events. The HAM terminates the AALI-C-Mgmt interface.
Operations and actions/events via AALI-C-Mgmt are applicable on the following entities:
HW Accelerator
AAL Logical Processing Unit (AAL-LPU)
AAL Profile
The AALI-C-App interface is exposed by the AAL Implementation and is used by the AAL Application to discover, configure, and manage the AAL-Profile-Instance(s) and AAL-Profile-Queue(s) in the AAL-LPU assigned to the AAL Application.
Note: An AAL Application may choose to use one or more AAL Profiles as part of its implementation.
Operations and actions/events via AALI-C-App are applicable on the following entities:
AAL Logical Processing Unit (AAL-LPU)
AAL Profile Instance
AAL Profile Queue
Figure 3.3-1: Physical and Logical resources
Note: The definition of these entities are defined in GAnP specification [7] section 1.3: The cardinality and relationship between these entities are derived from the GAnP specification [7] section 2.3. The various scenarios supported are also available in the GAnP [7] section 5.
The Information model defined in [6] will be used to define these Managed Resources.
Note 1: Usage of  'M', 'O', and 'CM' imply Mandatory, Optional and Conditional Mandatory in the spec

3.3.4.2 Model Conventions
The conventions for the development of the Information Model are derived from the following sources:
3GPP TS 32.156 [1] provides the basis of the Class definitions for modeling elements that also includes the Stereotypes to be used when defining Classes. 3GPP TS 32.156 also includes the descriptions in clause 5.2.1.1 of the 3GPP standard Class attribute properties.
OAS 3.0 Specification [2] provides the basis for the Information Model data types. The Swagger documentation provides additional descriptions for the Class Attribute properties.

Table 4.1-1: AAL-C-Mgmt operations and events
4.2 AALI-C-Mgmt use case workflows
4.2.1 HW Accelerator installation/bootstrap use case workflow
This use case describes the procedure with a focus on the interaction of IMS with the HAM when installing and optionally configuring the HW Accelerator resource and configuring the AAL-LPUs resources. This procedure would be applicable during the initial deployment of an O-Cloud and afterward to reconfigure or add new resources.
This AAL UC flow can be executed during the O-Cloud Registration and Initialization Use Case, O-Cloud Inventory Update Use Case and the Hardware Infrastructure Scaling of O-Cloud Post Deployment Use Case [ Ref[5]: 3.1.3 “O-Cloud Registration and Initialization Use Case”, Configure AAL-LPU  “3.1.4 : O-Cloud Inventory Update Use Case (DMS Example)” and “3.1.5: Hardware Infrastructure Scaling of O-Cloud Post Deployment”].

4.2.2 end-2end Life Cycle Management use case workflow (Informational)
Note: The e2e flow depicted in this section are known to be incomplete and are being provided as informational guidance to implementors on how the APIs documented in the remainder of the specification are to be used. These exchanges will be made normative in future versions of the specification.
This use case describes the end-to-end procedure with a focus on the interaction between the IMS and the  HAM via the AALI-C-Mgmt interface for discovering the capabilities of the HW Accelerator, configuring the AAL-LPUs, instantiating an AAL application and optionally updating/reconfiguring the resources based on the needs of the AAL application. The flow also shows the interaction with the AAL Application via the AALI-C-App to create an AAL-Profile-Instance.
This AAL UC flow can be executed during the O-Cloud Registration and Initialization Use Case, O-Cloud Inventory Update Use Case and the Hardware Infrastructure Scaling of O-Cloud Post Deployment Use Case [ Ref[5]: 3.1.3 “O-Cloud Registration and Initialization Use Case”, Configure AAL-LPU  “3.1.4 : O-Cloud Inventory Update Use Case (DMS Example)” and “3.1.5: Hardware Infrastructure Scaling of O-Cloud Post Deployment”]. This use case is also related to the “3.2.1	Instantiate Network Function on O-Cloud”.

4.2.3 HW Accelerator Manager (HAM) registration use case workflow
The HAM registration procedure makes the HAM known to the IMS.
This use case describes how the HAM registers itself with the IMS using the AALI-C-Mgmt API. This registration at the minimum includes the HAM end point for the IMS to communicate with the HAM.
Following successful registration with the IMS, the HAM can participate in other resource management and AALI-C-Mgmt procedures.
Until successfully registered with an IMS, the HAM cannot accept management requests or provide notifications not associated with the IMS registration procedure.
Note: Installation and configuration of the HAM are not in the scope of this use case. How the HAM is configured with the IMS service endpoint and the local HAM service endpoint are implementation specific.

Note: While this list provides the details of parameters between IMS and HAM, further analysis is needed to understand what is needed by the SMO.
4.3.1.4 setAalAccelConfig
Description: This is used to configure the HW Accelerator and AAL-LPU. The operation’s input parameters are the full configuration set of parameters for the HW Accelerator and contained AAL-LPUs. These input parameters replace the existing configuration of the HW Accelerator and AAL-LPUs. The HAM shall determine the changes to be applied to the HW Accelerator based on the input parameters contained in the operation and the current configuration parameters associated with the HW Accelerator. For example, if the operation contains an AAL-LPU instance that is part of the current configuration, the HAM adds the AAL-LPU instance to the current configuration. Likewise, if the current configuration has a configured AAL-LPU that is not contained within the input parameters of this operation, the HAM deletes the AAL-LPU from the current configuration of the HW Accelerator. The HAM shall validate the state of the HW Accelerator and AAL-LPUs prior to applying the changes.
Pre-conditions:
HW Accelerator Device is initialized, and HAM is operational.
HW Accelerator Device and AAL-LPUs are in the correct state prior to performing configuration changes.
Triggers: On demand request via AALI-C-Mgmt interface
Frequency: N/A

4.3.1.5 startAalLpu
Description: This operation will start an AAL-LPU that is in the stopped state. The AAL-LPU is instantiated using the SW/FW image(s) and configuration that were provided in the setAalAccelConfig procedure.
The AAL-LPU state machine is moved to a started state. When the AAL-LPU is in the started state it is ready to be used by the AAL Application.
After successfully starting AAL-LPU using this procedure, the AAL-LPU can be stopped.
Pre-conditions: HW Accelerator Device is initialized, and HAM is operational. The AAL-LPU has been successfully configured and is in the stopped state.
Triggers: On demand request via AALI-C-Mgmt interface

4.3.1.6 stopAalLpu
Description: Moves AAL-LPU state machine to a stopped state.
AAL-LPU service is stopped. Configuration changes on the AAL-LPU can be performed. Re-configuration of the AAL-LPU compute / memory resource partitioning can be performed. Drivers can be updated / re-installed and configured. Maintenance / debugging operations can be performed.
After successfully stopping the AAL-LPU, the AAL-LPU can be (re-)configured, started or deleted.
Pre-conditions: HW Accelerator Device is initialized, and HAM is operational. The number of AAL-LPUs has been set on the HW Accelerator. The AAL-LPU has been successfully configured and is started. AAL Applications have previously been migrated off the AAL-LPU.

4.3.1.7 Inventory Notifications
Description: Inventory notifications are sent by the HAM to the IMS when the HAM discovers that O-Cloud Resources have been added, modified, or removed from the HAM’s inventory of O-Cloud Resources.  Inventory notifications are not used to report administrative or operational state changes in the resources (e.g., restarts, configuration changes that do not include added or deleted O-Cloud Resources). The Inventory Notification services in this section, provide the ability for the IMS to receive inventory notification events when O-Cloud Resources have been added, modified or removed from the HAM.
The modification of an O-Cloud Resource differs from addition and removal of a O-Cloud Resource. Examples of modifications of an O-Cloud Resource that causes an Inventory Notification event to be emitted by the HAM would be the modification of the path to the image for an AAL-LPU or the modification of the compute resources assigned to the AAL-LPU. Future releases of this specification will define which writeable attributes of O-Cloud Resources will emit an AAL Inventory event when the attribute is modified.
4.3.1.7.1 aalInventoryNotification
Description: The HW Accelerator Manager emits notifications to the IMS. The 4.2.1 HW Accelerator installation/bootstrap use case workflow, 4.2.2 end-2end Life Cycle Management use case workflow (Informational) provide examples of when the inventory notification is sent by the HAM to the IMS that has previously subscribed to receive the notification event.
Pre-conditions: The HAM is operational.  The IMS and the HAM have established connectivity.
Triggers: On demand request via AALI-C-Mgmt interface.
Frequency: Infrequent

4.3.1.8 setAalAccelIdentifier
Description: This is used to provide the HW Accelerator with its resource identifier (hw_accel_id) assigned by the IMS. The HAM uses the vendor, model, and serial_number input parameters to identify the HW Accelerator and then assigns the resource identifier to the HW Accelerator.
Pre-conditions: HW Accelerator has been discovered but needs its identifier assigned by the IMS, and HAM is operational.
Triggers: On demand request via AALI-C-Mgmt interface

4.3.2.1 Fault Service Operations
The AALI-C-Mgmt API provides operations to query the current Fault conditions for resources and raise event notifications to subscribed entities when Fault conditions occur. These Fault conditions are operational conditions of the managed resource and can be retrieved from the “faults” attribute of the associated resource.
The HAM provides the capability to query the current Fault conditions for the HW Accelerator and AAL-LPU(s).

4.3.2.2 Fault Notifications
The HW Accelerator Manager (HAM) provides the capability to subscribe to receive Fault conditions for the HW Accelerator and AAL-LPU(s) that it is managing. This capability is managed within the O-Cloud through the subscription_id identifier.
4.3.2.2.1 Subscription_id
The subscription_id is an identifier used to describe the fault notification relationship between the IMS and a given HAM; it applies indirectly to the notification of faults from all the HW Accelerators that the HAM is managing.
The subscription_id includes a list of all the faults that the IMS needs to be notified in the event of their occurrence in any one of the HW Accelerators that is being managed by the HAM.
The validity and duration of the subscription_id shall be defined by the following:
The existence and validity of the IMS to HAM relationship. For example, if the HAM needs to be updated or modified then a new subscription_id needs to be issued by the IMS.
The existence and validity of any of the HW Accelerators for which the HAM is responsible for and is managing for the IMS. If any one of these HW Accelerators requires an update, upgrade, or any other modification is performed then the subscription_id between the IMS and the given HAM needs to be renewed.  Any notification that the HAM issues to the IMS pertaining to a modification in the state or operation of the HW Accelerator by the HAM shall result in an update/renewal of the subscription_id with the IMS.
In the case of restart or power-cycles in the HW Accelerator managed by the HAM the subscription_id doesn't have to be renewed since restart or power-cycle does not alter the faults supported by the HW Accelerator or the fault formats.
If the IMS receives a fault notification from a HAM that includes a subscription_id that does not match a subscription_id maintained by the IMS for that given HAM, the IMS the IMS shall then delete that subscription by calling the deleteAalFaultSubscription API with the subscription_id followed by calling the createAalFaultSubscription API with new subscription_id(s) to (re-)create a new fault subscription.

AALI-C-APP
5.1 AALI-C-App Identification & Representation
Within the AAL Application's  process address space each, AAL-LPU can be represented by a generalized object handle (i.e., aal_lpu_handle) provided by the AAL implementation in order for the AAL Application to use the capabilities of the AAL-LPU.
Before the AALI-C-App interface can be used, the AAL implementation must be initialized by the AAL Application. The initialization of the AAL implementation allows for initialization, setup and discovery routines that are specific to an implementation. Where needed, the initialization of the AAL implementation also allows the AAL Application to inform the AAL implementation what O-Cloud Resources and associated attributes that the DMS has assigned to and can be used by the AAL Application. As an example, the DMS may inform the AAL Application about the AAL Application’s assigned O-Cloud Resource using environment variables that identify the O-Cloud Resource and associated attributes within the POD/container/VM. The identification of these O-Cloud Resources are to be shared with the AAL implementation by the AAL Application through the AALI-C-App initialization operation.
Depending on the HW design and implementation choice, an AAL-LPU implementation may want to accelerate multiple AAL Profiles, offer support for sharing HW Accelerator resources between multiple threads and/or partition AAL-LPU resources between multiple cells. For this reason, the AAL-Profile-Instance and AAL Profile Queue logical managed resources can optionally be used by the AAL Application to
distinguish between multiple supported AAL profiles per AAL-LPU
prioritize access to AAL-LPU resources
group operation requests
partition AAL-LPU resources
allow parallel access through the AAL Application interface for multiple threads / cores
As a logical managed resources, an AAL Profile Queue does not reflect a HW design specification or requirement but an AAL interface specification.
The AALI-C-App configuration is done on a per AAL-LPU basis. That is, for each AAL-LPU that is assigned to the AAL Application, the AAL Implementation exposes the AALI-C-App to the AAL Application  to initialize and configure each AAL-Profile-Instance and AAL-Profile-Queue.
5.2 AALI-C-App operations and events
The below table lists the operations and events as part of the AALI-C-App interface.
Table 5.2-1: AAL-C-App operations and events
Editor’s note: Use of AAL-Profile-Queue operations for user plane data transfer and buffer API operations needs to be clarified.

5.3.3 AALI-C-Transport API Sequence
The AALI-C-App Transport API sequence is divided into two sets of call flows in the following subsections:
Sec. 5.3.3.1 focusses on call flows related to allocation of buffers(s) to be used with other AALI-C-App Transport APIs.
Sec. 5.3.3.2 and its subsections focus on call flows detailing the various procedures for sending and receiving buffer(s) using AALI-C-App Transport API.
5.3.3.1 Allocation of AAL Buffer(s)
The AALI-C-App Transport API supports allocation of buffers from either pre-created buffer pool(s) or from memory not mapped to pre-created buffer pool(s). Send buffer(s) are allocated by the AAL Application, while Receive buffer(s) are allocated either by the AAL Application or by the AAL Implementation.
.

Table 5.4.1.2-3: cleanupAal Output Parameters
5.4.1.3 getAalLpuInfo
Description: An AAL Application queries the handle and capabilities of the AAL-LPU(s) assigned to the AAL Application. AAL-LPUs may provide different capabilities such as different AAL Profiles can be supported by the AAL-LPUs that includes different types of AAL-Profile-Instances and AAL-Profile-Queue(s). The aal-lpu-handle is unique between the AAL Application and the AAL-LPUs assigned to the AAL Application. The aal-lpu-handle is generated by the AAL Implementation.
Pre-conditions: AAL Application has at least one AAL-LPU assigned and available for use.
Triggers: On demand request from the AAL Application
Frequency: AAL Application Initialization time.

Table 5.4.1.1-3: getAalLpuInfo Output Parameters
Note: List of AAL Profile types to be defined, e.g. High-PHY. Types should also be versioned, e.g. High-PHY.V1
5.4.2 AALI-C-App Configuration Services
Before using AAL-Profile-Instance services the AAL Application must first create the AAL-Profile-Instance, then configure the AAL-Profile-Instance and the AAL-Profile-Queue(s).
5.4.2.1 createAalProfileInstance
Description: The AAL Application creates an AAL-Profile-Instance on the AAL-LPU. The AAL-Profile-Instance is created based on the AAL Profile type that is requested by the AAL Application. The list of available AAL Profile type(s) is provided by the AALI in the getAalLpuInfo response. After successful creation, the AAL-Profile-Instance is in a ‘in use, stopped’ state. The AAL Application may now configure the AAL-Profile-Instance, AAL-Profile-Queue(s) and start the AAL-Profile-Instance.
This procedure may be repeated by the AAL Application in order to create multiple AAL-Profile-Instances, of the same or different AAL Profile types.
Pre-conditions: AAL Application has at least 1 AAL-LPU assigned and available for use. The AAL Profile type that is requested to be created is provided by the AAL-LPU (listed in the AAL-LPU-Capability struct of the getAalLpuInfo response operation).
Triggers: On demand request from the AAL Application
Frequency: Infrequent.

Table 5.4.2.1-2: createAalProfileInstance Input Parameters
Table 5.4.2.1-3: createAalProfileInstance Output Parameters
5.4.2.2 setAalProfileInstanceConfig
Description: The AAL Application configures the AAL-Profile-Instance on the AAL-LPU for a specific AAL Profile configuration for use by the AAL Application.
Pre-conditions: AAL Application has successfully created the AAL-LPU-Profile instance on the AAL-LPU. The AAL-Profile-Instance is not started.
Triggers: On demand request from the AAL Application
Frequency: Infrequent.

Table 5.4.2.2-3: setProfileInstanceConfig Output Parameters
5.4.2.3 deleteAalProfileInstance
Description: The AAL Application may delete the AAL-Profile-Instance when it no longer requires it. For example, if a cell is deleted from the O-DU by upper layers or the OAM system, the AAL-Profile-Instance resources used to offload that cell can be deleted. After deleting the AAL-Profile-Instance, that AAL-Profile-Instance is no longer usable by the AAL Application.
Pre-conditions: The AAL Application has successfully stopped the AAL-Profile-Instance.
Triggers: On demand request from the AAL Application
Frequency: Infrequent.

Table 5.4.2.3-3: setProfileInstanceConfig Output Parameters
5.4.2.4 setAalProfileQueueConfig
Note: Use of AAL-Profile-Queue operations for user plane data transfer and buffer API operations needs to be clarified.
Description: The AAL Application configures the AAL-Profile-Queue on the AAL-Profile-Instance.
If no AAL-Profile-Queue Handle is included, this operation will create and configure a new AAL-Profile-Queue. The response will include the AAL-Profile-Queue Handle for the AAL-Profile-Queue. To add an AAL-Profile-Queue to an AAL-Profile-Instance, the AAL-Profile-Instance must be stopped by the AAL Application.
If an AAL-Profile-Queue Handle is supplied, the configuration of the AAL-Profile-Queue identified by the AAL-Profile-Queue Handle is modified with the supplied configuration. Any items already on the queue are deleted when this operation is called. The AAL-Profile-Queue must be in the stopped state.
Pre-conditions: AAL-Profile-Instance has already successfully been created in the AAL-LPU. The AAL Application has successfully configured the AAL-Profile-Instance. The AAL-Profile-Queue (if already existing) is in the stopped state. To add an AAL-Profile-Queue to an AAL-Profile-Instance, the AAL-Profile-Instance must be stopped by the AAL Application. To re-configure an existing AAL-Profile-Queue on an AAL-Profile-Instance, the AAL-Profile-Instance does not need to be stopped by the AAL Application.
Triggers: On demand request from the AAL Application
Frequency: Infrequent.
