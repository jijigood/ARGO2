1.1 Scope 2 
This Technical Specification has been produced by the O-RAN.org. 3 
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within O -RAN WG1 and may change following 4 
formal o-RAN approval. Should the o -RAN.org modify the contents of the present document, it wi ll be re -released by 5 
o-RAN Alliance with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:  6 
Release x.y.z 7 
where: 8 
x the first digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updat es, 9 
etc. (the initial approved document will have x=01). 10 
y the second digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.  11 
z the third digit included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the 12 
editing process. 13 
The present document studies O -RAN OAM architecture and interface functions. The OAM architecture supports a 14 
variety of management network deployment models, including the model of management entities (NMS/EMS/MANO) 15 
connecting directly to NEs, and the indirect connection (e.g., M -Plane involved) model. A separate OAM interface 16 
document provides details of the functions and protocols conveyed over the interface, that include management 17 
functions, procedures, operations and corresponding solutions. 18

Chapter 2.  O-RAN Overview 1 
2.1 Scope and Objectives 2 
O-RAN activities are guided by the following objectives [11]: 3 
• Leading the industry towards open, interoperable interfaces, RAN virtualization, and big data and AI enabled RAN 4 
intelligence. 5 
• Maximizing the use of common-off-the-shelf hardware and merchant silicon and minimizing proprietary hardware  6 
• Specifying APIs and interfaces, driving standards to adopt them as appropriate, and exploring open source where 7 
appropriate 8 
The O-RAN OAM Architecture identifies management services, managed functions and managed elements supported 9 
in O-RAN, including the interworking between service management and orchestration and other O -RAN components 10 
such as infrastructure management.  Requirements are derived from end-to-end OAM use cases, initially using the 11 
initial provisioning of O-RAN service across VNFs and PNFs as the primary use case.  The architecture identifies the 12 
interfaces between O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration and Managed Elements for different models and 13 
example deployment options.  It provides a description of the LifeCycle Management for applications delivered from a 14 
Solution Provider to a Service Provider/Network Operator. 15 
Future versions of the architecture will address additional areas of O-RAN OAM functionality. 16 
2.2 End to End OAM Use Cases 17 
This section contains end to end OAM use cases that O-RAN is expected to support.  Requirements will be derived 18 
from the use cases. 19 
The initial use cases defined include O-RAN Service Provisioning and Data Collection.  Additional Use Cases will be 20 
added as prioritized by the O-RAN community in future versions of this document 21 
2.2.1 O-RAN Service Provisioning 22 
2.2.1.1 Basic Objective 23 
In the O-RAN architecture, the radio side includes Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU Managed 24 
Functions, and the management side is comprised of the Service Management and Orchestration Framework (including 25 
the Non-RT RIC). In the NFV environment, O-RAN network elements can also be implemented in a virtualized form, 26 
and thus include an Infrastructure layer (e.g. COTS/White Box/Peripheral hardware  and virtualization layer) based on 27 
an O-Cloud. 28 
The current use case focuses on network/element deployment rather than physical construction. According t o the radio 29 
coverage requirement, operators could deploy the O-RAN network/element on dedicated physical resources and/or 30 
virtualized resources in a specific area.  31 
This use case assumes that the network elements are deployed based on an example Network De sign using VNFs for 32 
centralized functions and PNFs for functions closer to the customer, so that the sequence calls for deployment of VNFs 33 
for the Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP first followed by PNFs for the O-DU and O-RU. Note: RF functions 34 
must always be realized as PNFs but the O-DU can be realized as a PNF or VNF; this document uses PNF as an 35 
example to illustrate the associated OAM flows. 36 
It is also assumed that secure network connectivity is already available between RAN components.  37 
2.2.1.2 Entities/Resources involved 38 
To support the O-RAN network provisioning, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework needs to support 39 
the following capabilities: 40

/ O-RAN.WG1.OAM-
Architecture-v04.00 O-RAN.WG1.OAM-Architecture-v04.00 
• O-RAN network element deployed in selected area 1 
a) For non-virtualized parts, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework supports the deployment of 2 
physical network elements on the target dedicated physical resources which satisfy the coverage requirements, 3 
with management through the O1 interface.  4 
b) For virtualized network elements, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework has the capability 5 
to interact with the O-Cloud to perform network element life cycle management, e.g. instantiate the 6 
virtualized network element on the target infrastructure through the O2 interface (e.g., indicate the selected 7 
geo-location for each VNF to be instantiated, where close to the PNFs).  8 
c) The Service Management and Orchestration Framework has the capability to consume the provisioning 9 
management service through the O1 interface to manage the configuration of the network element, details are 10 
defined in O-RAN.WG1.OAM Interface Specification [13]. 11 
• O-RAN network provisioning 12 
a) Based on the deployed network elements, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework configures 13 
the IP addressing, etc. in the PNFs and VNFs to support connectivity between them (this operation could also 14 
be performed during the instantiation steps). 15 
b) Operators can operate and maintain the network dynamically through the O1 and/or O2 interf ace by means of: 16 
i. Reconfiguration of the network elements 17 
ii. System update (usually refers to software management, without adding network elements) and system 18 
upgrade (the network elements could be added/removed/modified) 19 
According to above, the Service Management and Orchestration Framework together with the O-Cloud implements the 20 
O-RAN network element deployment and provisioning, creating an O-RAN network to provide service to consumers.  21

2.2.2 O-RAN Measurement Data Collection 4 
2.2.2.1 Basic Objective 5 
In this use case, the Non-RT RIC as the intelligent management center located in Service Management and 6 
Orchestration Framework determines that measurement data is needed and interacts with the SMO OAM Functions to 7 
collect measurement data from network for AI/ML training/inference/analyzing, and then generate optimization 8 
operations in order to improve the end-to-end user service experience and the network performance.  9 
According to the Service Management and Orchestration Framework, to fulfill the Non -RT RIC requested data 10 
collection, the following capability should be supported by the SMO (framework):  11

i The SMO should support the MnS component Type A (defined in [6])generation and the corresponding 1 
operation performing (defined in [5] and [7]), according to the measurement data collection request from the 2 
Non-RT RIC 3 
ii The SMO (framework) should support the MnS component type C (defined in [6]) consumption such as the 4 
measurement data requested by the Non-RT RIC 5 
The current use case focuses on the Non-RT RIC requested measurement data collection and consumption, the SMO 6 
should generate the PM Job and perform the PM Job control operations accordingly, and the SMO (framework) should 7 
support the measurement data consumption by the Non-RT RIC. 8 
Notes: 9 
i In the O-RAN SMO framework, in order to avoid the PM Job confliction, it is suggested that the SMO take the 10 
responsibility for generating the PM Job and performing the PM Job control related operations. The resolution of 11 
conflict resolving by the SMO is FFS. 12 
ii In this use case, the network elements decide if the PM Job is acceptable or not, in other words, it is ultimately the 13 
network element (MnS producer) who decides whether the measurement data collection task can be established or 14 
not. 15 
iii Specifications for collecting infrastructure measurements do not yet exist. The Measurement Data Collection 16 
procedures will be updated to comply with [15] once WG6 has published the specification.  17 
iv The measurement data producer in the use case so far doesn’t refer to Network Slicing, but thi s will be added in 18 
the use case once the O-RAN network slice has been defined. 19

Chapter 3. OAM Architecture  1 
 2 
3.1 Architectural Principles 3 
The following section provides architecture principals guiding the support of OAM in the O -RAN architecture. 4 
Common OAM functions should be supported through a common set of OAM interface protocols across the different 5 
components of the O-RAN architecture 6 
Management Services should, to the degree possible, align with existing standards specifications:  7 
 3GPP 5G Specifications for management interfaces 8 
 ETSI NFV Specifications for life cycle management 9 
 O-RAN WG4.MP.0-v01.00 (Future enhancements to align to 3GPP can be considered.)   10 
O-RAN OAM specifications should refer to the 3GPP and ETSI specs and not replicate them here.  O -RAN OAM 11 
specifications must identify needed extensions to support O-RAN and exceptions which cannot be supported.  It is the 12 
goal of O-RAN to drive any needed extensions into standards to maintain alignment between O -RAN and existing 13 
standards. 14 
3.2 Architecture Requirements 15 
Defines the Architecture requirements applicable to the O-RAN reference architecture.  Architecture requirements are 16 
derived from Use Cases to be supported and define the functional needs the architecture aims to satisfy.  17 
The initial set of requirements in this document are derived from the O-RAN Service Provisioning Use Case.  More 18 
requirements may be added in future versions of the OAM Architecture. 19

/ O-RAN.WG1.OAM-
Architecture-v04.00 O-RAN.WG1.OAM-Architecture-v04.00 
Examples of Management Services supported by O-RAN include: 1 
 Provisioning 2 
 Fault Supervision 3 
 Performance Assurance 4 
 Trace Management 5 
 File Management 6 
 Software Management 7 
 Communication Surveillance 8 
 Startup and Registration of a Physical Network Function (PNF) 9 
 Instantiation and Termination of a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) 10 
 Scaling Management Services for VNF 11 
'The definition of supported management services and their APIs will be covered in the OAM O1 Interface specification  12 
[13]. 13 
3.3.1.2 Managed Elements 14 
The definition of a Managed Element (ME) is given in 3GPP TS 28.622 [3] section 4.3.3.  The ME is an IOC that 15 
supports communication over management interface(s) to the manager for purposes of control and monitoring.  16 
Examples of O-RAN Managed Elements include: 17 
 O-RAN Managed Functions deployed individually as MEs (e.g., Near-RT RIC ME, CU-CP ME, CU-UP ME, 18 
O-DU ME, O-RU ME). 19 
 Central Unit (CU) composed of CU-CP and CU-UP  20 
 ME composed of Near-RT RIC, CU-CP, CU-UP, DU and RU  21 
A variety of deployment examples and their OAM interfaces are given in a later section. Choice of deployment options 22 
will be based on operator requirements. 23 
A key motivation for the Managed Element concept is that an ME is a tightly integrated and tested group of MFs that 24 
are deployed together.  This has implications on how software updates are managed, because all software updates need 25 
to retain the property that all MFs in the ME have been tested together.  Depending on the deployment scenario and 26 
other considerations, the MFs may be grouped in different ways.  An interface is required to each ME, which can 27 
manage the communications to each MF that is contained within it.  Following sections present many examples of how 28 
the O1 interface can connect to either an ME that contains an individual MF, or to an integrated ME that contains 29 
multiple MFs. 30 
3.3.1.3 Managed Functions 31 
The definition of a Managed Function (MF) is given in 3GPP TS 28.622 [3] section 4.3.4.  An MF instance is managed 32 
using the management interface(s) exposed by its containing ME instance. 33 
O-RAN managed functions include: 34 
 Near-Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) 35 
 O-RAN Central Unit – Control Plane (O-CU-CP) 36 
 O-RAN Central Unit – User Plane (O-CU-UP) 37 
 O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU) 38

3.3.1.4 Managed Applications 2 
ManagedApplication: This Information Object Class (IOC) represents a software application that may be independently 3 
tested and separately deployed from its containing ManagedFunction instance. The containing ManagedFunction 4 
instance mediates the management service for the Managed Application. A ManagedFunction instance may have zero 5 
or more Managed Application instances. 6 
The xApp is defined in [19].  Management of the xApp shall comply with the following principles: 7 
• The O1 interface terminates on the Near-RT RIC platform ME, the Near-RT RIC platform delegates the 8 
management of xApps 9 
• xApp could be provided by the third party, it is decoupled from the O-RAN nodes, O-RAN node supports one or 10 
more xApp running on it 11 
• In order to model a variety of different types of xApps, it is necessary to extend common features of a parent Class, 12 
and the specific xApp IOC could inherit from its parent Class. 13 
According to above principles, the modeling to the xApp could be described as the following:  14 
• xApp IOC represents the management aspects of the xApp 15 
• xApp IOC inherits from ManagedApplication and could extend specific attributes. 16 
The details of the MA will be defined in the O-RAN Information Model document [23]. 17

3.3.1.5 Service Management and Orchestration Framework 19 
Service Management and Orchestration Framework is responsible for the management and orchestration of the 20 
managed elements under its span of control.  The framework can for example be a third -party Network Management 21 
System (NMS) or orchestration platform. 22 
Service Management and Orchestration Framework must provide an integration fabric and data services f or the 23 
managed functions.  The integration fabric enables interoperation and communication between managed functions 24 
within the O-RAN domain.  Data services provide efficient data collection, storage and movement capabilities for the 25 
managed functions.  In order to implement multiple OAM architecture options together with RAN service modeling, the 26 
modeling of different OAM deployment options and OAM services (integration fabric etc.) must be supported by SMO  27 
3.3.1.6 Non-Real Time Radio Intelligent Controller  28 
The non-RT RIC is a part of the Service Management & Orchestration Framework and communicates to the near -RT 29 
RIC using the A1 interface. [11]  30 
Non-RT control functionality (> 1s) and near-Real Time (near-RT) control functions (< 1s) are decoupled in the RIC. 31 
Non-RT functions include service and policy management, RAN analytics and model -training for some of the near-RT 32 
RIC functionality, and non-RT RIC optimization.  33 
3.3.1.7 Control Loop Support 34 
O-RAN defines 3 control loops with different latency bands [11]. It is not expected that these loops are hierarchical but 35 
instead run in parallel. This does not mean that an ME with an inner loop will not generate its own event as result of an 36 
inner loop failure, but it will not simply propagate the lower level event received by the inner loop. The three loops are 37 
roughly defined as: 38 
- Loop 1: In the DU for per TTI/msec resource scheduling (<10 millisecond)  39 
- Loop 2: In the Near-RT RIC and CU for resource optimization (10 milliseconds to 1 second) 40 
- Loop 3: In the Service Management and Orchestration Framework for ML Training, Trending, Orchestration (> 41 
1 second) 42

3.3.2 Basic OAM Architecture  2 
 3 
Figure 3.3.2-1 O-RAN OAM Logical Architecture 4 
Figure 3.3.2-1 shows the overall O-RAN OAM Logical Architecture.  In the original white paper [11], the interface 5 
between the Manager and the O-RAN components for control purposes was identified as A1.  The O-RAN OAM 6 
Architecture adds another interface for OAM functions, labeled O1 (OAM). O1 is the interface between  the O-RAN 7 
Managed Element and the management entity.  Note: the figure uses 5G terminology, however the same principles will 8 
apply for LTE/4G.  Mapping to LTE/4G may be added in future.  O-RAN OAM also adds the O2 interface for 9 
management of the O-Cloud, which has different requirements from the O1 interface and as defined in [21].   10 
The O1 OAM Interface includes implementation of Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security (FCAPS) 11 
functions, File management and Software management functions to ME (s) virtualized and physical alike. For details of 12 
the management services supported by O1, see [13]. 13 
The O2 OAM Interface enables the management of O-Cloud infrastructures and the deployment life cycle management 14 
of O-RAN cloudified NFs that run on an O-Cloud.  For details of the functions supported by O2, see [21].  15 
As shown in the figure, there is a logical OAM interface to individual O-RAN Managed Functions, however in practice 16 
the grouping of Managed Functions into Managed Elements will determine where actual O1 interfaces are terminated.  17 
More detail is explained in subsequent sections.  The O1 interface could be the terminated directly on the Service 18 
Management & Orchestration Framework or in a hierarchical model could be terminated on a Managed E lement which 19 
manages other O-RAN Managed Functions.  20 
The sections below identify possible management topologies, for example, the basic “flat” model of OAM relationships 21 
as well as the hierarchical model of O-DU to O-RU relationship and the hybrid model of O-DU to O-RU relationship 22 
defined in the O-RAN Front Haul M-Plane specification, as well as example deployment options. 23 
3.3.3 OAM Models and Deployment Options 24 
This section provides examples of possible models and deployments of Managed Functions into Managed E lements.  25 
Adoption of a single model is not required in the O-RAN OAM Architecture, rather multiple model deployments may 26 
be supported in a network. 27

3.3.3.1 Flat Management Architecture Model 1 
 2 
Figure 3.3.3-1: Flat Model 3 
In the Flat management model, all the MFs comprising the O-RAN architecture are also MEs and expose an O1 4 
interface to the SMO. Note: The Open Fronthaul M-Plane does not support a flat management model for the O-RU. 5 
NM/orchestration platforms provide a distributed deployment model of NM functions which allows for greater scaling 6 
and lower latency functions that traditional centralized monolithic NM implementations. In this specification, no 7 
specific platform is required, however the NM is assumed to have orchestration capabilities. Therefore, deplo yment of 8 
SMOs, analytics, configuration and control functions can be potentially collocated with some of the NEs. This allows 9 
for localized processing and localized scaling to handle the expected large number of NEs to be managed. The NM 10 
functions can be distributed across the network edge and therefore handle a logically flat architecture.  11 
3.3.3.2 Hierarchical Management Architecture Model 12 
Where the distributed NM architecture is not available it may be desirable to deploy a hierarchical management 13 
architecture where a higher level ME is used to manage a subnetwork of MEs as shown in Figure 3.3.3 -2, where the O-14 
DU manages the O-RU using the Open Front Haul M-Plane interface. 15 
 16 
Figure 3.3.3-2: Hierarchical Model Example 17 
In the example of the figure 3-3, the O-RU is managed by the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface to the O-DU rather 18 
than the Service Management & Orchestration Framework, so there is a hierarchical relationship between Service 19

Management & Orchestration and the O-DU.  The O-DU must provide a consistent and standardized view of the 1 
subtending O-RUs as specified above. 2 
3.3.3.3 Hybrid Management Architecture Model 3 
In the Hybrid management architecture, the O-RU is managed partially by the O-DU and partially by the SMO. 4 
The management by O-DU is via the Open Fronthaul M-Plane, and the SMO manages the O-RU through a direct 5 
interface.  Note: The O-RU currently supports hybrid mode using an Open Fronthaul M-Plane logical direct interface 6 
defined in the Open Fronthaul M-Plane specification [12] between the O-RU and SMO. This direct interface may be 7 
augmented with an O1 Interface at some time in the future, as in [17].   8 
 9 
 10 
 11 
 12 
Figure 2.3.3-3: Hybrid Model  13 
Management responsibility is divided in this case between the O-DU and the Service Management & Orchestration 14 
Framework.  Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface in the figure is defined in [12]. The O-RU supports connection to 15 
multiple clients as well as access control that can be used to control the privilege s available to a particular client in 16 
Open Fronthaul M-Plane [12]. The alignment between the Open Fronthaul M-Plane and O1 interfaces is for further 17 
study. 18 
3.3.3.4 Example Managed Deployment Options 19 
In aggregated equipment, the Managed Element contains multiple internal Managed Functions.  This section provides a 20 
number of examples showing how the OAM architecture is applied to different groupings of Managed Functions into 21 
Managed Elements.  Use cases associated with different deployment options are defined in [15] . 22 
Figure 3.3.3-4 shows a single Managed Element that contains CU-CP, CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU Managed Functions. 23

Figure 3.3.3-4: Example with Single Integrated ME 2 
As shown in the figure 3.3.3-4, there is a single O1 interface to the Managed Element.  However, the O1 interface still 3 
provides a consistent and standardized view of the Managed Functions that are contained within the Managed Element.  4 
Figure 3.3.3-5 shows another example where the Near-RT RIC has been split off as a standalone ME. 5 
 6 
Figure 3.3.3-5: Example with Single Integrated ME + Standalone Near-RT RIC 7 
In the example of Figure 3.3.3-5, there are separate O1 interfaces supported by each ME.  The ME containing the Near -8 
RT RIC Managed Function supports management of only this function through its O 1 interface, while the ME 9 
containing the other Managed Functions provides a view of all contained functions.  10

3.3.4 Managed Elements Deployed behind a NAT 3 
Service Providers prefer to not deploy Managed Elements (ME) behind a NAT, but there are cases where this cannot be 4 
avoided, for example:  5 
 exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses 6 
 managed elements deployed in large complexes not owned by the Service Provider (Apartments, Sports 7 
Venues etc.) 8 
 managed elements connected via third-party networks using a NAT 9 
 10 
When a Service Provider deploys managed elements behind a NAT it is critical that they are able to retain full 11 
management control of these elements. 12 
  13 
  14 
Figure 3.3.4.1 O-RAN MEs behind a NAT 15 
  16 
Four methods of providing the O-RAN Manager with the ability to address a ME behind a NAT and identify data 17 
received from a ME behind a NAT are recommended in priority order: 18 
1. ME uses IPv6 as Backhaul transport where possible eliminating the need for a NAT - exhaustion of public 19 
IPv4 addresses 20 
2. ME establishes persistent VPN tunnel (e.g. IPSec) toward a VPN concentrator (gateway) located outside of 21 
network with the NAT.  The ME is then accessible through the established tunnel. 22 
3. ME uses a standard protocol (UPNP or PCP) to establish a port-forwarding rule at the firewall and 23 
automatically assign itself a port. 24

Chapter 4. Application Lifecycle Management (LCM) 1 
This chapter describes Lifecycle Management of applications that are developed by 2 
a Solution Provider and delivered to a Service Provider or Network Operator for 3 
deployment in O-RAN.  The chapter’s current focus is on LCM of rApps and xApps, 4 
as defined in [17]. 5 
Lifecycle Management follows the basic models of a Software Development 6 
Lifecycle by defining the transitional information from one state to another. There 7 
are several Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) definitions. For the purposes 8 
of discussion this document generally follows a 7-state model as shown in Figure 4-9 
3. Some states might also include activities that align with other states. However, 10 
this level of detail is not depicted here in order to introduce those details later in the 11 
document. 12 
A Service Provider or Network Operator has needs which are fulfilled by a Solution 13 
Provider. Once the Solution Provider delivers the application it is validated in a test 14 
environment prior to giving to operations to deploy.  Usage of the deployed application may result in changes to 15 
configuration by the Service Provider or may be feedback to Solution Providers to evolve the capabilities of the 16 
network and/or its management. 17 
Although applications may come in many forms the delivery from the Solution Provider 18 
to the Service Provider needs to be done in a standardized manner. The seven steps 19 
defined in the SDLC are high level. Each may break down into a set of finer grain steps.  20 
4.1 Scope 21 
The end-to-end lifecycle involves two entities, the Solution Provider and the Service Provider. The Solution Provider 22 
provides applications for the Service Provider to use in their network. The working flow could be summarized as three 23 
phases: Development, Onboarding and Operations, as shown in Figure 4.1-4. 24 
 25 
Figure 4.1-4 Application Lifecycle Phases 26 
These applications need to be onboarded in a common manner, regardless of how they are deployed. This document 27 
focuses on the data that must be included in the App Package as it is exchanged between the Solution Provider and the 28 
Service Provider. This exchange is referred to as the "SP" exchange. This is not a formal interface between systems and 29 
therefore is not denoted as other O-RAN interfaces are. Care is given as not to put implementation or tooling mandates 30 
on either the Solution Provider in their development of the application, or the Service Provider in the aspect of training 31 
or deploying the application. Aspects of the lifecycle across both parties are introduced. However, not all aspects are 32 
discussed. Instead the focus is on those activities that affect the data contained in the SP Exchange.  Later in this 33 
document the term "Service Planning" is used to represent activities internal to the Service Provider. This is not the 34

Lifecycle

same as the "SP Exchange" used to describe the data passed from the Solution Provider to the Service Provider. The 1 
method of the SP Exchange is not defined in this document. It is sometimes referred to as the "Marketplace". The 2 
marketplace can be implemented by either the solution provider, the service provider, and an external en tity to both. 3 
The Marketplace simply represents an exchange between entities which could be done by electronic means or physical 4 
media.  5 
The App Development will provide application solutions w/wo AI/ML models, while “App Onboard” and “App 6 
Operate” will be responsible for application onboarding and operations. Considering the data privacy and security 7 
requirements, the application development could be completed in the environment provided by the Service Provider.  8 
Applications utilize AI/ML models or not. Therefore, although the Model Information may be optional in the package, 9 
we will focus on the data exchange requirements for applications with AI/ML models as the superset.  10 
4.1.1 Information Model 11 
An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a way to pictorially show relationships and cardinality between "Entities". 12 
Entities can be anything, physical, logical, or conceptual. They usually have some attributes to differentiate one instance 13 
from another. The entities relationship is identified with a connector which uses symbols at both ends to show the 14 
cardinality between the entities. The symbol represents the cardinality of the far end to the entity near the symbol. These 15 
basic concepts are shown in Figure 4.1-5 Entity Relationship Diagram Basic ComponentsFigure 4.1-5. Some other 16 
notations are fields marked as a Primary Key (PK), a Foreign Key (FK), or an Alternate Key (AK). Numbers may be 17 
appended to show when multiple fields are combined to create a unique key value. 18 
 19 
Figure 4.1-5 Entity Relationship Diagram Basic Components 20 
The following ERD diagram illustrates the composition of the Application Package. An Application Package is the 21 
basic unit exchanged between the Solution Provider and Service Provider. The attributes of the entities in the diagram 22 
are representative. The actual contents are FFS and will be refined in a later release of this document.  23

The following modifiers can be pre-pended to Information Model Elements to indicate context: 5 
"Solution" The version of the element as defined by the Solution Provider 6 
"Onboarded" The initial version of the catalogued elements created during onboarding.  7 
"Catalogue" Subsequent versions of the catalogued package or its elements which may have been adjusted by 8 
the Service Provider. 9 
The "Application Package" contains a Metadata repository with metadata files in YAML [21]   format. It also contains 10 
a security metadata file in YAML format which describes the procedures used for ensuring the integri ty of the software 11 
contained in the package. 12 
The Application Package also contains repositories for Deployment Configurations, Application Types, and 13 
Deployable Components. An optional repository for ML Models is supplied for Application Packages with one or 14 
more application types employing ML technology. 15 
ML Models may be pre-trained by the Solution Provider and therefore provide initial Training History. The Service 16 
Provider may also train the model or retrain the model with a more specialized data set, th is is called specialization. 17 
The Training History provides the mechanism to record all training and subsequent specializations applied to that 18 
training through the Training History. 19 
An example of specialization is a ML Model created to predict the flow of traffic volumes. This algorithm can be 20 
generally trained to follow road patterns for devices with a velocity greater than 20 miles per hour. This training could 21 
be done by the Solution Provider on a generalized or open data set and recording in the Solution Training History. 22 
After onboarding the Service Provider may provide specialized training for dense urban traffic patterns which don't 23 
always follow the roads due to periodic traffic congestion This would be an additional Training History record added 24 
by the Service Provider and referenced as specialization in the Catalogue Training History. Further refinement could 25 
also be applied for specific cities such as New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco which would now add 3 26 
specializations Catalogue Training History records relating to the dense urban Catalogue Training History which is 27 
a specialization if the Onboarded Training History. 28

Once a Catalogue Deployment Configuration is validated as safe for use in operations it is published to a runtime 1 
environment as a Published Deployment Configuration. Runtime instance data can be applied to the Published 2 
Deployment Configuration. Application Types deployed as part of this activity are call an App Instance. An APP 3 
Instance running in the Non-RT RIC Runtime can be referred to as an rAPP instance.  An App Instance running in the 4

the exact mechanism of the exchange is outside the scope of this document. Destination or Decision points are color 12 
coded according to their user community. Destination or Decision points are not a contributing factor to the data 13

Customer feedback can consist of use case requirements, feature requests, defect notifications, or a variety of other 3 
comments. These feed the development cycle to develop new application or enhance existing ones. Requirements are 4 
usually identified and sent to developers to implement. The outcome of the build process is the container images built 5 
using SDKs for their intended deployments. If the application is AI/ML enabled, then the training action is done. The 6 
training might happen with synthetic data or with data provided by Service Providers. Information on the training 7 
performed will be included in the Solution Training History. The completed Solution App Type is stored in a 8 
development repository. 9

Figure 4.1-9: Solution App Package App Development Lifecycle 13 
The Solution App Package is used to convey the Solution App Type through the onboarding process to the  Service 14 
Provider. It begins by pulling the Application App Type out of its repository and placing it in the package as mandated 15 
by the exchange requirements. Next security is applied such that the Service Provider can ensure that an Onboarded 16 
Application Package did in fact come from the expected Solution Provider. The secure package, Solution App Package, 17 
is then delivered to the Service Provider for onboarding. 18

4.1.4.2 Onboarded App Type Lifecycles 12 
The App Onboarding Phase for Onboarded App Types is split between normal processing for all applications, named 13 
"Configuration", and the lifecycle for "Training" App Types with included AI/ML Models. Workflow can interchange 14 
between these cycles iteratively.  We will treat each of these separately below. 15 
 16 
4.1.4.2.1 Onboarded App Type Configuration Lifecycle 17 
The Service Operator Configuration steps associated with an Onboarded App Type are shown below:  18 
 19 
Figure 4.1-11 Onboarded App Type Service Provider Configuration Lifecycle 20 
Onboarded App Types are made visible in the SMO environment when published into the catalogue. Each 21 
recommended configuration of the App Type is certified prior to publication to a runtime library. If Certific ation fails, 22 
then Service Planning will determine the next course of action.  23 
Service Planning aggregates “fix” requests from Configuration which can be passed back to the Solution Provider (at 24 
the App Package level) as feedback across the SP interface of the Marketplace Exchange.   This exchange also 25 
aggregates “change” requests from Configuration or Operations and determines if the request is for additional 26 
development (a “feature” request) or additional training (a “training” request).  The former would be aggregated and 27

passed back to the Solution Provider via the SP interface as described above for “fix” requests.  For the latter, the 1 
Service Design: Training lifecycle would ensue. 2 
If the Onboarded App Type requires AI/ML training, then a request through Service Planning is used to train the model. 3 
When the "Specialized App Type" is returned, like non-ML Onboarded App Types it is catalogued and scheduled for 4 
certification. Once certified the App Type is distributed as a Published App Type to a Run Time L ibrary. From there 5 
operations can deploy as either a management (rApp) or network application instance (xApp).  6 
4.1.4.2.2 App Type Training Lifecycle 7 
The Service Operator Training Lifecycle associated with a Training App Type is shown below:  8 
 9 
Figure 4.1-12: Training App Type Service Provider Training Lifecycle 10 
When a training request is received then resources within the training environment are scheduled for the application. 11 
Data is collected and groomed for training after which a training iteration is executed. At the end of the training cycle a 12 
test set is applied to the model and accuracy is calculated. If the test fails or other metadata indicates more training 13 
iterations are required, then the cycle repeats. Once the model is adequately trained it is promoted and sent back to 14 
service planning for continuation in another lifecycle. 15 
Inside the "Training Lifecycle" the process MAY require multiple iterations of training before being returned to the 16 
Service Planning MMP. 17 
The iteration count SHALL be included in the specialization metadata info. 18

4.1.5 App Operation Lifecycles 1 
There can be many runtime environments in the service providers’ network. Some can be production while others might 2 
be for non-production execution, such as offline training and lab certification. For this document we will focus on the 3 
runtime aspects of rApps, which execute within the Non-RT RIC as part of the SMO, and the xApps which execute in 4 
the near-RT RIC as part of the RAN. Although they have the same lifecycle steps the data demands due to their 5 
operational environment are different and therefore need to be independently addressed.  6 
4.1.5.1 App Instance Lifecycles 7 
 8 
Figure 4.1-13: Service Provider Runtime Lifecycles 9 
After the App Instance is created through a deploy operation it is monitored. As monitoring reports the health and 10 
workload of the application it is scaled up and down based on demand. Based on monitoring result, a series of operation 11 
and management functions are triggered, such as alert management, event management, incident management and 12 
further analysis. The analysis results can be guidance for further actions such as termination, healing and scaling. 13 
Finally, when its job is completed the instance is terminated. While in operation the service provider may discover 14 
defects, performance issues, or identify new features that would be beneficial. Such issue or change request will 15 
be communicated to the Service planning where the Application could be retrained or updated. The information can 16 
also be sent via the Service Planning to the Solution Provider as feedback.  17 
Operations determine when an application is deployed, or undeployed. Since applications are atomic, the update process 18 
is an orchestrated process of deploy and terminate. It is possible for two versions to be active at the same time, but care 19 
must be given not to provide overlapping scopes to the application instances, otherwise they may give differing 20 
directives to the network in a random order. This could cause a destabilization of the network. 21 
4.2 Common Application Lifecycle Conclusions 22 
The initial conclusion of Common Application Lifecycle procedures is that there is a formalized exchange between the 23 
Solution Provider and the Service Provider, the "SP Exchange". The SP Exchange consists of data describing the 24 
package and its security. The package also contains information regarding Deployment Configurations, Application 25 
Types, Deployable Components, and potentially ML Models. Further details regarding the composition of these areas 26 
will be defined through analysis of the Actions identified in section 4.1 as an action requiring further analysis (Bolded). 27

Appendix A: Cardinality 1 
This informative Appendix provides background information regarding the cardinality of different O -RAN architecture 2 
elements.  It is not intended as a requirement on cardinality.   3 
The RAN network has an expected hierarchical fan out. Therefore, the O-RAN sizing would be: 4 
- Non-RT RIC (1..j) 5 
- Near-RT RIC (1..k) 6 
- CU-CP (1..m) 7 
- CU-UP (1..n) 8 
- O-DU (1..p) 9 
- O-RU (1..q) 10 
Where: 1<=j; j<=k; k<=m; m<=n; m<=p; p<=q 11 
Due to resiliency and scaling aspects of cloud implementations an O-DU will logically be connected to one CU-CP. The 12 
CU-CP may in fact be a pool of CU-CP instances to handle loads. 13 
CU-UP MEs will be pooled and aligned with the services they are configured to serve. The CU -CP will assign the CU-14 
UP that an O-DU needs to connect to for a given UE session. 15 
An O-DU may serve many O-RU MEs depending on its designed capacity to manage the loop 1 processing.  16 
One Near-RT RIC will be connected to multiple CU-CP, CU-UP, and O-DU MEs. For resiliency the MEs may be 17 
connected to more than one Near-RT RIC, however, it shall not require duplication of data to be sent to each RIC 18 
instance. 19 
A Near-RT RIC will be connected to one non-RT RIC. 20

B.4 Depicting Service Management and Orchestration Participants 16 
Service Management and Orchestration participants can vary by type. The following UML shows the standard types for 17 
defined participants. Participants  can be deleted when not pertinent to the use case but additional participants should be 18 
avoided unless they are defined in the O-RAN Architecture Description [17] or other O-RAN specifications.  For 19 
consistency SMO should be the second group unless the personnel group is not required which would make this the first 20 
group. The color “#gold” has been identified as the background for this group of use case participants. 21 
The O-RAN Architecture [17]  identifies three types of functions in SMO: FCAPS for O -RAN Network 22 
Functions(named here as “OAM Functions”), Non-RT RIC, and O-Cloud Management, Orchestration and Workflow 23 
Management.   The O2 General Aspects and Principles [21] further distinguishes between management of the 24 
distribution of O-Cloud software and orchestration for O-Cloud life cycle processes, called “Federated O-Cloud 25 
Operations and Management”, or “FOCOM”, and coordination between SMO and the O-Cloud for managing 26 
deployment life cycle events and operational processes, called “Network Function Orchestration”, or “NFO”.  These are 27 
shown as participants in the UML as below. 28

B.5 Depicting Cloud Platform Participants 6 
As described in the O-Ran Architecture Description [17] the Cloud platform has two roles. These are depicted by the 7 
end points in the O-Cloud Management and Control Planes. The Infrastructure Management Services (IMS) provides 8 
management of the O-Cloud as a platform. The Deployment Management Services (DMS) provides management of 9 
Deployments using the O-Cloud resources. Like in the SMO the internal software modules and components to the O -10 
Cloud can vary from implementation to implementation. Therefore it is not advised to add additional entities unless it is 11 
unavoidable for the use case. The color “#lightseagreen” has been identified as the background for this group of use 12 
case participants. 13

Synchronous calls have an implicit return or the return can be implicitly depicted, often after a long block so as to 16 
provide clarity of where processing continues. Some use cases can be used with a start message and end with either a 17 
message or response. This is helpful when a common block can be used multiple times.  18

B.12 Grouping and References 18 
Grouping can be used for many different aspects. In UML there are many types of groups. PlantUML support the basic 19 
three. Any of the group types can be nested. “Alt” for conditional processing which can show different path processing 20 
rather than just a sunny day scenario. It can also be used to show any logical, as the condition is stated in the swim lane, 21 
processing. Sometimes the message and the grouping boundary are close and need some separation. Use the “|||” to 22 
create that space. 23 
The “loop” group is used to show iterations or conditional loops. The loop condition is stated on the lines a nd contain 24 
the statements within the loop. 25 
The last kind of group is the fragment. This is a logic group of a sequence of events that go together. The tag line at the 26 
top describes the group. 27

Annex A: SMO and Non-RT RIC mapping with 3GPP management 1 
system 2 
This section shows the SMO, Non-RT RIC and the related management interface/service mapping with 3GPP 3 
management system.  4 
In [9], 3GPP defines the network management and orchestration architecture for 3GPP networks including network 5 
slicing. T he management  data analytic function (MDAF) is identified as the key function to enable the intelligent 6 
management of the network, which provide s management data analytics service (MDAS) to both the management 7 
functions and the network element. Meanwhile, intent  driven management service (IDMS) is under discussion in 3GPP 8 
SA5, where the management system could generate intent as the target of the network optimization and automation. The 9 
management system should have the capability to consume the service (IDMS)  provided by the network. Currently, the 10 
two studies are mainly to enable the network management automaton and intelligence. In this sense, it is quite aligned 11 
with the motivation of introducing Non-RT RIC in O-RAN. 12 
To better understand the O-RAN OAM architecture, the management services defined in O-RAN, and the relationship 13 
with 3GPP and the potential gaps between 3GPP and O-RAN.  Fig. A-1 below tries to do some mapping between the 14 
SMO, Non-RT RIC and 3GPP management system and interfaces with the following prelimi nary analysis.  15 
1. A1 interface is closely related to the current SA5 3GPP IDMS and MDAS study.  16 
(1) A1-P, as declarative policy is closely related to Intent-NOP discussed in IDMS. Performance target is 17 
expected to be provided by management system via the IDMS. But only system level targets are being 18 
discussed in the IDMS study. A1-P is finer granularity to enable the UE level, group UE level and even 19 
application level automation and optimization. 20 
(2) A1-EI/ML is closely related to the 3GPP MDAS study. MDAS provider is  expected to provide data analytics 21 
reports and recommendations to the consumers, e.g., CN or RAN leveraging the data analytics and machine 22 
learning technologies. AI-EI/ML studied in O-RAN is to enable the enrichment information communication 23 
and ML model management towards the RAN. The enrichment information may come from the data 24 
analytics based on the historical RAN data collected over O1 interface or from RAN external data sources. In 25 
this sense, A1-EI/ML has a larger scope than the MDAS in 3GPP.  26 
2. O1 interface reflects the 3GPP traditional FCAPS management services. 27 
3. O2 interface perform the O-Cloud management, the mapping with 3GPP is FFS. 28 
4. Non-RT RIC could be seen as a MDAF instance, which provides management data analytic service to both internal 29 
functions reside in the SMO and external consumers such as near-RT RIC. 30 
The management service, Non -RT RIC and A1 work in O -RAN will  continue evolve and the MDAS/IDMS related 31 
SI/WI are under study and still in early stage in 3GPP. The gap analysis and mapping relationship will be continuously 32 
updated based on the latest progress.  33

ii. The Security management service and Accounting management defined in 3GPP so far they are not used in OAM 4 
Functions. 5 
iii. The A1 Policy management, A1 EI management, A1 ML management are being studied in O-RAN and being 6 
implemented in O-RAN software community. 7 
iv. The A1 Policy management maps to 3GPP IDMS. 8 
v. A1 EI management and A1 ML management is correlated to the MDAS, when the EI is retrieved from the Data 9 
Analytic and AI/ML Model Training, the concrete mapping relationship with 3GPP is FFS. 10 
vi. The Data Analytics and AI/ML Model Training studied in O-RAN maps to 3GPP RAN domain MDAS producer. 11

Annex ZZZ : O-RAN Adopter License Agreement 1 
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O -RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER 2 
AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 3 
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O -RAN Alliance and the 4 
entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”). 5 
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification. 6 
Section 1: DEFINITIONS 7 
1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with 8 
another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of 9 
fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity. 10 
1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether implemented in hardware, 11 
software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification. 12 
1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their 13 
Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications. 14 
1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does 15 
not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O -RAN 16 
Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates. 17 
1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design 18 
patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable by a Member, 19 
Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) 20 
such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payme nt of 21 
consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering 22 
any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible 23 
on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art 24 
generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O -RAN Alliance or the date the patent 25 
claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate 26 
a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a 27 
Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent 28 
claims shall be considered Necessary Claims. 29 
1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, 30 
Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term 31 
allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the 32 
licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates. 33 
Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE 34 
2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, 35 
nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN 36 
Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in 37 
furtherance of implementations of an O-RAN 38 
Specification. 39 
2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate writte n 40 
agreement with O-RAN Alliance. 41 
Section 3: FRAND LICENSE 42 
3.1 Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separate 43 
Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non - Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and 44 
conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to 45 
Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, 46 
use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such 47 
license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated 48

that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal 1 
grant to Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors, as set forth in Section 3.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the 2 
foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Adopter’s distributors and the use by the Adopter’s 3 
customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations. 4 
3.2 Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has 5 
reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter 6 
is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and 7 
its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees. 8 
3.3 Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License 9 
Agreement to each Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates under  Fair 10 
Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a 11 
nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non -sublicensable, worldwide patent 12 
license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute 13 
Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license will not extend: (a) to any part or function of a 14 
product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or 15 
(b) to any Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates that is not making a reciprocal 16 
grant to Adopter, as set forth in Section 3.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes 17 
the distribution by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ distributors 18 
and the use by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and  their Affiliates’ customers of such 19

4.1 This Agreement shall remain in force, unless early terminated according to this Section 4.  22 
4.2 O-RAN Alliance on behalf of its Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors may terminate this Agreement 23 
if Adopter materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure or is not capable of curing such breach within thirty 24 
(30) days after being given notice specifying the breach. 25 
4.3 Sections 1, 3, 5 - 11 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Under surviving Section 3, 26 
after termination of this Agreement, Adopter will continue to grant licenses (a) to entities who become Adopters after 27 
the date of termination; and (b) for future versions of O-RAN Specifications that are backwards compatible with the 28 
version that was current as of the date of termination. 29 
Section 5: CONFIDENTIALITY 30 
Adopter will use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication, and dissemination  of O-RAN 31 
Specifications to third parties, as Adopter employs with its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable 32 
care. Any disclosure by Adopter to its Affiliates, contractors and consultants should be subject to an obligation of 33 
confidentiality at least as restrictive as those contained in this Section. The foregoing obligation shall not apply to any 34 
information which is: (1) rightfully known by Adopter without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to disclosure; (2) 35 
publicly available through no fault of Adopter; (3) rightfully received without a duty of confidentiality; (4) disclosed by 36 
O-RAN Alliance or a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor to a third party without a duty of confidentiality 37 
on such third party; (5) independently developed by Adopter; (6) disclosed pursuant to the order of a court or other 38 
authorized governmental body, or as required by law, provided that Adopter provides reasonable prior written notice to 39 
O-RAN Alliance, and cooperates with O-RAN Alliance and/or the applicable Member, Contributor or Academic 40 
Contributor to have the opportunity to oppose any such order; or (7) disclosed by Adopter with O -RAN Alliance’s prior 41 
written approval. 42
