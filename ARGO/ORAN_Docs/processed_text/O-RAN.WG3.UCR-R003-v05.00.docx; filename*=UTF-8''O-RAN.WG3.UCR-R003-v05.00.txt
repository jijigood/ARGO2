3	Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

3.1	Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions [given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [i.1] and the following] apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [i.1].

A1 policy: Type of declarative policies expressed using formal statements that enable the non-RT RIC function in the SMO to guide the near-RT RIC function, and hence the RAN, towards better fulfilment of the RAN intent.

A1 Enrichment information: Information utilized by near-RT RIC that is collected or derived at SMO/non-RT RIC either from non-network data sources or from network functions themselves.

A1-Policy Based Traffic Steering Process Mode: An operational mode in which the Near-RT RIC is configured through A1 Policy to use Traffic Steering Actions to ensure a more specific notion of network performance (for example, applying to smaller groups of E2 Nodes and UEs in the RAN) than that which it ensures in the Background Traffic Steering.

Background Traffic Steering Processing Mode: An operational mode in which the Near-RT RIC is configured through O1 to use Traffic Steering Actions to ensure a general background network performance which applies broadly across E2 Nodes and UEs in the RAN.

Baseline RAN Behavior: The default RAN behavior as configured at the E2 Nodes by SMO

E2:  Interface connecting the Near-RT RIC and one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, one or more O-DUs, and one or more O-eNBs.

E2 Node: a logical node terminating E2 interface. In this version of the specification, O-RAN nodes terminating E2 interface are:

-	for NR access: O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU or any combination;

-	for E-UTRA access: O-eNB.

FCAPS: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security.

Intents: A declarative policy to steer or guide the behavior of RAN functions, allowing the RAN function to calculate the optimal result to achieve stated objective.

Non-RT RIC (O-RAN non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller): a logical function that enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources, AI/ML workflow including model training and updates, and policy-based guidance of applications/features in Near-RT RIC.

Near-RT RIC (O-RAN near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller): a logical function that enables near-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained (e.g., UE basis, Cell basis) data collection and actions over E2 interface.

O-CU (O-RAN Central Unit): a logical node hosting RRC, SDAP and PDCP protocols

O-CU-CP (O-RAN Central Unit – Control Plane): a logical node hosting the RRC and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol

O-CU-UP (O-RAN Central Unit – User Plane): a logical node hosting the user plane part of the PDCP protocol and the SDAP protocol

O-DU (O-RAN Distributed Unit): a logical node hosting RLC/MAC/High-PHY layers based on a lower layer functional split.

O-eNB (O-RAN eNB): an eNB or ng-eNB that supports E2 interface.

O-RU (O-RAN Radio Unit): a logical node hosting Low-PHY layer and RF processing based on a lower layer functional split.  This is similar to 3GPP’s “TRP” or “RRH” but more specific in including the Low-PHY layer (FFT/iFFT, PRACH extraction).

O1: Interface between orchestration & management entities (Orchestration/NMS) and O-RAN managed elements, for operation and management, by which FCAPS management, Software management, File management and other similar functions shall be achieved.

RAN UE Group: Aggregations of UEs whose grouping is set in the E2 nodes through E2 procedures also based on the scope of A1 policies.  These groups can then be the target of E2 CONTROL or POLICY messages.

Traffic Steering Action: The use of a mechanism to alter RAN behavior. Such actions include E2 procedures such as CONTROL and POLICY.

Traffic Steering Inner Loop: The part of the Traffic Steering processing, triggered by the arrival of periodic TS related KPM (Key Performance Measurement) from E2 Node, which includes UE grouping, setting additional data collection from the RAN, as well as selection and execution of one or more optimization actions to enforce Traffic Steering policies.

Traffic Steering Outer Loop: The part of the Traffic Steering processing, triggered by the Near-RT RIC setting up or updating Traffic Steering aware resource optimization procedure based on information from A1 Policy setup or update, A1 Enrichment Information (EI) and/or outcome of Near-RT RIC evaluation, which includes the initial configuration (preconditions) and injection of related A1 policies, Triggering conditions for TS changes.

Traffic Steering Processing Mode: An operational mode in which either the RAN or the Near-RT RIC is configured to ensure a particular network performance.  This performance includes such aspects as cell load and throughput, and it can apply differently to different E2 nodes and UEs.  Throughout this process, Traffic Steering Actions are used to fulfill the requirements of this configuration.

Traffic Steering Target: The intended performance result that is desired from the network, which is configured to Near-RT RIC over O1.

4	Use cases

4.1	Use case 1: Traffic Steering

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for near RT RIC and E2 interface to support Traffic Steering, whose end-to-end requirements are defined in [23].

4.1.1	Background and goal of the use case

The rapid traffic growth and multiple frequency bands utilized in a commercial network make it challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution. Typical controls are limited to adjusting the cell reselection and handover parameters; and modifying load calculations and cell priorities.

The goal of Near-RT RIC Traffic Steering is to interpret the Policies received over A1 and to determine the optimum changes it can make towards achieving those goals. It may also leverage the A1 enrichment information.  Traffic Steering may reuse mechanisms provided by other use cases to effect the changes necessary to achieve its goals.

More specifically, Near-RT RIC triggers E2 procedure and related control/policies so as to obtain network performance that would fulfill the criteria identified in the A1 policies.

4.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

OAM Functions in SMO domain:

Collect necessary measurement metrics from network level measurement report and enrichment data (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models

Deploy or update, configure the relevant TS optimization AI/ML models to Near-RT RIC via O1.

Non-RT RIC in SMO domain:

Send A1 policies and receive policy feedback to/from Near-RT RIC to drive resource optimization at RAN level.

E.g., TS targets as defined in [24]

Near-RT RIC:

Supports update of AI/ML models from SMO.

Supports inference, such as traffic prediction, using AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC based on network data, e.g., measurement reports from E2 Node.

Supports interpretation and execution of A1 policies from Non-RT RIC.

Sends TS resource optimization related policies and commands to E2 Node to influence RRM behavior.

Sends the relevant A1 policy feedback to Non-RT RIC for potential policy update.

Sends the relevant O1 performance data to OAM Functions; these may be used by Non-RT RIC for potential policy update

E2 Node:

Supports reporting of UE context, network measurements, and UE measurements to Near-RT RIC over E2 interface.

Executes policies and commands received from Near-RT RIC over E2 interface

Supports network and UE performance report to OAM Functions in SMO domain over O1 interface.

4.1.3	Solutions

In this section the possible processing modes of Traffic Steering are described. Figure 4.1.3-1 shows three general Traffic Steering processing modes and the transitions between them.

These modes represent the way the Near-RT RIC (or RAN) operates on a given group of UEs, and not the operation of any component as a whole.  As such, the Near-RT RIC, could be operating in both modes 1 and 2 concurrently for different sets of UEs.  For example, the transition from Mode 0 or 1 to 2 occurs only for a group of UE defined by the A1 policy Scope. At the same time, other UE groups may still be handled in Mode 0 and/or 1.

Figure 4.1.3-1: Traffic Steering Processing Modes

The three processing modes are described in more detail below:

“Baseline” Traffic Steering Behavior: OAM Functions in SMO domain uses O1 configuration on one or more E2 node to set up a desired baseline behavior.  This also sets up baseline Performance Monitoring of E2 Node by the SMO. In this mode, Near-RT RIC is not involved.

“Background” Near-RT RIC Processing: OAM Functions in SMO domain uses O1 configuration of near-RT RIC to set up a desired “background near-RT RIC behavior”.  In this mode the near-RT RIC sets up E2 mechanisms to monitor E2 Node and uses Traffic Steering related E2 mechanisms to achieve the desired background behavior of the set of E2 Nodes connected to the near-RT RIC.

“A1-Policy based” Near-RT RIC Processing: This mode may be entered from either Mode 0 or Mode 1.  Non-RT RIC in SMO domain uses A1-P to specify an A1 guided behavior for a targeted subset of E2 Nodes or UEs. If entering this from Mode 1, this will have the effect of modifying the existing near-RT RIC “background” behavior to include a more specific A1 guided behavior.  In this mode, the near-RT RIC may either set up or modify E2 mechanisms used to monitor E2 Nodes and will use Traffic Steering related E2 mechanisms to obtain the desired behavior of some targeted sub-set of E2 Nodes or UEs.  This mode terminates when the corresponding A1-P Policy Delete message is received from Non-RT RIC in SMO domain and the system returns to either Mode 0 or Mode 1, depending on whether or not OAM Functions in SMO domain had previously configured the optional Near-RT RIC “background” role (Mode 1).

Note 1: Processing Mode 0 is strictly not in scope for WG3.  It is described here for completeness and to clearly state what is the starting point prior to the WG2 and WG3 defined mechanisms.

Processing Mode 2 contain an ‘outer loop’ and an ‘inner loop’.  In the inner loop, a number of different “E2 mechanism” may be used (Policy, Report/Control or Insert/Control) towards a number of different target RAN functions in order to either exercise existing RAN mechanisms or modifying their ongoing behavior.  The appropriate mechanism and target RAN Function would depend upon the RAN Function capabilities to support a given E2 mechanism, the A1-P scope and policy, the O1 configuration of the RIC and the performance observed through E2 monitoring.

<<Uses>>

Related use

Goal

Drive traffic management in RAN in accordance with defined intents, policies, and enrichment information from the Non-RT RIC using A1 interface

Actors and Roles

OAM Functions in SMO domain: Performance data and training data collection, AI Model management

Non-RT RIC in SMO domain: Creates and updates A1 policies, AI model training targeting to TS optimization

Near-RT RIC: Enforces A1 policies and generates RIC CONTROL and/or POLICY

E2 Node: RIC CONTROL and POLICY execution and RIC REPORT creation

Refer to 4.1.2 for more details.

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated.

A1, O1 and E2 interface connectivity is established.

A1 Policy scope defined

Pre-conditions

Network is operational with default configuration.

OAM Functions have configured a baseline measurement configuration and the Non-RT RIC has access to this data

(optional) OAM Functions have configured Traffic Steering targets in near-RT RIC through O1 interface

OAM Functions have configured baseline traffic steering parameters in E2 Node(s) through O1 interface

(optional) Near-RT RIC has access to the necessary data related to traffic steering from the E2 node by means of a RIC Report procedure

Non-RT RIC analyzes the historical data from RAN for training the relevant AI/ML models to be deployed or updated in the near-RT RIC, as well as AI/ML models required for non-real-time optimization of configuration and policies.

 Begins when

Non-RT RIC and/or Near-RT RIC perform data evaluation, determine that TS-aware optimization is required to be initiated or updated and establishes target(s).

Step 1 (O)

(Start of Outer loop control)

Non-RT RIC evaluates the collected data and A1 policy feedback, if required, and generates or updates the appropriate TS-aware resource optimization policy, such as TS targets, and sends it to Near-RT RIC via A1 interface.

Step 2 (O)

Non-RT RIC sends optional traffic steering related A1 Enrichment Information

Step 3 (M)

Based on received A1 policy and/or A1-EI from Non-RT RIC or internal trigger and/or internal evaluation and trigger, Near-RT RIC sets up or updates the TS-aware resource optimization procedure.

Step 4 (M)

Near-RT RIC subscribes to a UE context information and measurement metrics via E2 interface.

Step 5 (M)

(Start of Inner loop control)

E2 Nodes report the UE context information and E2 measurements via RIC REPORT periodically or event-triggered.

Step 6 (M)

Near-RT RIC evaluates the performance data from E2 Nodes (including performance data from different E2 Nodes for the same UE) and finds the performance is out of TS targets which are indicated in the A1 policy and/or internal near-RT RIC TS targets.

Step 7 (M)

Based on the UE context information, E2 measurement metrics (RIC REPORT), and A1 policy, Near-RT RIC may generate new or modify the existing E2 policies and sends them to E2 Nodes. Near-RT RIC may also generate control command(s) and send them to E2 Node(s) to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that TS indicators can move back to the limits outlined in the A1 policies.

E2 node functions target of E2 policy and control commands may be:

E-UTRAN-NR Dual Connectivity

Carrier Aggregation

Connected mode mobility

Idle Mode Mobility

Step 4 to Step 7 may repeat. (End of Inner loop control)

Step 8 (O)

If required, Near-RT RIC sends information to the SMO domain using A1 policy feedback and/or O1-PM.  The Non-RT RIC may use this information and information collected from E2 Nodes using O1-PM as policy feedback to assess the performance of TS optimization function in Near-RT RIC, or to assess the outcome of the applied A1 policies. Subsequently, an A1 policy can be updated.

In parallel, the Near-RT RIC may use available information to assess the performance of TS optimization function in Near-RT RIC, and/or to assess the outcome of the applied A1 policies. Subsequently, Near-RT RIC TS optimization targets can be updated

Step 1 to Step 8 may repeat (End of Outer loop control)

Ends when

Non-RT RIC decides to delete TS-aware resource optimization policy and sends the related message or following internal trigger, the Near-RT RIC terminates the TS-aware resource optimization procedure.

Exceptions

None

Post Conditions

Non-RT RIC continues to collect and monitor TS related measurement data from E2 Node.

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the Traffic Steering use case. The requirements are specified in Section 5.

4.1.4.1	Control over E2

Mobility Control: serving cell can be chosen based on the resource status and QoS of the UE(s) targeted by an A1 Traffic steering policy. Moreover, load balancing can be achieved to improve the overall network performance. The following procedures can be used for Traffic Steering:

Handover from the source cell to the target cell

Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list

Configuration of idle mode mobility parameters

Enable, disable, or modify CA (3GPP TS 38.300 [14], 3GPP TS 36.300 [8], 3GPP TS 38.473 [21], 3GPP TS 38.331 [18], 3GPP TS 36.331 [11])

Enable, disable, or modify Dual Connectivity (3GPP TS 38.300 [14], 3GPP TS 36.300 [8], 3GPP TS 37.340 [13], 3GPP TS 38.473 [21], 3GPP TS 38.331 [18], 3GPP TS 36.331 [11])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

4.1.4.2	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID (as defined in [23])

Slice level: S-NSSAI

DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.

QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).

UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used to derive the QoS requirements and the resource occupation; the UE capabilities may be required to select the appropriate RRM action (e.g., CA/DC configuration).

4.1.4.3	Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the Traffic Steering use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g., handover control, DC, CA, idle mode mobility) by taking into account the RAN resource utilization, cell level and the UE level performance, the radio conditions, etc.

	The following lists the examples of measurement information identified as required:

4.1.4.4	E2 node Configuration

Cell level configuration parameters, such as PCI, neighbor relations and related offsets etc. are needed at Near-RT RIC in order to e.g., configure UE measurements monitor cell level performance and manage mobility control (handover and cell reselection) according to the network topology and the related E2 parameters.

4.2	Use case 2: QoS Based Resource Optimization

This use case provides the background and motivation for the O-RAN architecture to support near real-time QoS aware resource optimization.

Based on the end-to-end requirements for the QoS based resource optimization use case defined in [23] section 3.8, some high-level functional descriptions and requirements over Near-RT RIC and E2 interface are introduced.

4.2.1	Background and goal of the use case

The network must offer means to prioritize resources while preserving the required QoS properties, e.g., reliability, latency, bandwidth requirements, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2]. Current RAN network coverage and capacity depends on rigorous planning and configuration. However, due to varying nature of traffic demands and radio channels as well as multiple services to co-exist, it is hard to satisfy all QoS requirements simultaneously.

In summary, it is important for an E2 Node to achieve QoS targets as smoothly as possible. The QoS aware resource optimization should provide a refined granularity of radio resource allocation based on varying radio conditions and traffics in order to meet the diverse requirements of reliability, latency, and bandwidth simultaneously. In addition, it should coordinate allocation of radio resources for co-existing multiple services, which may have different priorities, to achieve the optimal utilization of radio resources.

In case when the network performance data is observed outside the boundary of the defined QoS targets, the Near-RT RIC should be able to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that the QoS indicators can move back within limits outlined in the A1 policies.

4.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

OAM Functions in SMO domain:

Collect necessary measurement metrics from network level measurement report and enrichment data (may acquire data from application) for constructing/training relevant AI/ML models

Deploy or update, configure the relevant QoS optimization AI/ML models to Near-RT RIC via O1.

Goal

QoS-aware resource optimization in E2 Nodes in accordance with A1 policies and O1 configuration.

Actors and Roles

OAM Functions in SMO domain: Performance data and training data collection, AI Model training targeting to QoS optimization

Non-RT RIC in SMO domain: Creates and updates A1 policies

Near-RT RIC: Enforces A1 policies and generates RIC CONTROL and/or POLICY

E2 Node: RIC CONTROL and POLICY execution and RIC REPORT creation

Refer to 4.2.2 for more details.

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated and configured.

A1, O1, E2 interface connectivity is established.

Pre-conditions

Network is operational with default configuration.

OAM Functions have established RAN data collection, and Non-RT RIC has access to this data.

Non-RT RIC analyzes the history data from RAN and triggers SMO to train the relevant AI/ML models which are deployed or updated in Near-RT RIC via O1 interface.

Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC have exchanged capabilities for the support of QoS-aware resource optimization.

Begins when

QoS-aware optimization policy is required to be initiated or updated.

Step 1 (O)

(Start of Outer loop control)

Non-RT RIC evaluates the collected data and A1 policy feedback, if required, and generates or updates the appropriate QoS-aware resource optimization policy, such as QoS targets, and sends it to Near-RT RIC via A1 interface.

Step 2 (M)

When Near-RT RIC receives an A1 policy from Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC initiates the corresponding optimization procedure.

Step 3 (M)

(Start of Inner loop control)

Near-RT RIC subscribes to a UE context information and measurement metrics via E2 interface.

Step 4 (M)

E2 Nodes report the UE context information and E2 measurements via RIC REPORT periodically or event-triggered.

Step 5 (M)

Near-RT RIC evaluates the performance data from E2 Nodes (including performance data from different E2 Nodes for the same UE) and finds the performance is out of QoS targets which are indicated in the A1 policy. If performance is within the targets, Near-RT RIC keeps monitoring.

Step 6 (M)

Based on the UE context information, E2 measurement metrics (RIC REPORT), and A1 policy, Near-RT RIC may generate new or modify the existing E2 policies and sends them to E2 Nodes. Near-RT RIC may also generate control command(s) and send them to E2 Node(s) to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that QoS indicators can move back to the limits outlined in the A1 policies.

Step 3 to Step 6 may repeat. (End of Inner loop control)

Step 7 (O)

If required, Near-RT RIC sends policy feedback to Non-RT RIC to assess the performance of QoS optimization function in Near-RT RIC, or to assess the outcome of the applied A1 policies. Subsequently, an A1 policy can be updated.

Step 1 to Step 7 may repeat (End of Outer loop control)

Ends when

Non-RT RIC decides to delete QoS-aware resource optimization policy and sends the related message to Near-RT RIC.

Exceptions

-

Post Conditions

Non-RT RIC continues to collect and evaluate RAN data related to the QoS-aware optimization use case.

Figure 4.2.3.1-1: The overall procedure for Qos Based Resource Optimization use case

4.2.4	Required data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the QoS based resource optimization use case. The requirements are specified in Section 5.

4.2.4.1	Control over E2

DRB Control: RB control can be applied for modification of the following QoS properties:

DRB QoS modification (TS 38.473 [21], TS 23.501 [3]): The DRB level QoS may be tuned to accommodate A1 policy requirement.

QoS flow remapping (TS 38.473 [21]): The mapping relationship between QoS flows and DRBs may be adjusted.

Logical channel reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): The relevant parameters can be considered, e.g., priority, prioritized bit rate, bucket size duration, etc.

Radio Admission Control (TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): DRB admission control such as reject or release may be applied.

Modification of dual-connectivity DRB (TS 37.340 [13]): change of bearer termination point (MN or SN) and/or bearer types (MCG/SCG/split), and control of split ratio for a split bearer.

Activation and deactivation of packet duplication and configuration of the number of legs in DC, CA, or DC+CA scenarios (TS 36.300 [8], TS 38.300 [14]).

RIC CONTROL (e.g., request for QoS flow remapping) or RIC POLICY (e.g., DRB admission policy) can be applicable.

Radio Resource Allocation, such as configuration of DRX, semi-persistent scheduling (SPS), or guidance for the scheduling and rate selection in MAC. For example, based on prediction, an E2 policy or control to reconfigure SPS configuration or ConfiguredGrantConfig for UL may be generated.

DRX reconfiguration (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): Long DRX cycle length, Short DRX cycle length as well as short DRX cycle timer can be considered.

SR periodicity reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): Both sr-ProhibitTimer and sr-TransMax can be treated.

SPS configuration (TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): Both SPS-Config (DL) and ConfiguredGrantConfig (UL) can be treated.

Reconfiguration of slice level PRB quota (TS 28.541 [4])

Configuration of CQI table with certain target block error rate (TS 38.214 [15])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used. For example, SPS can be configured via RIC CONTROL; RIC POLICY can be used, e.g., to set the guidance for the scheduler.

Radio Access Control: Depending on operator's policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, and available services, different criterion will be used in determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when congestion occurs in the system, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [1]. For example, access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific cell in order to achieve better QoS for some UEs. A cell-level, UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Four categories of radio access control are indicated as below:

RACH Backoff

RRC Connection Reject

RRC Connection Release

Access Barring

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Connection Mobility Control: For example, a neighbouring cell may be selected for the optimization of QoS of a specific UE. A neighbour handover restriction list may be configured to prevent the UEs from HO to some neighbouring cells in order to guarantee QoS of the UEs served by those neighbouring cells. Or, a capacity boosting mechanism may be used to achieve better QoS, e.g., enable CA/DC.

Handover from the source cell to the target cell

Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list

Enable, disable, or modify CA (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11])

Enable, disable, or modify dual connectivity (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used. For the specific requirements and related stage-3 E2SM works, please refer to the Traffic Steering use case defined in Section 4.1.

4.2.4.2	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID (as defined in [23])

Slice level: S-NSSAI

DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.

QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).

UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities

RLC/MAC/PHY level: e.g., logical channel, DRX, scheduling request, SPS configurations.

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used for different granularity of controls over E2; an established DRB level information may be needed to change the mapping of QoS flows to a specific DRB or modify DRB attributes; the UE capabilities may be required to make sure if CA/DC can be enabled.

4.2.4.3	Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the QoS based resource optimization use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g., RB control, handover, access control) by taking into account the runtime status in the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, it is required to specify those measurement parameters as possible as needed over E2 interface.

4.3	Use case 3: RAN Slice SLA Assurance

The 3GPP standards architected a sliceable 5G infrastructure which allows creation and management of customized networks to meet specific service requirements that may be demanded by future applications, services and business verticals. Such a flexible architecture needs different requirements to be specified in terms of functionality, performance and group of users which may greatly vary from one service to the other. The 5G standardization efforts have gone into defining specific slices and their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on application/service type [1]. Since network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes the core network, the transport network and the radio access network (RAN), these requirements should be met at any slice subnet during the life-time of a network slice [4], especially in RAN side. Exemplary slice performance requirements are defined in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, latency and reliability at a high level in SDOs such as 3GPP [1] and GSMA [22]. These requirements are defined as a reference for SLA/contractual agreements for each slice, which individually need proper handling in NG-RAN.

Although network slicing support is started to be defined with 3GPP Release 15, slice assurance mechanisms in RAN needs to be further addressed to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN environment. It is necessary to assure the SLAs by dynamically controlling slice configurations based on slice specific performance information. Existing RAN performance measurements [6] and information model definitions [5] are not enough to support RAN slice SLA assurance use cases. This use case is intended to clarify necessary mechanisms and parameters for RAN slice SLA assurance.

In the context of the RAN, the SLA assurance parameters sent over the A1 interface help the Near-RT RIC guide the behavior of the E2 Nodes (O-CU-UP, O-CU-CP, O-DU). The Non-RT RIC utilizes the slice SLA information and performance metrics to derive the necessary set of A1 policies and sends those to the Near-RT RICs related to a network slice. Each subtending Near-RT RICs uses these A1 policies for further cell-level and/or UE-level policy guidance and/or control action over the E2 interface that affects the cells and/or UEs, involved in the network slice, served by the respective E2 Nodes. The combined guidance is handled as one or more A1 policies and/or E2 policies and/or E2 control actions. The intention of the SLA assurance parameters in the RAN context is to provide guidance to the E2 Nodes for assuring SLAs of the network slices in the radio access network.

4.3.1	Background and goal of the use case

In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific business requirements. These requirements include customizable network capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G standardization efforts, the 5G system should support the needs of the business through the specification of several service needs such as data rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN’s open interfaces and AI/ML based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

5G Core and O-RAN cooperation for SLA Enforcement

Figure 4.3.1-1: Core & RAN cooperation for SLA enforcement

Figure 4.3.1-1 shows the network functions and components that are related with SLA enforcement within 5G Core (5GC) and O-RAN. Although the 5GC enforces most of the SLA parameters, the components of the 5GC have a comprehensive view of the entire wireless network but from a core perspective. 3GPP Release 17 introduces the concept of a Network Slice Admission Control Function (NSACF). This debuted from the 3GPP TR 23.700-40 Feasibility Study on Enhancement of Network Slicing Phase 2 [i.3], and normative in [31] clause 5.15.11. The purpose of the NSACF is to enforce some of the slice SLA parameters from a 5G Core perspective. While NSACF handles slice-specific user admission control into the network based on GSMA NG.116 [22] GST criterion, the AMF allows the UE to access slice(s) through S-NSSAI or NSSAI requests through NSACF interaction. Together, they can perform network-level policy enforcement. However, these components do not have the detailed knowledge of RAN, such as RAN resources usage or where specific UEs are geographically located within a gNB. These 5GC components can perform only at a “network view” and they also do not have control over RAN resources.

O-RAN SLA assurance is independent of and complements 5GC SLA policy enforcement. Within the RAN, the Near-RT RIC provides unique SLA policy actions within the scope of E2 Nodes based on the A1 policy guidance received from the Non-RT RIC.

Non-RT RIC & Near-RT RIC provide RAN guidance for SLA objectives

Figure 4.3.1-2: Non-RT RIC & Near-RT RIC RAN Guidance

As Figure 4.3.1-2 shows, the Non-Real Time RIC obtains the SLA parameters from SMO. The Non-RT RIC has a system level view of RAN topology, configuration and performance, so rApps can provide ongoing guidance and decompose SLA objects to the sub-tending Near-RT RICs. The Non-RT RIC then translates the SLA parameters into SLA objective A1 policies to its subtending Near-RT RIC(s). In some cases, the SLA parameters are already RAN or UE specific. Those SLA parameters would then not need any change in their values and would be “passed-through” to the Near-RT RIC(s) in A1 policies.

The Near-RT RICs obtain the SLA objectives via A1 policies from the Non-RT RIC. The Near-RT RIC can provide cell-level and/or UE-level guidance or control to the E2 Nodes to achieve SLA assurance enforcement at the RAN level. The E2 Nodes receive guidance or control from their respective Near-RT RICs. There are GSMA GST/NEST NG.116 [22] parameters, such as the Downlink and Uplink Throughput Per Network Slice, that have both Core and RAN applicability.

For example, the Downlink and Uplink Throughput Per Network Slice may be used by 5GC network functions; and the Non-RT RIC can calculate maxUlThptPerSlice and maxDlThptPerSlice parameters in an A1 policy which will then be used by the Near-RT RIC as target values via monitoring E2 Node performance and, where required, requesting appropriate E2 services (CONTROL and/or POLICY) to provide guidance to the E2 Nodes

<<Uses>>

Related use

Goal

RAN Slice SLA assurance

Actors and Roles

SMO Functions, Non-RT RIC Framework, Near-RT RIC, E2 Nodes

Assumptions

All relevant functions and components are instantiated.

A1, O1, E2 interface connectivity is established.

Pre-conditions

Near-RT RIC and Non-RT RIC are instantiated with A1 interface connectivity being established between them.

O1 interfaces are established between SMO and Near-RT RIC, and SMO and E2 nodes.

RAN slice SLA assurance applications have been deployed in Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC respectively.

Begins when

A RAN slice is activated or an operator defined trigger is detected

Step 1 (M)

OAM Functions may configure baseline Slice SLA Assurance parameters in E2 Node(s) through O1 interface.

OAM Functions collects data from E2 node through O1 interface.

Step 2 (M)

RAN Slice SLA assurance rApp retrieves relevant information from Non-RT RIC Framework, such as active RAN slices (such as active S-NSSAIs, network slice subnet instances, topology), RAN Slice SLA information, NF configuration etc.

Step 3 (M)

RAN Slice SLA assurance rApp monitors and evaluates performance of RAN slices which may include detection of possible RAN Slice SLA violation.

Step 4 (M)

RAN Slice SLA assurance rApp decides to apply A1 policy-based RAN slice SLA assurance considering RAN slice SLA requirements and/or operator-defined RAN intents, EI from external application servers and O1 based long term trends. In addition to these input parameters, A1 feedback from Near-RT RIC, when available, can be utilized for updating existing policies.

Step 5 (M)

(Start of Inner loop control)

Near-RT RIC subscribes to a UE context information and measurement metrics via E2 interface.

Step 6 (M)

E2 Nodes report the UE context information and E2 measurements via RIC REPORT periodically or event-triggered.

Step 7 (M)

Near-RT RIC evaluates the performance data from E2 Nodes (including performance data from different E2 Nodes for the same UE) and finds the performance is out of Slice SLA targets which are indicated in the A1 policy and/or internal near-RT RIC Slice SLA targets.

Step 8 (M)

Based on the UE context information, E2 measurement metrics (RIC REPORT), and A1 policy, Near-RT RIC may generate new or modify the existing E2 policies and sends them to E2 Nodes.

Near-RT RIC may also generate control command(s) and send them to E2 Node(s) to trigger re-allocation of radio resources so that Slice SLA indicators can move back to the limits outlined in the A1 policies.

Step 9 (O)

	Near RT-RIC may send A1 Policy feedback on A1 to the Non-RT RIC.

Step 10 (O)

	Non-RT RIC decides to delete Slice SLA Assurance policy and sends the related message or following internal trigger, the Near-RT RIC terminates the Slice SLA Assurance procedure.

Ends when

RAN slice(s) is deactivated or an operator defined trigger is detected

Exceptions

None identified

Post Conditions

SLA assurance for RAN Slice(s) over a period of time is achieved

4.3.4	Required data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the Slice SLA Assurance use case. The requirements are specified in Section 5.

4.3.4.1	Control over E2

Radio Resource Allocation, such as configuration of slice level PRB quota or per-cell-per-slice/QoS frequency partitions. For example, based on prediction, an E2 policy or control to reconfigure slice level PRB may be generated. Another example is, based on analysis of slice level interference among cells in terms of the reliability requirement, an E2 control to reconfigure frequency partitions may be generated.

Configuration and/or reconfiguration of slice level PRB quota (TS 28.541 [4])

Configuration and/or reconfiguration of per-cell-per-slice/QoS frequency partitions

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Radio Access Control: Depending on operator's policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles, available services and SLA of slice, different criterion will be used in determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when congestion occurs in the system, as specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [1]. For example, access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific slice in order to achieve better SLA for some slice. A UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Three categories of radio access control are indicated as below:

RRC Connection Reject

RRC Connection Release

Access Barring

4.3.4.2	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID

Slice level: S-NSSAI

QoS level: 5QI

UE-level RAN state information

UE-level PM data

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI and 5QI can be used to derive the resource occupation of each slice.

4.3.4.3	Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the Slice SLA Assurance use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g., PRB control, access control) by taking into account the runtime status in the Near-RT RIC. Therefore, it is required to specify those measurement parameters as possible as needed over E2 interface.

The following lists the examples of cell-level measurement information identified as required:

4.4.3.2	Beam-based Mobility Robustness Optimization (bMRO)

Beam-based Mobility Robustness Optimization (bMRO) is an autonomous self-optimizing algorithm that improves beam-based inter-cell mobility performance by applying beam-specific HO parameters including Cell Individual Offsets (CIO), Time to Trigger (TTT), T310 counter, etc. on the handover configuration between neighbor cells, based on the analysis of beam-specific mobility-related counters and/or mobility failure events. bMRO is capable to reduce the number of unnecessary handovers, handover failures as well as ping-pong handovers particularly in cells that cover areas with different mobility characteristics. Performance, complexity and gain analysis has been provided in [i.2, section 3.3]. Signaling overhead and complexity (RRC re-configuration, mobility reporting and O-CU reconfiguration messages) can be further reduced by beam grouping in which case beams with similar mobility characteristics comprise a beam group (e.g., group 1: low mobility pedestrian area, group 2: high mobility street). Mobility reports consist of aggregated mobility KPI/PMs (e.g., number of too early HOs, number of too late HOs, number of HO to wrong cell) or individual failure reports with root cause (e.g., to early HO, too late HO, HO to wrong cell) or a combination of the two. Reports are sent per each SSB beam or SSB beam group towards each neighbor cell. Individual mobility failure reports will also be reported per UE to allow UE or UE group-based optimization (besides beam or beam group specific reporting). While aggregated mobility KPIs/PMs are used for slow adaptations (e.g., 5 min), individual failure reports are used for faster adaptations (e.g., 100 ms) or for AI/ML based analysis of failure patterns. Measurement reporting periodicity and measurement type are configurable on a per cell basis considering the tradeoff between gain in mobility performance and associated signaling overhead. Mobility KPIs and failure events are forwarded from the O-CU to the Near-RT RIC, and the near-RT RIC configures the CIO and the measurement reporting in the O-CUs. CIOs might be beam- or beam group-based and can also be configurable per UE group (e.g., UE type, UE mobility or UE mode such as energy saving mode).

While AI/ML based approaches are not mandated, AI/ML methods/models can be used i) to build beam groups, to ii) decide on cell individual measurement configuration, to iii) detect changes in mobility characteristics (e.g., traffic jam) that trigger optimization, to iv) group UEs in UE groups as well as v) for the bMRO optimization algorithm itself to calculate the optimal cell individual offsets. In case of dynamic beam pattern optimization, relevant mMIMO beam pattern information must be available at the Near-RT RIC, e.g., mobility reports might indicate a specific beam pattern.

4.5	Use case 5: QoE Optimization

Based on the end-to-end requirements for the QoE optimization use case defined in [23] section 3.4 and [28] section 3.2, some high-level functional description and requirements over Near-RT RIC and E2 interface are introduced.

4.5.1	Background and goal of the use case

The highly demanding 5G native applications like Cloud VR are both bandwidth consuming and latency sensitive. However, for such traffic-intensive and highly interactive applications, current semi-static QoS framework can be insufficient to satisfy diversified QoE requirements especially taking into account potentially significant fluctuation of radio transmission capability. It is expected that QoE estimation/prediction can help deal with such uncertainty and improve the efficiency of radio resources, and eventually improve user experience. RAN analytics information (RAI) as RAN service can be exposed to RAI service consumers for specific UE (identified according to [30] section 4.5) or for groups of UE (per slice, per cell, per PLMN, etc.). RAI is envisioned to be helpful for the applications to improve the user experience.

Near-RT RIC and E2 interface are leveraged to support this use case. Measurement data through E2 interface, e.g., cell level data, UE level data, can be acquired and processed via ML algorithms to support traffic recognition, QoE prediction, and QoS enforcement decisions. When requested, the analytics information, e.g., traffic rate, latency, packet loss rate, is exposed to the RAI service consumers to help applications execute logical control.

4.5.2	Entities/resources involved in the use case

Near-RT RIC:

Support receiving request or subscription messages from RAI service consumer.

Support receiving network state and UE performance report from RAN.

Support data analysis and executing the AI/ML models to infer RAN analytics information, e.g., QoE prediction, and available bandwidth prediction.

Support exposure RAN analytics information to RAI service consumer.

RAN:

Support network state and UE performance report with required granularity to Near-RT RIC over E2 interface.

RAI service consumer:

Request or subscribe to RAN analytics information from the Near-RT RIC.

Support UE identification using data structure defined in O-RAN Architecture [30] section 4.

4.5.3	Solutions

4.5.3.0	Introduction

This section specifies solution components that can be combined into different solutions. A solution based on E2 control/policy consists of section 4.5.3.1 and section 4.5.3.2. Another solution based on RAN analytics information exposure consists of section 4.5.3.1 and section 4.5.3.3.

4.5.3.1	AI/ML Model training and distribution

Overall process defined in [28] section 3.2.3.1 “Model training and distribution” however step 3 would be performed over O2 when and if “image based” ML model deployment option is selected (see [29] section 7).

4.5.3.2	Policy generation and performance evaluation

Editor’s note: to be defined based on requirements from [28] section 3.2.4.1.

4.5.3.3	RAN Performance Analytics assisted QoE Optimization

RAN Performance analytics may be requested by the RAI service consumer using either a Request/Response solution or a Subscription Based solution.

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the QoE Optimization use case, especially for RAN Performance Analytics. The requirements are specified in Section 5.

4.5.4.1	UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID

List of S-NSSAI

List of QoS related ID, eg., 5QI, QFI

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI or QoS related ID can be used to collect, analysis and predict the resource occupation of each user, slice or service, eg. maximum/average throughput, maximum/average latency, average packet loss rate.

4.5.4.2	Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the QoE Optimization use case, especially for RAN Performance Analytics, the Near-RT RIC receives the request or subscription from RAI service consumer and subscribes and receives the measurement data from O-CU/O-DU through E2 interface. Based on it, with QoE related AI/ML models, the Near-RT RIC infers the RAN analytics information, and exposes it to RAI service consumer.

4.6	Use case 6: Network Energy Saving

This use case provides the motivation, description, and requirements for Near RT RIC and E2 interface to support Network Energy Saving, whose end-to-end requirements are defined in [32].

The RAN is responsible for the majority of the Energy Consumption (EC) of a mobile network, and the O-RU consumes the largest part of the energy consumption of the RAN. The rarefication of fossil fuel-based energy resources and the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions make energy saving a strategic goal for network operators, in addition to the significant energy related OPEX reduction requirement.

Energy consumption can be reduced by improving the Energy Efficiency (EE) of the network, and by introducing different Energy Saving (ES) mechanisms. Several ES mechanisms are related to switching off certain components in the network and differ from one another by their time scale. In a longer time-scale of minutes, hours and above, and when the cell load is low, ES can be achieved by switching off one or more carriers or the cell itself. At the same or shorter time-scale, from seconds to minutes, ES can be achieved by switching off RF channels (including possibly array of antennas) of a Massive-MIMO (mMIMO) system. At a shorter time-scale corresponding to a symbol, subframe and frame, Advanced Sleep Modes (ASM) can be considered [i.4] - [33].

The ES use cases are divided into three sub-use cases, which have different properties, the time scale of the control and the controlled system involved:

Carrier and cell switch off/on.

RF channel reconfiguration.

Advanced Sleep Modes

4.6.1	Carrier and Cell Switch Off/On

4.6.1.1 Background and goal of the use case

Carrier and cell switch off/on control by the Non-RT or Near-RT RIC can consider overall network energy efficiency instead of local optimization. In addition to the ES optimization in the SMO/Non-RT RIC, optimizing network EC in the Near-RT RIC brings significant gains due to more UE centric, near real-time intelligent control capabilities with finer granularity. The AI/ML models' functionality in the Near-RT RIC may include prediction of future traffic, user mobility, resource usage, QoS and QoE on a per UE basis and may also predict expected energy efficiency enhancements, resource usage, and network performance for different carrier and cell switching off/on options. Based on the predicted results, optimized ES control actions or policies can be given by the Near-RT RIC to E2 nodes in near real-time manner to track the dynamic network conditions. ES control also includes preparation actions (before carrier and cells are switched off)  and post control actions (after carrier and cells are switched on) such as checking ongoing emergency calls and warning messages, enabling/disabling/modifying Carrier Aggregation and/or Dual Connectivity, steering traffic and handing over UEs from source cells/carriers to other cells/carriers, changing MU-MIMO layers, beam scheduling policies and SSB burst configurations etc, which can be handled in the Near-RT RIC by the intelligent and UE centric RAN control capabilities coordinated with the SMO/Non-RT RIC.

The goal of Near-RT RIC Energy Saving is to interpret the policies received over A1 and to determine the optimum changes it can make according to these policies. More specifically, Near-RT RIC triggers E2 procedure and related control/policies so as to obtain network performance that would fulfill the criteria identified in the A1 policies. It may also leverage the A1 enrichment information to make more informed decisions. Traffic Steering may reuse mechanisms provided by other use cases to affect the changes necessary to achieve its goals. The Near-RT RIC may also work in Background Processing without the A1 Policy guidance from the Non-RT RIC.

4.6.1.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case

Near-RT RIC:

Near real-time monitoring of Energy Saving related performance measurements.

Receive Energy Saving xApps from SMO.

Support interpretation and enforcement of A1 policies from Non-RT RIC.

Support enrichment information via the A1 interface.

Perform optimized RAN (E2) actions to achieve ES requirements based on O1 configuration, A1 policy, A1 enrichment information and E2 reports.

E2 node:

Support ES optimization actions or policy enforcements via E2.

Support ES related performance measurements through O1.

Support ES related performance reports through E2.

4.6.1.3 Solution

There are three general ES processing modes and the transitions between them.  The three processing modes, Baseline, Background and A1 Policy based, as described in clause 4.1.3 for Traffic Steering use case applies to the Energy Saving use case as is except that the modes represent the way the Near-RT RIC operates on a given E2 node rather than UE specific.

4.6.1.4 Required data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the ES Carrier and Cell Switch Off/On use case. The requirements are specified in Section 5.

4.6.1.4.1 Control over E2

Radio Access Control: Access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific cell in order to prepare for switching off the cell to save energy. A cell-level, UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Four categories of radio access control are indicated as below:

RACH Backoff

RRC Connection Reject

RRC Connection Release

Access Barring

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Mobility Control: For example, a neighbouring cell may be selected in order to switch off the current serving cell. A neighbour handover restriction list may be configured to prevent the UEs from HO to some neighbour cells in order to reduce traffic load of the neighbour cells and switch them off.

Handover from the source cell to the target cell

Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list

Configuration of idle mode mobility parameters

Enable, disable, or modify CA (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11])

Enable, disable, or modify dual connectivity (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Carriers and Cell Switch off/on Control: Depending on the traffic condition, certain number of carriers and cells can be switched off by the Near-RT RIC by sending guidance to the E2 node when the traffic is low in order to save energy.

Note: Once E2 node receives the guidance from Near-RT RIC for switching off/on a cell/carrier, it is not expected that the cell/carrier can be switched off immediately. The E2 node may take time to do all necessary actions to prepare for switching off/on the carrier/cell and there is also a delay in O-RU and Open Fronthaul interface for switching off/on the cell/carrier. However, it is still expected [32] that the Near-RT RIC to send this intent to the E2 node to start the process for cell/carrier switching off/on after the network performance and energy efficiency are jointly optimized through for example traffic steering and QoS/QoE optimisation by the Near-RT RIC through 1) and 2). The E2 node (e.g., O-CU-CP) can optionally do traffic steering and OoS optimisation upon receiving this command from the Near-RT RIC before triggering the cell/carrier switching off/on.

Either RIC POLICY or RIC CONTROL can be used which is FFS.

4.6.1.4.2 UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

The followings are examples of UE context information identified as required:

UE ID (as defined in [23])

Slice level: S-NSSAI

DRB level: e.g., established DRB ID, mapping with QoS flows, etc.

QoS related: e.g., E-RAB Level QoS Parameters (4G, NSA) or QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters (NG-RAN).

UE capabilities: CA and DC capabilities

For example, UE ID, S-NSSAI, DRB ID, or QCI/5QI can be used to derive the QoS requirements and the resource occupation; the UE capabilities may be required to select the appropriate RRM action (e.g., CA/DC configuration).

4.6.1.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes

	The E2 measurements are necessary for inference and prediction in the Near-RT RIC as the driver for decisions in addition to KPMs. For the Energy Saving Carrier and Cell switch off/on use case, the Near-RT RIC can translate an A1 policy (relatively static targets) into a flexible selection of controls over E2 (e.g., handover control, DC, CA, idle mode mobility, carrier and cell switching off/on) by taking into account the RAN resource utilization, cell level and the UE level performance, the radio and traffic conditions, QoS and QoE requirements and energy consumption and efficiency etc.

	The following lists the examples of measurement information identified as required:

4.6.2	Advanced Sleep Mode

4.6.2.1 Background and goal of the use case

During DL transmission or UL reception, certain O-RU components (e.g., PA, LNA and baseband etc) can be powered off during blank OFDM symbols and slots. For power saving at the symbol level, PA and LNA can be turned off since their transition period (on to off and off to on) can be in a few microseconds (micro sleep). For power saving at slot level, additional HW can be turned off to save more energy if the transition time allowed is in a few milliseconds (light sleep). For power saving at frame level, even more HW can be turned off (e.g., only maintain O-RU M-plane processing) however higher transition delay, in 100 msec, shall be expected.  For micro and light sleeps, Near-RT RIC can play important roles which based on AI/ML solutions can help to create more sleeping opportunities in the E2 nodes to save energy by e.g., steering traffic, influencing traffic shaping/scheduling, and adjusting common channel (SS/RS) configurations etc. For deep sleeps, where traffic prediction and more capacity, coverage, accessibility and QoS/QoE impacts awareness is needed because of the long-term traffic interruption (e.g., >100ms), Near-RT RIC is the sensible place to guide the system into deep mode due to the rich UE centric data and AI/ML solutions available in the Near-RT RIC.

The goal of Near-RT RIC Energy Saving is to interpret the policies received over A1 and to determine the optimum changes it can make according to these policies. More specifically, Near-RT RIC triggers E2 procedure and related control/policies so as to obtain network performance that would fulfill the criteria identified in the A1 policies. It may also leverage the A1 enrichment information to make more informed decisions. Traffic Steering may reuse mechanisms provided by other use cases to affect the changes necessary to achieve its goals. The Near-RT RIC may also work in Background Processing without the A1 Policy guidance from the Non-RT RIC.

Figure 4.6.2.3-1: Energy Saving ASM Optimization

4.6.2.4 Required Data

This section elaborates the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node capabilities necessary for implementation of the ES ASM use case. The requirements are specified in Section 5.

4.6.2.4.1 Control over E2

Radio Access Control: Access control may be applied to restrict access of other UEs for a specific cell in order to create more sleeping opportunities for the cell. A cell-level, UE-level, or slice-level access control can be applied. Four categories of radio access control are indicated as below:

RACH Backoff

RRC Connection Reject

RRC Connection Release

Access Barring

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

Mobility Control: In order to reduce traffic load to create more sleeping opportunities on the targeted cells, serving cell can be chosen based on the resource status and QoS of the UE(s) and a neighbour handover restriction list may be configured to prevent the UEs from HO to some neighbour cells. The following procedures can be used for mobility control:

Handover from the source cell to the target cell

Configuration/reconfiguration of handover restriction list

Configuration of idle mode mobility parameters

Enable, disable, or modify CA (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11])

Enable, disable, or modify dual connectivity (TS 38.473 [21], TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11])

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

NES related Radio Resource Control: such as configuration common channel periodicities and semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) to create more sleep opportunities including the following types of configurations:

SR periodicity reconfiguration (TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): Both sr-ProhibitTimer and sr-TransMax can be treated.

SPS configuration (TS 38.331 [18], TS 36.331 [11]): Both SPS-Config (DL) and ConfiguredGrantConfig (UL) can be treated.

CSI-RS periodicity configurations.

Common channel periodicity configurations.

NOTE: UE DTX/DRX slots overwrite the SR and SPS configurations since during DTX/DRX, SR and SPS transmission will be deactivated. SSB periodicity may be reconfigured by the Near-RT RIC (if the capability is exposed by the E2 node) on some cells such that the O-RU can have longer sleep duration which enables deeper sleep (more hardware components can be switched off) to save energy, however, the performance impact to UEs needs to be taken care by the operator and xApp/E2 node vendors.

Both RIC POLICY and RIC CONTROL can be used.

ASM Mode Objectives: configuration of ASM mode objectives to the E2 node which may include:

Energy saving target, e.g., targeted energy saving in percentage of current average energy consumption or energy saving levels (e.g., maximum energy saving, medium energy saving, maximum performance etc.).

UE or cell level performance targets, e.g., throughput cap, throughput drop tolerance, latency target.

Preferred Sleep Mode as per clause 20.4.1 of [35], sleep-mode-type of asm-capability-info.

Either RIC POLICY or RIC CONTROL can be used.

NOTE: After the objectives are configured, the E2 node shall try to achieve the objectives, however, whether the objectives can be met depends on the real traffic conditions and E2 node implementations. The E2 Node reports if the ASM Performance Objective is applied and taken into operation. The E2 node also reports the related KPIs, as defined in clause 4.6.1.4.3, for Near-RT RIC to assess the performance changes comparing against the objectives and make further optimisation actions.

5)    Sleep Mode Configuration: depending on the current and predicted future traffic conditions, the Near-RT RIC may guide O-DU to move the carriers into sleep mode. Following the guidance, O-DU may decide to disable (“move to sleep mode”) array carriers, tx-arrays or rx-arrays or the whole O-RU accordingly via the O-FH C-plane in order to save energy [34], Table 7.4.6-7. The guided configurations may include:

Indication of the slot numbers, symbol numbers and the conditions for the sleep mode configuration to be applied.

The Sleep Mode (see [35], clause 20.4.1, sleep-mode-type of asm-capability-info) to be applied during the sleep period indicated in 1 above.

Either RIC POLICY or RIC CONTROL can be used.

NOTE: After the configuration, the E2 node shall try to achieve the configured sleep mode behaviour if the conditions are met, however, it is up to the E2 node to decide when and whether the configuration can be applied depending on the on-going traffic conditions within the E2 node. The E2 Node reports if the sleep mode configuration is applied. The E2 node also report the related KPIs, as defined in clause 4.6.1.4.3, for Near-RT RIC to assess the performance changes comparing against the objectives and make further optimisation actions.

4.6.2.4.2 UE Context Information from E2 Nodes

See clause 4.6.1.4.2.

4.6.2.4.3 Measurements from E2 Nodes

See clause 4.6.1.4.3

4.6.2.4.4 E2 node Configuration

Cell level configuration parameters in order to configure UE measurements required for traffic steering and QoS/QoE optimization (see clause 4.1.4.4) for creating more sleeping opportunities to save energy while maintaining acceptable performance.

O-RU and O-DU Advanced Sleep Mode capabilities, see [35] clause 20.4.1, asm-capability-info, along with information about the mapping from cells to sector carriers and to O-RU are retrieved from O-DU in order to generate applicable and optimized energy saving related policies and controls.

Annex A (informative):
Example Use Cases

A.1	Example Use Cases for RAN Slice SLA Assurance

A.1.1	Downlink and Uplink Throughput Per Slice

The Downlink and Uplink Throughput Per Network Slice are NG.116 attributes used in the definition and deployment of a network slice. They become maxDlThptPerSlice and maxUlThptPerSlice parameters in A1 Polic(ies). The maximum downlink throughput per slice defines the aggregated data rate in the downlink for all UEs together in the network slice. This parameter is defined in GSMA GST NEST NG.116 Downlink throughput per network slice in clause 3.4.5 [22]. See also 3GPP TS28.541 [5] clause 6.3.4 which defines the SliceProfile that captures some of the parameters from GSMA depending on the slice type. The parameter places an upper limit on the capacity of the slice so that the slice does not over-utilize available network resources and thereby provides a target to guide resource utilization.

The following explanation describes the relevance to the Near-RT RIC. These attributes are sent by the Non-RT RIC to the Near-RT RIC(s) together with the scope identifier (S-NSSAI) and optional Cell List or Tracking Area List. The Near-RT RICs split the A1 Policy guidance from the Non-RT RIC. Thus, the subtending Near-RT RICs each provide guidance to the cells of their E2 Nodes (O-DU, O-CU-UP, O-CU-CP) involved in the slice.

For example, suppose there is an SLA parameter, Downlink throughput per network slice, with a value of 600,000 kilobits per second (kbps). The Non-RT RIC in this case has three sub-tending Near-RT RICs. Then, the Non-RT RIC might split the SLA parameter of 600,000 kbps into three A1 Policies: maxDlThptPerSlice = 120,000 kbps for Near-RT RIC #1; maxDlThptPerSlice = 180,000 kbps for Near-RT RIC #2, and maxDlThptPerSlice = 300,000 kbps for Near-RT RIC #3 for the respective slice. This example use case can be seen in Figure A.1.1-1.

Figure A.1.1-1: A1 Policy Decomposition Example

The consumer of the maxDlThptPerSlice and maxUlThptPerSlice parameters is the Near-RT RIC via A1 policy. Slice SLA assurance-related xApp(s), within the Near-RT RIC, can apply or utilize this parameter to provide control of throughput within the E2 Nodes. The xApp(s) can utilize E2 interface to adjust throughput-related RAN parameters, such as adjusting PRB allocation levels The Near-RT RIC has influence over the operation of cells in a geographical area. The adjustment of the PRB allocation levels in MAC schedulers directly impact the throughput achieved by the slice. Therefore, this parameter at the RAN level influences the throughput. There might be other throughput-related parameters that could be employed, such as MCS, which is left for future study.

3GPP Release 17 will introduce the concept of a Network Slice Admission Control Function (NSACF), see reference [(TR23.700-40 S2-1908583)] and reference [(TS23.501 v17.1.1 clause 5.15.11)]. The purpose of the NSACF is to enforce some of the slice SLA parameters from a 5G Core perspective. The NSACF handles slice-specific user admission control into the network based on NG.116 criterion. However, the NSACF has no knowledge of RAN and RAN resources; thus, it cannot control RAN resources. Therefore, there is no interaction between NSACF and the handling of these parameters by the Near-RT RIC. Thus, the usage of the SLA-related parameters by the Near-RT RIC xApp(s) are in the scope of gNBs and will complement the 5GC SLA enforcement but from the perspective of the RAN.

A.1.2	Guaranteed Downlink and Uplink Throughput Per Slice

The Guaranteed Downlink Throughput Quota and Guaranteed Uplink Throughput Quota are attributes used in the definition and deployment of a network slice in NG.116. They are used in A1 Policies as guaDlThptPerSlice and guaUlThptPerSlice. The guaranteed downlink/uplink throughput quota describes the guaranteed throughput or data rate supported by the network slice for the aggregate of all GBR QoS flows in downlink/uplink belonging to the set of all UEs using the network slice. This parameter is defined in GSMA GST NEST NG.116 Downlink/Uplink throughput per network slice in clause 3.4.5 [22]. See also 3GPP TS28.541 clause 6.3.4 [5] which defines the SliceProfile which captures some of the parameters from GSMA depending on the slice type. The Maximum Ul/Dl Throughput per Network Slice parameters (section 3.3.3.1.1) place an upper limit on the capacity of the slice while the Guaranteed Ul/Dl Throughput Quota parameters ensure a certain level of throughput. Thus, these two parameters complement each other: one giving a lower bound and the other giving an upper bound. For the upper bound (Maximum Ul/Dl Throughput per Network Slice) this ensures that the slice does not over-utilize available network resources while for the lower bound (Guaranteed Dl/Ul Throughput Quota) meets a minimum throughput for the slice.

These attributes are sent by the Non-RT RIC to the Near-RT RIC(s) together with the scope identifier (S-NSSAI) and optional Cell List or Tracking Area List. The Near-RT RICs split the A1 Policy guidance from the Non-RT RIC. Thus, the subtending Near-RT RICs each provide guidance to the cells of the E2 Nodes (O-DU, O-CU-UP, O-CU-CP) involved in the slice.

For example, suppose there is an SLA parameter, Guaranteed Uplink Throughput Quota, with a value of 1,000,000 kilobits per second (kbps). The Non-RT RIC in this case has three sub-tending Near-RT RICs. Then, the Non-RT RIC might split the SLA parameter of 1,000,000 kbps into three A1 Policies: guaUlThptPerSlice = 170,000 kbps for Near-RT RIC #1; guaUlThptPerSlice = 230,000 kbps for Near-RT RIC #2, and guaUlThptPerSlice = 600,000 kbps for Near-RT RIC #3 for the respective slice.

The consumer of the guaUlThptPerSlice and guaDlThptPerSlice parameters is the Near-RT RIC via A1 policy. Slice SLA assurance-related xApp(s), within the Near-RT RIC, can apply or utilize this parameter to provide control of and throughput within the E2 Nodes (O-CU-UP, O-CU-CP, O-DU). The xApp(s) can utilize E2 interface to adjust throughput-related RAN parameters, such as adjusting PRB allocation levels. The Near-RT RIC has influence over the operation of cells in a geographical area. The adjustment of the PRB allocation levels in MAC schedulers directly impacts the throughput achieved by the slice. Therefore, this parameter at the RAN level influences the throughput. There might be other throughput-related parameters that could be employed, such as MCS, which is left for future study.
