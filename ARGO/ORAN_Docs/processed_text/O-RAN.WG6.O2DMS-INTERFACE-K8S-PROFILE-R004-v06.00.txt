2 O2dms Service Overview 
2.1 Overview 
This document specifies NF Deployment lifecycle management services offered over the O2dms interface using the 
Kubernetes native APIs, objects, and data model. The relationship with O2ims services is also described whenever 
applicable (e.g., provisioning of Kubernetes labels in an O-Cloud Kubernetes cluster by SMO to enable matching the 
NF Deployment’s requirements with the capabilities of the Kubernetes cluster ).  
The O2dms Kubernetes profile exposes a set of capabilities of the Kubernetes native “API Server” function to the SMO 
and enables the reuse of Kubernetes native API procedures and data model (Kubernetes resource manifests). As depicted 
in Figure 2.1-1, the O2dms Kubernetes profile exposes one O2dms interface instance per one Kubernetes cluster to the 
SMO and the interface is terminated by the API Server component of Kubernetes native control plane. The address  and 
access credentials required for communication with the Kubernetes  API Server component are assumed to be available 
to the SMO. 
 
Figure 2.1-1 
2.2 Supported Use Cases 
The list of orchestration use-cases specified in [2] needs to be supported using O2dms capabilities for NF Deployment 
lifecycle managment. This version of the O2dms Kubernetes profile supports the following use cases aligned with [2] 
based on Kubernetes native APIs and resource objects.  
• Instantiate NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster: This O2dms capability enables the SMO to instantiate an 
NF Deployment on a target Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes native resource objects (e.g., 
Deployments, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, etc.). The set of Kubernetes native resource objects profiled in clause 
4.3 of the present document may be used for NF Deployment. 
• Terminate NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster: This O2dms capability enables the SMO to terminate a n 
NF Deployment on a target Kubernetes cluster by deleting all the Kubernetes native resource objects belonging 
to that NF Deployment from the target Kubernetes cluster. 
• Heal NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster: This O2dms capability enables the SMO to recover an NF 
Deployment from failures on a Kubernetes cluster. The SMO may trigger the NF Deployment recovery by 
creating, modifying, and/or deleting K8s native resource objects belonging to that NF Deployment. 
• Software Upgrade of NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster: This O2dms capability enables the SMO to 
upgrade the software version of an NF Deployment running on a Kubernetes cluster.  
• Scale NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster: This O2dms capability enables the SMO to elastically scale the 
NF Deployment’s service capacity to the service demands. Additional K ubernetes resources may be allocated 
to or deallocated from an NF Deployment as part of this use case.

3 O2dms Service Definitions 
3.1 General 
This section provides details of the O2dms interface capabilities for NF Deployment lifecycle management exposed to 
the SMO using the O2dms Kubernetes profile. The O2dms Kubernetes profile exposes a REST based interface to the 
SMO from the API Server function of Kubernetes native control plane. The protocol stack used by O2dms Kubernetes  
profile for secure communication between the SMO and the target Kubernetes cluster is depicted in  Figure 3.1-1. This 
protocol stack enables a secure transfer of the Kubernetes native API resource manifests from the SMO to the target 
Kubernetes cluster. 
 
Figure 3.1-1: Illustration of the protocol stack used by O2dms Kubernetes profile 
3.1.1 The O2dms Services Supported 
In this specification, the Kubernetes native APIs provide all the required capabilities to the SMO for NF Deployment 
lifecycle management in a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes native APIs are exposed by the API Server function of 
the Kubernetes native control plane and is the common denominator for the SMO to manage containerized workloads 
on Kubernetes based O-Clouds.  
The Kubernetes API Sever exposes a REST based interface, offering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
using Kubernetes native resource manifests. Aligned with this REST interface, the ORAN WG6 use cases captured in  
[2] for lifecycle management of NF Deployments are realized by using the API Server’s supported operations (CRUD) 
and data model (Kubernetes native resource manifests). 
3.1.2 Instantiate NF Deployment 
The instantiate NF Deployment use case enables the SMO to start the execution of a NF Deployment on a Kubernetes 
cluster that meets the NF Deployment’s execution requirements. In the O2dms Kubernetes profile, the instantiate NF 
Deployment use case is realized by secured transfer of the Kubernetes native resource manifests of the Kubernetes 
native resource objects from the SMO to the API Server function in the target Kubernetes cluster. An NF Deployment is 
usually composed of different Kubernetes native resource objects (e.g., Deployments, ConfigMaps, etc.) and a secured 
transfer of all Kubernetes manifests is required for successful completion of the instantiate NF Deployment use case.  
Figure 3.1.2-1 exemplifies the instantiate NF Deployment use case flow as per O2dms Kubernetes profile aligned with 
the NF Deployment instantiation use case in [2].

 Table 3.1.2-1: Instantiate NF Deployment Use Case 
Use Case Stage Evolution/Specification 
Use Case  Instantiate NF Deployment on a selected Kubernetes cluster 
Goal The goal of this use case is to instantiate an NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster that has 
been selected by the SMO to host that NF Deployment 
Actors and roles - NFO: The NFO initiates the NF Deployment instantiation process  
- Kubernetes API Server: O2dms termination point in Kubernetes cluster 
Preconditions - NFO is active and running normally 
- Kubernetes API server is accessible via O2dms interface 
Begins when The SMO decides to instantiate an NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster 
Step 1 (M) A request to instantiate a new NF Deployment is received by the NFO from an authorised 
NFO service consumer (e.g., rApp) with an identifier for the NF Deployment. (NOTE 1, 
NOTE 2) 
Step 2 (M) The NFO sends the Kubernetes native resource manifests to the API Server function in the 
chosen Kubernetes cluster using O2dms interface by making an HTTP POST call (s) to the 
respective resource URL with the Kubernetes resource manifest as payload. 
Step 3 (M) The API Server function authenticates the request and validates the resource manifest s and 
creates the respective resource objects in the Kubernetes cluster. (NOTE 3, NOTE 4) 
Step 4 (M) The API Server responds to the NFO by acknowledging the creation of the requested 
resource objects in the Kubernetes cluster. (NOTE 5) 
Ends when This use case ends when the NF Deployment is up and running in the chosen Kubernetes 
cluster. 
NOTE 1: The NF Deployment identifier provided is used by the NFO to get related artifacts for that NF 
Deployment (e.g., ASD, Helm Charts). 
NOTE 2: The NFO generates parameterized Kubernetes native resource manifests from the NF Deployment 
artifacts (e.g., ASD, Helm Charts). 
NOTE 3: The creation of a Kubernetes resource object results in an internal notification to the worker nodes that 
the NF Deployment resources need to be instantiated. 
NOTE 4: A worker node responsible for the workload execution fetches the container images from the image 
registery specified in the Kubernetes resource manifests files and starts its execution on that node. 
NOTE 5: There may be a delay between the Success response from the API Server to the NFO and the actual 
execution of the containerized workload on the Kubernetes cluster due to several reasons including, for example, 
the time it takes to pull the container images from the registry, the allocation of the resources to the container and 
the initialization of the application inside the containers. The NFO may check the status of the NF Deployment 
instantiation via O2dms to validate successful instantiation of the NF Deployment . 
 
3.1.3 Terminate NF Deployment  
The terminate NF Deployment use case requires the SMO to stop the execution of a NF Deployment on a Kubernetes 
cluster and release all resources that are used by that NF Deployment. In the O2dms Kubernetes profile, the terminate 
NF Deploymnt use case is realized by deleting all Kubernetes native resource objects belonging to the NF Deployment 
from the Kubernetes cluster that is running the NF Deployment. Figure 3.1.3-1 exemplifies the terminate NF 
Deployment use case flow in O2dms Kubernetes profile aligned with the NF Deployment termination use case in [2].

Use Case Stage Evolution/Specification 
Use Case Terminate NF Deployment on a selected Kubernetes cluster 
Goal The goal of this use case is to terminate an NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster that is 
hosting it and release all resources used by that NF Deployment 
Actors and roles - NFO: The NFO executes the NF Deployment termination process  
- Kubernetes API Server: O2dms termination point in Kubernetes cluster 
Preconditions - NFO is active and running normally 
- Kubernetes cluster is running normally  
- Kubernetes API server is accessible via O2dms interface 
Begins when The SMO decides to terminate an NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster 
Step 1 (M) A request to terminate an NF Deployment is received by the NFO with an identifier for that 
workload. (NOTE 1, NOTE 2) 
Step 2 (M) The NFO requests the deletion of all Kubernetes resource objects belonging to the NF 
Deployment from the API Server function in the target Kubernetes cluster by sending HTTP 
DELETE request(s) to the respective resource URL.  
Step 3 (M) The API Server function authenticates the request and deletes the requested resource objects 
from the Kubernetes cluster. (NOTE 3, NOTE 4) 
Step 4 (M) The API Server responds to the NFO by informing it about the resource objects that have been 
deleted from Kubernetes cluster. (NOTE 5) 
Ends when This use case ends when an NF Deployment running in a Kubernetes cluster is terminated, and 
all resources used by that NF Deployment are released. 
NOTE 1: The SMO may use the provided NF Deployment instance identifier for determining the Kubernetes cluster 
running that NF Deployment instance. 
NOTE 2: The NFO determines all the Kubernetes resources objects that collectively represent the NF Deployment in 
the target Kubernetes cluster. 
NOTE 3: The deletion of a Kubernetes resource object results in an internal notification to the worker nodes to 
release any resources used by the terminated NF Deployment. 
NOTE 4: The Kubernetes worker nodes automatically stop the execution of any workloads for which the Kubernetes 
native resource objects have been deleted from the Kubernetes cluster. 
NOTE 5: There may be a delay between the Success response from the API Server to the SMO and the actual 
termination of NF Deployment and release of resources in the Kubernetes cluster. The NFO may check the status of 
the NF Deployment termination via O2dms to validate successful termination of the NF Deployment.  
 
3.1.4 Heal NF Deployment 
Recovery of an NF Deployment from failures is documented in [2] clause 3.6.2, which describes an NF Deployment 
level healing use case based on either auto-healing support in the O-Cloud platform or SMO triggered healing over 
O2dms interface. Based on these healing triggers, the use case describes corrective actions that can be taken for NF 
Deployment healing in the O-Cloud such as restarting, replacing and/or reallocating O-Cloud resources belonging to the 
NF Deployment. This section describes the NF Deployment level healing use case for healing NF Deployments on a 
K8s cluster using O2dms K8s profile. 
3.1.4.1 Auto Healing of NF Deployment in a Kubernetes cluster 
Auto-healing of NF Deployment refers to the intrinsic capabilities of the O-Cloud platform to monitor the workloads 
and initiate corrective actions automatically when runtime errors/faults are detected by the O -Cloud platform. The 
Kubernetes platform provides auto-healing features based on continuous monitoring of the running containerized 
workloads (e.g., Pods) using liveness checks at the application layer. A workload designed for Kubernetes is expected 
to pass these liveness checks to be considered as healthy workload running in the K8s cluster. If the liveness checks fail 
for a workload, the Kubernetes control plane automatically replaces the failing workload with a new copy.  
When the restart and replacement mechanics of Kubernetes auto-healing process are not sufficient for the full recovery 
of the NF Deployment, the SMO may trigger NF Deployment healing using O2dms interface.

3.1.4.2 SMO triggered Healing of NF Deployment in a Kubernetes cluster 
Based on monitoring of the NF Deployment using O2 interface, the SMO may detect the need and decide to heal an NF 
Deployment using O2dms interface. This SMO triggered healing over O2dms may occur independently from any auto -
healing features running in the O-Cloud platform for healing NF Deployment. In the O2dms K8s profile, the SMO 
triggered NF Deployment healing is realized by creating, modifying and/or deleting K8s native resource objects 
belonging to the NF Deployment experiencing failures. Figure 3.1.4-1 exemplifies the SMO triggered healing of NF 
Deployment using the O2dms K8s profile.

 Table 3.1.4-1 Heal NF Deployment Use Case 
Use Case Stage Evolution/Specification 
Use Case Healing of an NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster 
Goal The goal of this use case is to heal an NF Deployment by the SMO using O2dms K8s 
profile  
Actors and roles - NFO: The NFO executes the NF Deployment healing process  
- Kubernetes API Server: O2dms termination point in Kubernetes cluster 
Preconditions The NF Deployment has been previously instantiated by the SMO 
Begins when The SMO decides to heal an NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster 
Step 1 The NFO receives a request to initiate NF Deploymet healing e.g., from an rApp. 
(NOTE) 
Step 2, 3, 4 If the NFO decides to heal the NF Deployment by creating additional K8s resource 
objects, it shall send the new K8s resource manifests using HTTP POST request(s) to the 
K8s API server (2). The K8s API server will create the new resource objects (3) and 
informs the NFO about the resource object creation (4).   
Step 5, 6, 7 If the NFO decides to heal the NF Deployment by modifying its K8s resource objects, it 
shall send updated K8s resource manifests using HTTP PUT/PATCH request(s) to the 
K8s API server (5). The K8s API server will update the NF Deployment resource objects 
(6) and informs the NFO about the resource object updates (7).   
Step 8, 9, 10 If the NFO decides to heal the NF Deployment by deleting some of the K8s resource 
objects belong to the NF Deployment, it shall delete those K8s resource objects using 
HTTP DELETE request(s) to the K8s API server (8). The K8s API server will delete the 
requested resource objects (9) and informs the NFO about the resource object deletion 
(10).   
Ends when This use case ends when the NF Deployment running in a Kubernetes cluster is 
recovered from failures. 
NOTE: The NFO determines the K8s resource objects belonging to the NF Deployment requiring updates 
(CRUD operations) for healing the NF Deployment. 
 
3.1.5 Software Upgrade of NF Deployment 
This section describes the use case for SMO managed software upgrade of an NF Deployment and its realization based 
on O2dms K8s API profile. 
3.1.5.1 Build-and-Replace Software Upgrade 
This section illustrates a build-and-replace NF Deployment upgrade approach in which an NF Deployment using old 
software version is replaced by a new and independently deployed instance using newer software version. This 
approach utilizes a graceful or soft upgrade where the old NF Deployment is not removed from a K8s cluster until this 
can be done without disrupting existing traffic that the NF Deployment supports.  
Upon receiving a request to upgrade software of a particular NF Deployment, the SMO instantiates a new NF 
Deployment according to the procedure described in section 3.1.2 (Instantiate NF Deployment). The new instance is 
created independently and uses newer software version of the NF Deployment. If a n exception occurs during the 
instantiation step that causes the new NF Deployment not to be created successfully, the operation is rolled back and 
further actions aborted i.e., the new NF Deployment instance is removed, and the old NF Deployment continues to 
provide service as before. 
After the new NF Deployment instantiation is successful, the SMO may trigger further actions e.g., O1 configuration of 
parts of the NF related to the NF Deployment. Once the new NF Deployment is up and running, the old NF Deployment 
is terminated according to the procedure described in section 3.1.3 (Terminate NF Deployment).

O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-K8S-PROFILE-R004-v06.00 
 
3.1.6 Scale NF Deployment 
3.1.6.1 Overview 
The Scale NF Deployment use case concerns allocation of additional or deallocation of existing K8s resources to/from 
an NF Deployment. This enables the SMO to increase or decrease the NF Deployment’s service capacity to the required 
service level. The allocation or deallocation of resources for scaling and subsequent change in NF Deployment service 
level happens within the bounds of resources available in the K8s cluster running that NF Deployment. In the O2dms 
K8s profile, Scale NF Deployment may be realized either by SMO managed scaling or by automatic scaling in the K8s 
cluster. These approaches enable different types of scaling such as scale -out, scale-in, scale-up, and scale-down of NF 
Deployment.  
3.1.6.2 SMO managed scale 
The SMO may initiate scaling of NF Deployment by creating new or updating the existing K8s resources belonging to 
that NF Deployment in the K8s cluster. The SMO may explicitly set parameters for K8s workload resources of the NF 
Deployment (e.g., Deployments, StatefulSets) or manage K8s HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) resource (see clause 
4.3.1.4) for auto-scaling. These approaches to scaling may manifest in the following ways: 
• SMO setting min/max replica count values for the HPA resource belonging to an NF Deployment. See clause 
3.1.6.3 for HPA resource.  
• SMO setting explicit replica counts values for K8s workload resource e.g., Deployments, Statefulsets.  
• SMO creating new or updating existing NF Deployment resources for which K8s auto -scaling does not apply 
e.g., storage, networking etc. 
Scale NF Deployment in a K8s cluster may result in allocation/deallocation of K8s resources related to compute, 
storage, networking, acceleration, etc. As part of the SMO managed scaling, K8s resources belonging to one or multiple 
DeploymentItems in the NF Deployment ASD package may be updated (e.g., executing a “helm upgrade” with updated 
lifecycle parameter values for one or multiple helm charts in the ASD package).  
Figure 3.1.6.2-1 exemplifies the SMO managed scaling of NF Deployment using the O2dms K8s profile.

 Table 3.1.6.2-1 Scale NF Deployment Use Case 
Use Case Stage Evolution/Specification 
Use Case Scale NF Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster to desired service level. 
Goal The goal of this use case is to scale an NF Deployment to a desired service level by the 
SMO using O2dms K8s profile.  
Actors and roles - SMO: The SMO initiates the scaling of NF Deployment.  
- Kubernetes API Server: O2dms termination point in Kubernetes cluster. 
Preconditions The NF Deployment has been previously instantiated by the SMO. 
Begins when The SMO decides to scale an NF Deployment on a K8s cluster. 
Step 1 The SMO receives a trigger to scale an NF Deployment to a new service level. 
(Alt choice) The SMO decides to scale the NF Deployment by creating additional K8s resources. The 
additional resources may belong to one or multiple of the DeploymentItems specified in the ASD package of 
the NF Deployment. 
Step 2 (M) The SMO sends new K8s native resource objects using HTTP POST request(s) to the 
K8s API server. 
Step 3 (M) The K8s API server creates the new K8s resources for the NF Deployment.  
Step 4 (M) The K8s API server informs the SMO about resource creation. 
(Alt choice) The SMO decides to scale an NF Deployment by updating/modifying its existing resources in 
the K8s cluster. 
Step 5 (M) The SMO sends updated K8s resource objects using HTTP PUT/PATCH request(s) to 
the K8s API server. 
Step 6 (M) The K8s API server updates the NF Deployment resources for scaling the workload.  
Step 7 (M) The K8s API server informs the SMO about the resource updates.   
Ends when This use case ends when the NF Deployment running in a Kubernetes cluster is scaled to 
the desired service level. 
 
3.1.6.3 Kubernetes sutoscaling 
K8s inherently supports automatic scaling of workloads based on autoscaling triggers specified for K8s workload 
resources such as K8s Deployments and StatefulSets. The K8s HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource (see clause 4.3.1.4) 
may be used to specify minimum and maximum replica count for K8s Pods belonging to an NF Deployment. The 
HorizontalPodAutoscaler resources may be created as part of NF Deployment instantiation process or as part of a later 
update.  
To scale an NF Deployment and increase/decrease its service capacity, the K8s cluster running the NF Deployment will 
automatically create new K8s Pods or reduce the number of existing Pods in the K8s cluster. These changes in the 
number of Pods are governed by specified minimum and maximum replica count numbers in the HPA resource and 
resource availability in the K8s cluster. Autoscaling of the NF Deployment resources is performed by K8s within the 
bounds of the HPA resources. The criteria based on which Kubernetes decides when to invoke automatic scaling or how 
the autoscaling is achieved are outside the scope of the present document.

4 O2dms Service Definitions for Kubernetes 
4.1 General  
The O2dms profile for Kubernetes is based on the usage of Kubernetes native APIs and data model as O2dms interface. 
Kubernetes offers a native REST based, secured interface with a large set of cluster -scoped and namespace-scoped 
resource objects as data model. This chapter provides the details of these K8s native APIs and data model. 
4.2 Referenced Cloud-Native APIs and Data Model Solutions 
4.2.1 Kubernetes API overview 
At high-level, the Kubernetes API [4] structure has a grouping of the managed K8s resource objects which represent 
K8s resource categories. The generic concepts are introduced regarding the data model of the managed K8s resource 
objects in Kubernetes. 
4.2.1.1 API Structure 
The Kubernetes API [4] managed objects represent a concrete instance of a K8s resource type on the Kubernetes 
cluster. Kubernetes leverages standard RESTful terminology to describe the API concepts:  
• A K8s resource is a single instance of a K8s resource type (Note: Throughout this document, to distinguish a 
"resource" in context of Kubernetes from the "resources" used in a different O -RAN context, this will now be 
called a "K8s resource") 
• A K8s resource type is the name used in the URL 
• All K8s resource types have a representation in JSON (their object schema) which is called a kind  
• A list of instances of a K8s resource type is known as a collection 
All K8s resource types are either scoped by the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., /apis/GROUP/VERSION/*) or to a namespace 
(e.g., /apis/GROUP/VERSION/namespaces/NAMESPACE/*). 
4.2.1.1.1 API Verbs 
API verbs GET, CREATE, UPDATE, PATCH, DELETE and PROXY support single K8s resources only. These verbs 
with single K8s resource support have no support for submitting multiple K8s resources together in an ordered or 
unordered list or transaction. API verbs LIST and WATCH support getting multiple K8s resources, and 
DELETECOLLECTION supports deleting multiple K8s resources. 
4.2.1.1.2 K8s resource Objects 
The Kubernetes API [4] supports read and write operations on the K8s resource objects via a Kubernetes API endpoint. 
Kubernetes differentiates the following categories of K8s resource objects managed via their APIs: 
• Workloads: objects used to manage and run OS containers on the Kubernetes cluster. 
• Discovery & Loadbalancing: objects used to inter-connect the workloads into externally accessible, load-
balanced services. 
• Configuration & Storage: objects used to inject initialization data into the containerized applications, and to 
persist data that is external to the OS containers. 
• Cluster: objects define how the Kubernetes cluster itself is configured. 
• Metadata: objects used to configure the behavior of other K8s resources within the Kubernetes cluster.

O-RAN.WG6.O2DMS-INTERFACE-K8S-PROFILE-R004-v06.00 
 Note: There are some Kubernetes resource objects (e.g., ClusterRoles, CustomResourceDefinitions, StorageClasses 
etc.) which the SMO may manage separately from the containerized workload resource management. These are FFS. 
4.2.1.2 Data model concepts 
The K8s resource objects are modelled with individual object schemas. All K8s resource objects typically have 3 
components: 
• K8s resource ObjectMeta: The metadata about the K8s resource object, such as its name, type, api version, 
annotations, and labels. This schema, which is common to all K8s resource types, contains fields that maybe 
updated both by the SMO and the Kuberneters cluster’s internal control plane. 
• K8s resourceSpec: It is defined by the SMO and describes the desired state of system concerning the K8s 
resource object. Specified when creating or modifying a K8s resource object is requested. 
• K8s resourceStatus: Provided by the Kubernetes cluster’s internal control plane and represents the current 
state of the system concerning the K8s resource object. 
4.2.1.3 O2dms Procedures 
The following are the list of Kubernetes procedures supported by the O2 dms: 
• CREATE: The CREATE procedure enables the SMO to instantiate a workload on the target Kubernetes 
cluster. This procedure requires a namespace and a specified K8s resource type. 
• READ: 
o GET: The GET procedure enables the SMO to retrieve and read a specified workload from a target 
Kubernetes cluster. This procedure requires a namespace, a specified K8s resource type, and the name 
of the K8s resource. 
o LIST: The LIST procedure enables the SMO to list or watch a specified workload type from a target 
Kubernetes cluster. This procedure requires a namespace and a specified K8s resource type. 
• UPDATE: 
o PATCH: The PATCH procedure enables the SMO to partially update a workload in a Kubernetes 
cluster. This procedure requires a namespace, a specified K8s resource type, and the name of the K8s 
resource. 
o REPLACE: The REPLACE procedure enables the SMO to replace a workload in a target Kubernetes 
cluster. This procedure requires a namespace, a specified K8s resource type, the name of the K8s 
resource. 
• DELETE: The DELETE procedure enables the SMO to terminate a workload (s) in a target Kubernetes 
cluster. This procedure requires a namespace, a specified K8s resource type, and the name of the K8s resource. 
4.3 Referenced K8s resource objects 
The Kubernetes APIs and resource objects are fully specified by the open -source Kubernetes project and this document 
adopts those definitions, APIs, and resource objects [5]. For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions for 
Kubernetes API resource objects given in [5] would apply. This section provides details of relevant K8s APIs and 
resource objects along with recommended use and constraints, if any.

4.3.1 Kubernetes Native Namespace Scoped Resource Objects 
4.3.1.1 Kubernetes native workload resources 
4.3.1.1.1 Pod 
A Pod is the smallest and most basic deployable unit of functionality in a K8s cluster. A Pod resource represents a 
single instance of one or multiple containers that are scheduled and run on a single worker node in a K8s cluster. The 
containers in a Pod are managed as a single unit and share the Pod’s networking and storage resources.  
Table 4.3.1.1.1-1 provides details of the standard K8s Pod resource specification.  
Table 4.3.1.1.1-1: Pod resource specification [5]  
Resource Field Resource Field Type  Resource Field Description 
apiVerison string Defines the versioned schema of the Pod resource.  
kind string Represents the REST resource for Pod resource. The K8s API Server 
may infer this from the endpoint the client submits the request to. The 
value cannot be updated. 
metadata ObjectMeta Standard metadata of the Pod resource [6]. 
spec PodSpec Specifies the desired behavior of the Pod resource. 
status PodStatus Represents the most recent observed status of the Pod resource. 
 
Table 4.3.1.1.1-2 provides relevant K8s Pod resource URIs and supported HTTP methods using O2dms interface. For 
the SMO to lifecycle manage a K8s Pod resource in a chosen K8s cluster using O2dms K8s profile, it shall use the 
URIs, and HTTP methods listed in Table 4.3.1.1.1-2 with K8s standard query and body parameters for Pod resource 
included in the HTTP request [5]. 
Table 4.3.1.1.1-2: Pod resource URIs and HTTP methods supported using O2dms K8s profile 
Relevant Pod Resource URIs Supported HTTP Methods  
/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods • POST: Create a Pod resource in the specified 
namespace

• DELETE: Delete all Pods resources from the 
namespace 
/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name} • PUT: Replace the Pod resource in the namespace 
• PATCH: Partial update the Pod resource in the 
namespace 
• DELETE: Delete the Pod resource from the namespace 
• GET: Get status of the Pod resource in the namespace 
/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/eviction • POST: Terminate the running Pod instance 
 
NOTE: A Pod resource should not be created directly via O2dms because a Pod resource created directly is not 
managed by K8s control plane and it cannot repair or replace itself. A Pod resources should be created 
through K8s controller resources instead (e.g., Deployment, Job, Statefulset).  
4.3.1.1.2 Deployment 
A K8s deployment resource is used for running one or multiple identical stateless Pods in a K8s cluster. A Deployment 
resource ensures that the desired number of replicas of a Pod are running at any given time by replacing any failed or 
unresponsive Pod instances. The Deployment resource object contains the Pod resource template which specifies the 
details of the Pods to be created and instantiated on K8s worker node/s. Deployment resource is generally used for 
running stateless applications in K8s clusters since it does not provide a unique identity to the Pods it manages.  
Table 4.3.1.1.2-1 provides details of the standard K8s Deployment resource specification.  
Table 4.3.1.1.2-1: Deployment resource specification [5]

• GET: Read the Deployment resource in the namespace 
 
NOTE: The creation of a Deployment resource in a K8s cluster also results in the creation of the K8s ReplicaSet 
resource in the same cluster. The ReplicaSet resource ensures that the number of Pods running in the 
cluster are equal to the number requested in the Deployment resource. A Deploy ment resource should be 
used instead of creating the ReplicaSet resource directly. The K8s Deployment resource fully substitutes 
the ReplicaSet functions and should be used in most cases. 
4.3.1.1.3 StatefulSet 
A K8s statefulset resource is used for running one or multiple stateful Pods that maintain unique and persistent 
identities and hostnames during their lifetime. The Pods belonging to a StatefulSet resource are created from the same 
Pod spec but maintain their individual identities across any rescheduling events caused by Pod failures. In addition, 
statefulsets provide an ordered and graceful deployment and scaling of Pods in K8s clusters. By default, the Pod 
deployment for statefulsets is done in sequential order and termination in reverse order but this behavior can be 
overridden.  For state persistency, StatefulSet resources are generally paired with persistent storage volumes and this 
paired relationship is maintained across Pod rescheduling events.

and external clients. The Service resource also abstracts the ephemeral nature of Pods and containers by creating a 
constant point of entry to the group of Pods that provide the same functionality. Each Service gets an IP address and 
port number that does not change during the lifetime of the Service resource in the K8s cluster. In addition, the Service 
resource provides load-balancing across all Pod instances that provide the same functionality. Kubern etes supports five 
types of Service resources identified as ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName and Headless Service with 
ClusterIP being the default Service type.

 4.3.1.2.2 Ingress 
A K8s Ingress resource is used for defining HTTP(s) routing rules that control external access to applications running 
inside the K8s cluster. A K8s Ingress resource can be associated with one or more K8s Service resources (each of which 
can expose a different set of Pods) and offers load-balancing and SSL termination features. The Ingress resource can 
assign a specific externally reachable URL to each Service resource associated with it.

NOTE:  For an Ingress resource to work, an Ingress controller (i.e., an additional controller to the default K8s 
controllers) shall be running inside the K8s cluster. K8s does not offer a default ingress controller and 
leaves the choice of ingress controller to the cluster administrator. In the ORAN context, the K8s cluster 
may have a default ingress controller installed at the time of cluster creation, or the SMO may decide to 
extend the K8s cluster with any specific ingress controller after cluster creation usin g O2dms interface.  
4.3.1.2.3 NetworkPolicy 
A K8s NetworkPolicy resource is used to control traffic flow to/from a K8s workloads at the IP address or port level 
using ingress and egress rules. These rules may apply to other K8s Pods, Namespaces, or generic IP blocks to restrict or 
allow traffic from these entities. Selectors and IP blocks (CIDR ranges) are used to enforce the NetworkPolicy 
constraints specified in the NetworkPolicy resource specification.  
Table 4.3.1.2.3-1 provides details of the standard K8s NetworkPolicy resource specification.

NOTE:  The functionality of the NetworkPolicy resource depends on the presence of a compatible K8s network 
plugin that supports K8s network policies. Without a supporting network plugin, the NetworkPolicy 
resource creation will have no impact on the ingress and egress traffic to/from a K8s workload.  
4.3.1.3 Kubernetes native storage and workload configuration resources 
4.3.1.3.1 ConfigMap 
A K8s ConfigMap resource is used for storing non-confidential data in the form of key-value pairs that can be read as 
runtime configurations by Pods in a K8s cluster. ConfigMap resource can be used to store configuration files, 
environment variables or command line arguments for workloads to use at runtime. A ConfigMap resource decouples 
the workload containers from environment specific configuration data thereby making the K8s Pods easily portable 
across the worker nodes in a K8s cluster. The data stored in a ConfigMap cannot exceed 1 MiB.

4.3.1.4.1 LimitRange 
A K8s LimitRange resource is used to set constraints on the resource utilization of Pods and containers in a namespace. 
By default, a container can use as much compute resources as it needs in the namespace and that can lead to resource 
contention problems among Pods and containers that share the namespace and may belong to different priority classes. 
A LimitRange resource an enforce defaults or min-max values for different resources in the namespace (e.g., CPU, 
memory, storage) at Pod or container level.

4.3.1.4.3 HorizontalPodAutoscaler 
A K8s HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource is used to automatically scale up or down, the number of Pod instances 
belonging to a workload resource that supports horizontal scaling (e.g., Deployments and StatefulSets). The scale-up 
and scale-down levels are controlled by defined minimum and maximum values in the HorizontalPodAutoscaler 
resource. The HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource works by changing the “scale” property of a workload resource e.g., 
Deployment, based on observed metrics such as CPU and Memory utilization.  
NOTE: For the K8s cluster to horizontally scale a workload based on the metrics specified in the K8s 
HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource, it should have a metrics collection service running in the cluster.
