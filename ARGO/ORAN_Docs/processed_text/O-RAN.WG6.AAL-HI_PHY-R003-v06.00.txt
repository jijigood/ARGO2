6.3.5	SRS Channel Model
Per section 5.1.3.3.7 of the O-RAN AAL GAnP document [7] for the SRS High-PHY Profile, the SRS Channel model of the AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY Profile supports acceleration of SRS.
The set of accelerated functions associated with the processing of SRS is as follows:

From the AAL Application, the SRS interface receives the associated parameters for the configuration of the SRS Resource.
The output data consists of the channel estimation metrics
6.3.5.2	SRS Parameters
The following parameters are required to be supported by the AALI implementation when offloading operations. The AAL Application shall supply all relevant parameters; for ease of reading, the parameters are grouped as follows, in alignment with the O-RAN AAL GAnP document [7]:

6.3.7	Beamforming
In this release, the AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY profile supports the following beamforming methods available for OFH signaling:
Predefined-Beam Beamforming, as defined in section 10.4.2.1 of [8];
Weight-based Dynamic Beamforming, as defined in section 10.4.2.2 of [8];
Attribute-Based Dynamic Beamforming, as defined in section 10.4.3 of [8];
Channel-Information-Based Beamforming, as defined in section 10.4.4 of [8].
6.3.7.1	Predefined-Beam Beamforming
The AALI shall support the AAL Application signaling as described in section 6.2.7.1
6.3.7.2	Weight-based Dynamic Beamforming
The AALI shall support the AAL Application signaling of the following parameters, as needed for AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY profile signaling of beamforming weight vectors of (bfwI, bfwQ) in C-Plane Extensions 1, 11, 19 [8]:
Table 6.3.7.2-1: Weight-based Dynamic Beamforming Parameters for Uplink
The High-PHY AAL API shall be extensible to allow, in future releases, the optional ability for the beamforming weights to be generated outside the AAL-LPU that consumes them for generating the appropriate C- and U-plane signaling by the accelerator, e.g. to generate the corresponding U-Plane eAxC I/Q sample streams and C-plane ueId field(s).
6.3.7.3 Attribute-Based Dynamic Beamforming
The AALI shall support the AAL Application signaling as described in section 6.2.7.3
6.3.7.4	Channel-Information-Based Beamforming
The AALI shall support the AAL Application signaling of the following parameters, as needed for AAL-LPU-signaling of channel estimate vectors of (ciIsample, ciQsample) in C-Plane Section 6 [8]:

Annex A [informative] Stage-3 Support for AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY and AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY using FAPI
This annex illustrates how SCF-222 [i.1] and SCF-223 [i.2] can be used to provide stage-3 support for the AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY and AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY profiles in this document.
In particular:
Profile capabilities (sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.2) and Configurations (sections 6.2.2b and 6.3.2b) are supported via the SCF P5 interface
Profile slot-level APIs (DL sections 6.2.3 – 6.2.7, UL sections 6.3.3 – 6.3.7) are supported via the SCF P7 interface
Channel Models referenced in this document correspond to PDUs, which are transported over SCF P7 APIs in SCF-222
NOTE:
this illustration does not preclude other stage-3 implementations of the the stage-2 APIs referenced this document, nor does it preclude the addition of other features or extensions in the future.
alignment of this document with non-O-RAN Alliance specifications is not required.
An illustration of this stage-3 support is further illustrated below for mapping of the CSI-RS Channel Model parameters from section 6.2.5 to CSI-RS PDU and related parameters in SCF-222 [i.1] and SCF-223 [i.2]:
