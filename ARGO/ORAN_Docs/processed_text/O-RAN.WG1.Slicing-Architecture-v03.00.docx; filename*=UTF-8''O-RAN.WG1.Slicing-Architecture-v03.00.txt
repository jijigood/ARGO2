 Slicing Overview

Network Slicing is expected to play a critical role in 5G networks because of various use cases and services 5G will support. It allows a network operator to provide services tailored to customers’ requirements. Network slice is defined as a logical network with a bundle of specified network services over a common network infrastructure.  A single physical network is sliced into multiple virtual networks that can support different service types over a single RAN. 3GPP has standardized 4 different service types: eMBB, URLLC, MIoT and V2X [3].

3GPP defined 5G architecture and procedures containing network slicing and related concepts in Release 15. Furthermore, management and orchestration of 5G networks featuring slicing was defined in the 3GPP specifications. Other standard groups e.g. GSMA, ETSI NFV-MANO, ETSI ZSM and ONAP focus on the different aspects of network slicing. Further information regarding network slicing and other SDO’s contributions was discussed in the Study on O-RAN Slicing Technical Report [14].

A sample RAN slicing deployment of O-RAN network functions based on the select initial deployment option, option B as described in [13], is shown in Figure 2-1, with some of the network functions shared between RAN slice subnets (such as O-CU-CP, O-DU, O-RU) and some network functions dedicated to a particular RAN slice subnet (such as O-CU-UP).

Figure 2-1: Example O-RAN Slicing Deployment

 High-Level O-RAN Slicing Use Cases

This section contains high-level O-RAN slicing use cases that O-RAN is expected to support. Slicing requirements will include the requirements derived from the specified use cases.  Additional use cases will be added as prioritized by the O-RAN community in future versions of this document. It should be noted that not all of the use cases presented here are currently supported by O-RAN specifications and these use cases will be addressed in future O-RAN work.

O-RAN Slice Subnet Management and Provisioning Use Cases

Network slicing is conceived to be an end-to-end feature that includes the core network, the transport network and the RAN. Although 3GPP has started defining network slicing support with Release 15, slicing in O-RAN needs to be further addressed in line with 3GPP to achieve deployable network slicing in an open RAN environment.

Management aspects of network slicing such as Network Slice Instances (NSI) and Network Slice Subnet Instances (NSSI) are defined by 3GPP. While NSI refers to an end-to-end network slice, NSSI refers to a part of it such as a RAN slice subnet. The provisioning of network slicing includes the four phases which are preparation, commissioning, operation and decommissioning. The NSI/NSSI provisioning operations include:

-	Create an NSI/NSSI;

-	Activate an NSI/NSSI;

-	De-active an NSI/NSSI;

-	Modify an NSI/NSSI;

-	Terminate an NSI/NSSI.

Further details of NSI and NSSI lifecycle management and provisioning can be found 3GPP TS28.531 [5], Section 4.1.

This chapter provides the use cases and procedures necessary for O-RAN Slice Subnet Management that is in-line with 3GPP Slice Management framework. For this purpose, use cases such as slice subnet creation, activation, modification, deactivation, termination, configuration and feasibility check are considered for O-RAN architecture.

Goal

Creation of a new O-RAN network slice subnet instance (O-NSSI) or use an existing O-NSSI to satisfy the RAN slice subnet related requirements (see clause 5.1.2 in TS 28.531 [5]).

Non-RT RIC

O-RAN Network Functions: NFs such as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU.

Assumptions

NSSMS_P is aware of O-Cloud M&O to manage the lifecycle of VNFs and interconnection between the VNFs and PNFs.

Pre conditions

VNF packages for virtualized O-RAN network functions to be included in the O-RAN slice subnet instance have been already on-boarded.

Begins when

NSSMS_P receives request for a network slice subnet instance. The request contains network slice subnet related requirements.

Step 1 (M)

NSSMS_P checks the feasibility of the request, based on the received network slice subnet related requirements.

O-RAN Slice Subnet Instance Modification Use Case

Step 4 (M)

NSSMS_P derives the requirements for the constituent NSSI(s).

Step 5 (O)

If the required O-NSSI contains constituent NSSI(s) managed by other NSSMS_P(s), NSSMS_P may trigger creation of respective constituent NSSI(s) through other NSSMS_P(s) which manages the constituent NSSI(s).

In that case, NSSMS_P receives the constituent NSSI information from the other NSSMS_P(s) and associates the constituent NSSI(s) with the required O-NSSI.

(O-RAN) Slice Subnet Instance Creation Use Case (to create constituent (O-)NSSI(s) managed by other NSSMS_P(s))

Step 6 (M)

NSSMS_P determines the service related requirements and triggers a service request to O-Cloud M&O for instantiation of virtual O-RAN network functions and virtual links within the determined O-Cloud(s).

Based on the service request, O-Cloud M&O performs corresponding NF instantiation procedures and virtual link establishment.

Use Case Stage

Evolution / Specification

<<Uses>>

Related use

Goal

Activation of an O-RAN network slice subnet instance (O-NSSI) (see clause 5.1.10 in TS 28.531 [5]).

Actors and Roles

NSSMS_C such as NSMF, who acts as an example network slice subnet management service consumer.

NSSMS_P such as NSSMF, who acts as an example of network slice subnet management service provider.

NFMS_P such as SMO OAM Functions or NFMF who acts as an example of network function management service provider.

O-RAN Network Functions: NFs such as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU.

Assumptions

NSSMS_P is providing services to authorized consumers.

Pre conditions

An O-NSSI has already been created and it is inactive.

As an example, the O-NSSI may contain inactive O-RAN NFs:- Near-RT RIC is installed and active

- O-CU-CP installed (i.e. operationalState = enabled), but not yet activated (i.e. administrativeState = locked).

- O-CU-UP installed (i.e. operationalState = enabled), but not yet activated (i.e. administrativeState = locked).

- O-DU installed (i.e. operationalState = enabled), but not yet activated (i.e. administrativeState = locked) (see figure B.2.2 in TS 28.541 [6]).

- O-RU physically installed (i.e. operationalState = enabled), but not yet activated (i.e. administrativeState = locked).

NOTE: The O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU are not shared by other O-NSSI, since they are not yet activated. Near-RT RIC has already been activated for other services.

Begins when

NSSMS_P decides to activate the  O-NSSI based on the received network slice subnet related request from its authorized consumer NSSMS_C.

Step 1 (M)

NSSMS_P receives a request from NSSMS_C to activate the O-NSSI (via NSSI Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.2-1 in TS 28.531 [14]) to change administrativeState of the O-NSSI to unlocked.)

Step 2 (M)

NSSMS_P identifies the inactive constituents within the O-NSSI and decides to activate those constituents which can be NFs or NSSI.

As an example, NSSMS_P activates the following inactive O-RAN NF constituents:

- the O-CU-CP NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to activate the O-CU-CP by changing the administrativeState of the O-CU-CP to unlocked.

NOTE: O-CU-CP starts to establish the E2 interface connection with Near-RT RIC.

- the O-CU-UP NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to activate the O-CU-UP by changing the administrativeState of the O-CU-UP to unlocked.

NOTE 1: O-CU-UP starts to establish the E2 interface connection with Near-RT RIC.

NOTE 2: E1 interface connection will be established between O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP.

- the O-DU NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to activate the O-DU by changing the administrativeState of the O-DU to unlocked.

NOTE 1: O-DU starts to establish the F1 interface connection with O-CU, (see Annex A.1 in TS 28.541 [6]).

NOTE 2: O-DU starts to establish the E2 interface connection with Near-RT RIC.

- the O-RU NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to activate the O-RU by changing the administrativeState of the O-RU to unlocked.

NOTE: O-RU starts to establish the M plane interface connection with O-DU [9].

Step 3 (M)

NSSMS_P receives notifications indicating that all inactive NSSI constituents are activated. (NSSMS_P is notified by respective NFMS_P(s) which invokes NF Provisioning data report service with notification notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) that the O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU have been activated.)

Step 4 (M)

NSSMS_P changes administrativeState of the O-NSSI to unlocked, and invokes NSSI Provisioning data report service with notification notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges (see table 6.2-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to notify NSSMS_C that the O-NSSI has been activated.

Ends when

O-RAN O-NSSI is activated.

Exceptions

One of the steps identified above fails.

Post Conditions

O-NSSI is in operation.

Begins when

NSSMS_P receives request for a modification of an existing O-NSSI. The request contains new network slice subnet related requirements.

Step 1 (M)

NSSMS_P checks the feasibility of the request, based on the received network slice subnet related modification requirements. If the modification requirements can be satisfied, go to step 2, else go to step 8.

O-RAN Slice Subnet Feasibility Check

Step 2 (M)

NSSMS_P decomposes the O-NSSI modification request into modification requests for each (O-)NSSI constituent.

Step 3 (O)

If the required O-NSSI contains constituent (O-)NSSI(s) managed by other NSSMS_P(s), NSSMS_P may trigger modification of respective constituent (O-)NSSI(s) through other NSSMS_P(s) which manages the constituent (O-)NSSI(s).

In that case, NSSMS_P receives the constituent (O-)NSSI information from the other NSSMS_P(s) and associates the constituent (O-)NSSI(s) with the required O-NSSI.

(O-RAN) Slice Subnet Instance Modification Use Case (to modify constituent (O-)NSSI(s) managed by other NSSMS_P(s))

Step 4 (O)

If the O-NSSI contains virtualized part(s), NSSMS_P triggers a service modification request to O-Cloud M&O for scaling, updating, instantiation etc. of virtual O-RAN network functions and virtual links within the determined O-Cloud(s).

Ends when

O-RAN O-NSSI and relevant O-RAN NFs are modified, and Non-RT RIC is configured with modified slice requirements and O-NSSI information.

Exceptions

One of the steps identified above fails.

Post Conditions

O-NSSI is ready to satisfy the updated network slice subnet related requirements.

NSSMS_P identifies active constituents (e.g. NSSI, NF) of the NSSI and decides to deactivate those constituents.

As an example, NSSMS_P finds that the O-NSSI contains active non-shared O-RAN NFs:

- the O-CU-CP NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to deactivate the O-CU-CP by changing the administrativeState of the O-CU-CP to locked.

NOTE 1: O-CU-CP starts to terminate the E2 interface connection with Near-RT RIC.

NOTE 2: E1 interface connection will be released between O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP.

- the O-CU-UP NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to deactivate the O-CU-UP by changing the administrativeState of the O-CU-UP to locked.

NOTE: O-CU-UP starts to terminate the E2 interface connection with Near-RT RIC.

- the O-DU NF constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to deactivate the O-DU by changing the administrativeState of the O-DU to locked.

NOTE 1: O-DU starts to terminate the F1 interface connection with O-CU, (see Annex A.1 in TS 28.541 [6]).

NOTE 2: O-DU starts to terminate the E2 interface connection with Near-RT RIC.

- the O-RU constituent, and invokes NF Provisioning service with operation modifyMOIAttributes (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to request NFMS_P to deactivate the O-RU by changing the administrativeState of the O-RU to locked.

NOTE: O-RU starts to terminate the M plane interface connection with O-DU [9].

Step 3 (M)

NSSMS_P receives notifications indicating that all active non-shared NSSI constituents are deactivated.

(NSSMS_P is notified by respective NFMS_P(s) which invoke NF Provisioning data report service with notification notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges (see table 6.3-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to notify that the O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU have been deactivated.)

Step 4 (M)

NSSMS_P changes administrativeState of the O-NSSI to locked, and invokes NSSI Provisioning data report service with notification notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges (see table 6.2-1 in TS 28.531 [5]) to notify NSSMS_C that the O-NSSI has been deactivated.

O-RAN Slicing Use Cases

3.2.1	Use Case 1: RAN Slice SLA Assurance

In the 5G era, network slicing is a prominent feature which provides end-to-end connectivity and data processing tailored to specific business requirements. These requirements include customizable network capabilities such as the support of very high data rates, traffic densities, service availability and very low latency. According to 5G standardization efforts, the 5G system should support the needs of the business through the specification of several service needs such as data rate, traffic capacity, user density, latency, reliability, and availability. These capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the mobile operator and the business customer, which brought up interest for mechanisms to ensure slice SLAs and prevent its possible violations. O-RAN’s open interfaces and AI/ML based architecture will enable such challenging mechanisms to be implemented and help pave the way for operators to realize the opportunities of network slicing in an efficient manner.

RAN slice SLA assurance scenario involves Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, E2 Nodes and SMO interaction.  The scenario starts with the retrieval of RAN specific slice SLA/requirements (possibly within SMO or from NSSMF depending on Operator deployment options). Based on slice specific performance measurements from E2 Nodes, Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC can fine-tune RAN behavior aligned with O-RAN architectural roles to assure RAN slice SLAs. Non-RT RIC monitors long-term trends and patterns for RAN slice subnets’ performance, and employs AI/ML methods to perform corrective actions through SMO (e.g. reconfiguration via O1) or via creation of A1 policies. Non-RT RIC can also construct/train relevant AI/ML models that will be deployed at Near-RT RIC. A1 policies possibly include scope identifiers (e.g. S-NSSAI) and statements such as KPI targets. On the other hand, Near-RT RIC enables optimized RAN actions through execution of deployed AI/ML models in near-real-time by considering both O1 configuration (e.g. static RRM policies) and received A1 policies, as well as received slice specific E2 measurements.

Figure 3.2.2-1: RAN Slice SLA Assurance use case overview

The more detailed functions provided by the entities for RAN slice SLA assurance are listed as below:

Non-RT RIC:

Retrieve RAN slice SLA target from respective entities such as SMO, NSSMF

Long term monitoring of RAN slice subnet performance measurements

Training of potential ML models that will be deployed in Near-RT RIC for optimized slice assurance

Support deployment and update of AI/ML models into Near-RT RIC

Send A1 policies and enrichment information to Near-RT RIC to drive slice assurance

Send O1 reconfiguration requests to SMO for slow-loop slice assurance

Near-RT RIC:

Near real-time monitoring of slice specific RAN performance measurements

Support deployment and execution of the AI/ML models from Non-RT RIC

Support interpretation and execution of policies from Non-RT RIC

Perform optimized RAN (E2) actions to achieve RAN slice subnet requirements based on O1 configuration, A1 policy, and E2 reports

RAN:

Support slice assurance actions such as slice-aware resource allocation, prioritization, etc.

Support slice specific performance measurements through O1

Support slice specific performance reports through E2

3.2.2	Use Case 2: Multi-vendor Slices

This use case enables multiple slices with functions provided by multi-vendors, such as slice #1, composed of DU(s) and CU(s), provided by vendor B and slice #2, composed of DU(s) and CU(s), provided by vendor C.

Figure 3.2.2-1: Multi-vendor Slices

When providing multiple slices, it is assumed that suitable vO-DU/scheduler and vO-CU treat each slice respectively. A vendor who provides vO-DU and vO-CU function may have a strength of a customized scheduler for a certain service. With accomplishment of multi-vendor circumstances, following benefits can be expected:

More flexible and time to market deployment

Operators can maximize options to choose suitable vO-DU/scheduler and vO-CU to offer various slices.  For example, some vendors may have a strength of a scheduler for eMBB service and the other may have a strength of scheduler for URLLC service. Or, vendor A can provide vO-DU/scheduler and vO-CU suitable for URLLC earlier than vendor B, therefore operators can choose vO-DU and vO-CU functions from vendor A to meet their service requirements.

Also, when an operator wants to add a new service/slice, new functions from a new vendor can be introduced with less consideration for existing vendors if multi-vendor circumstance was realized. This may help expand vendor’s business opportunities rapidly.

Flexible deployment when sharing RAN equipment among operators

When operators want to share RAN equipment and resources, RAN vendors and their placement of each RAN functions may be different. If multi-vendor circumstance was introduced, then it can relax restrictions among operators to share RAN equipment and resources. This may help expanded opportunities for reaching agreements of RAN sharing among operators. With expansion of RAN sharing, operators CAPEX and OPEX can be optimized, helping with additional investment opportunities.

Reducing supply chain risk

If an existing vendor providing a certain pair of vO-DU and vO-CU functions withdraws of the market due to business reasons, operators can deploy new vO-DU and vO-CU functions alternatively from other vendors under this multi-vendor circumstance. This can reduce a risk for operators’ business continuity.

To realise multi-vendor slices, some coordination between vO-DU/vO-CUs will be required since radio resource shall be assigned properly and without any conflicts. Depending on different service goals and the potential impact on O-RAN architecture, a required coordination scheme needs to be determined. The possible cases are:

Loose coordination through O1/E2/A1 interface (Case 1 in Figure 3.2.2-2)

Moderate coordination through X2/F1 interface (Case 2 in Figure 3.2.2-2)

Tight coordination through a new interface between vO-DUs (Case 3 in Figure 3.2.2-2)

Figure 3.2.2-2: Multi-vendor Slices Coordination Scheme Options

In case 1, a resource allocation between slices or vO-DU/vO-CUs is provisioned through O1/A1/E2 interface and each pair of vO-DU and vO-CU will allocate radio resources to each customer within radio resources allocated by Near-RT RIC and/or Non-RT RIC.

In case 2, a resource allocation can be negotiated between slices or vO-DU/vO-CUs through X2 and F1 after provisioned through O1/E2/A1 interface. Negotiation period will be several seconds due to periodicity of X2 and F1 message exchange between vO-CU(s).

If a more adaptive radio resource allocation is needed (case 3), a more frequent negotiation would be required. This can potentially be achieved via an interface or API extension between vO-DU(s), which would be for FFS in WG1 and WG4.

3.2.3	Use Case 3: NSSI Resource Allocation Optimization

5G networks are becoming increasingly complex with the densification of millimeter wave small cells, and various new services, such as eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications), and mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications) that are characterized by high speed high data volume, low speed ultra-low latency, and infrequent transmitting low data volume from huge number of emerging smart devices, respectively. It is a challenging task for 5G networks to allocate resources dynamically and efficiently among multiple network nodes to support various services. However, eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC services in 5G are typically realized as NSI(s) (Network Slice instance(s)). Therefore, the resources allocated to NSSI (Network Slice Subnet Instance) to support the O-RAN nodes can be optimized according to the service requirements.

As the new 5G services have different characteristics, the network traffic tends to be sporadic, where there may be different usage pattern in terms of time, location, UE distribution, and types of applications. For example, most IoT sensor applications may run during off-peak hours or weekends. Special events, such as sport games, concerts, can cause traffic demand to shoot up at certain times and locations. Therefore, NSSI resource allocation optimization function trains the AI/ML model, based on the huge volume of performance data collected over days, weeks, months from O-RAN nodes. It then uses the AI/ML model to predict the traffic demand patterns of 5G networks in different times and locations for each network slice subnet, and automatically re-allocates the network resources ahead of the network issues surfaced.

Figure 3.2.3-1 shows the NSSI resource allocation optimization on the Non-RT RIC, and may consist of the following steps:

Monitoring: monitor the radio network(s) by collecting data via the O1 interface, including the following performance measurements that are measured per NSSI (TS 28.552 [7]):

DL PRB used for data traffic

UL PRB used for data traffic

Average DL UE throughput in gNB

Average UL UE throughput in gNB

Number of PDU Sessions requested to setup

Number of PDU Sessions successfully setup

Number of PDU Sessions failed to setup

Analysis & Decision: analyse the data to train the AI/ML model, and then determine the actions needed to add or reduce the resources (e.g. capacity, VNF resources, slice subnet attributes (TS 28.541 [6]), etc.) for the NSSI at the given time, and location.

Execution: execute the following actions to reallocate the NSSI resources:

3a. Re-configure the NSSI attributes via the O1 interface

3b. Update the cloud resources via the O2 interface

Figure 3.2.3-1: The realization of NSSI resource allocation optimization over Non-Real Time RIC

The more detailed functions provided by the entities for NSSI resource optimization are listed as follows:

Non-RT RIC:

Collect the performance measurements related to NSSI resource usage from the O-RAN nodes via the O1 interface.

Train the AI/ML model based on the analysis of historical performance measurements, to predict of the traffic demand patterns of NSSI at different times and locations.

Determine the time/date and locations (i.e. which O-RAN nodes) to add or reduce the resources (e.g. capacity, VNF resources, slice subnet attributes (TS 28.541 [6]), etc.) for a given NSSI based on inference.

Perform the following action(s) to optimize the NSSI resource allocation, at the time determined by the model

Re-configure the NSSI attributes via the O1 interface

Update the cloud resources via the O2 interface

E2 Nodes (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU):

Support the performance measurement collection with required granularity over O1 interface.

Support the configuration related to the NSSI resource allocation update over O1 interface.

O-RAN reference slicing architecture includes slice management functions along with O-RAN architectural components. As O-RAN’s general principle is to be as compliant as possible with 3GPP architecture, these slice management functions are 3GPP defined NSMF and NSSMF with extensions for O-RAN network functions. Various deployment options of the location of NSMF and NSSMF have been presented in [14] and more detailed architectural implementation options for SMOs including NFV-MANO and ONAP are being presented in Appendix A.

Non-RT RIC

The fundamental role of the Non-RT RIC in O-RAN slicing architecture is to gather long term slice related data through interaction with the SMO framework and apply AI/ML based approaches interworking with the Near-RT RIC to provide innovative RAN slicing use cases. For this purpose, Non-RT RIC should be aware of RAN slice subnets and their respective SLAs through SMO. In addition, Non-RT RIC may retrieve enrichment information from 3rd party applications enabling advanced RAN slicing technology to be applied in O-RAN framework.

In order to construct AI/ML models to be deployed in the Near-RT RIC, Non-RT RIC retrieves slice specific performance metrics, configuration parameters and required attributes of the RAN slice subnets from the SMO framework. Complex problems for Near-RT RIC e.g. applying RRM policies can be tackled by learning capabilities of AI/ML. The output of these algorithms can lead non-real-time optimization of the slice specific parameters of Near-RT RIC, O-CU and O-DU over O1 interface through SMO interaction. Moreover, these performance, configuration and other slice related data are used to generate policy guidance and assist Near-RT RIC over A1 to provide closed loop slice optimization. Applying such slice optimizations in the Near-RT RIC can be used for SLA assurance and prevent SLA violations between the slices as well.

Near-RT RIC

Near-RT RIC is the component which enables near-real-time RAN slice subnet optimization through execution of slicing related xApps and communicating necessary parameters to O-CU and O-DU through E2 interface. Deployed xApps may utilize either AI/ML based models or other control schemes which can further be guided by A1 policies that are generated by Non-RT RIC.

In order to drive sliced RAN resources properly, Near-RT RIC should have the knowledge of existing RAN slice subnets as well as their requirements. This information will be received through O1 interface during provisioning of RAN slice subnets. Therefore similar to Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC will be aware of RAN slice subnets through O-RAN specific information models and provisioning procedures.

In O-RAN slicing architecture, configuration of slice resources on E2 nodes can be achieved through slow loop with O1 configuration and through fast loop with E2 configuration. This architecture enables advanced slicing use cases such as RAN slice SLA assurance and further enhances 3GPP slicing capability without misalignment. While Near-RT RIC is capable for fast-loop configuration, slicing related O1 configuration, such as RRM policy information sent to O-CU, configured by the SMO framework will be taken into account. Moreover, slice specific near-RT performance data will be monitored through E2 interface which needs proper PM mechanisms between E2 nodes and Near-RT RIC as well.

O-RAN Central Unit (O-CU)

O-CU, which includes a single O-CU-CP and possibly multiple O-CU-UP(s), which are communicating through E1 interface, needs to support slicing features as defined by 3GPP. Depending on slice requirements, O-CU-UP can be shared across slices or a specific instance of O-CU-UP can be instantiated per slice. On top of 3GPP slicing features, O-RAN further enhances slicing through the utilization of E2 interface and the assistance of Near-RT RIC dynamic slice optimizations along with the enhanced O1 interface to support additional slice configuration parameters.

O-CU stacks, which are the upper layer protocols of the RAN stack, should be slice aware and execute slice specific resource allocation and isolation strategies. These stacks are initially configured through O1 interface based on the slice specific requirements and then dynamically updated through E2 interface via Near-RT RIC for various slicing use cases.

Based on the PM requests from SMO and Near-RT RIC, O-CU may need to generate and send specific PMs through O1 and E2 interfaces respectively, where the PMs can be used for slice performance monitoring and slice SLA assurance purposes.

O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU)

O-DU, which runs the lower layer protocols of RAN stack, should support slice specific resource allocation strategies as well. Based on the initial O1 configuration of PRB allocation levels along with O-CU directives over F1 interface and the dynamic guidance received from Near-RT RIC over E2 interface, MAC layer needs to allocate and isolate relevant PRBs to specific slices.

Based on the PM requests from SMO and Near-RT RIC, O-DU may need to generate and send specific PMs through O1 and E2 interfaces respectively, where the PMs can be used for slice performance monitoring and slice SLA assurance purposes.

A1 Interface

A1, which is the interface between the Non-RT RIC and the Near-RT RIC, supports policy management, ML model management and enrichment information services [11]. These three services will be utilized for various slicing use cases, such as slice SLA assurance. Policy management will be used by Non-RT RIC to send slice specific (e.g. S-NSSAI based) policies to guide Near-RT RIC with slice resource allocations and slice specific control activities, as well as to receive slice specific policy feedback for the policies deployed on the Near-RT RIC.

For the use cases that make use of external enrichment data or where Non-RT RIC produces enrichment information, A1 enrichment interface will be used to send slice specific enrichment data to Near-RT RIC.

It should be noted that slice specific A1 policies are not persistent (do not survive the restart of Near-RT RIC) and while they may take precedence over O1 slice specific configurations, they should be aligned and not deviate significantly from O1 configurations.

Note: It is intended to add examples for the usage of A1 services for slicing use cases in the next version of this document.

E2 Interface

E2, which is the interface between the Near-RT RIC and the E2 nodes, supports E2 primitives (Report, Insert, Control and Policy) to control the services exposed by E2 nodes [12]. These primitives will be used by slice specific applications (xApps) to drive E2 nodes’ slice configurations and slice specific behaviour, such as slice based radio resource management, radio resource allocations, MAC scheduling policies and other configuration parameters used by various RAN protocol stacks.

E2 will be used to configure and receive slice specific reports and performance data from E2 nodes. These reports may include 3GPP defined slice specific PMs (such as PRB utilization, average delay, etc. [7]) and new PMs that can be defined by O-RAN to support various slicing use cases.

Note: It is intended to add examples for the usage of E2 primitives for slicing use cases in the next version of this document.

O1 Interface

O1, which is the interface between O-RAN managed elements and the management entity as defined in [9], will be used to configure slice specific parameters of O-RAN nodes based on the service requirements of the slice. 3GPP have defined some of the slice specific information models in TS 28.541 [6], including the RRM policy attributes to provide the ratio of PRBs and the split of these PRBs among slices. To support O-RAN slicing use cases and their requirements, 3GPP information models may be extended and additional information models may be defined to capture slice profiles and slice specific configuration parameters, which will be carried over O1 interface as well.

O1 will also be used to configure and gather slice specific performance metrics and slice specific faults from O-RAN nodes.

Note: It is intended to add examples for the usage of O1 for the configuration, performance and fault management of slicing use cases in the next version of this document.

O2 Interface

O2, which is the interface between the SMO and O-Cloud as introduced in [13], will be used for life cycle management of virtual O-RAN network functions. As part of RAN NSSI creation and provisioning, RAN NSSMF, in interaction with SMO, triggers the instantiation of necessary O-RAN functions (such as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU) based on slice requirements. After the creation of RAN NSSI, NSSMF in interaction with SMO can execute NSSI modification and NSSI deletion procedures.

Since Non-RT RIC is part of SMO and would be instantiated along with other SMO functions, O2 is not expected to be used for lifecycle management of Non-RT RIC.

Note: It is intended to add examples for the usage of O2 for slice lifecycle management of O-RAN network functions in the next version of this document.

Annex A (informative): Additional Information

A.1	Implementation Options

This section presents example deployment options for various SMO options.

A.1.1	3GPP and ETSI NFV-MANO based O-RAN Slicing Architecture Implementation Option

Figure A.1.1-1: O-RAN Slicing Reference Architecture (ETSI NFV-MANO based example)

In Figure A.1.1-1, a 3GPP - ETSI NFV-MANO based example of O-RAN slicing reference architecture and interfaces is shown to describe the relationship between 3GPP defined slice management functions (NSMF, NSSMF), 3GPP defined management functions (Network Function Management Function, NFMF [5]) and O-RAN network functions in terms of slice lifecycle management and slice configuration procedures. Life Cycle Management (LCM) procedures for mobile networks that include virtualized network functions (VNFs) as well as addition of physical network functions (PNFs) to network service (NS) instances are described in 3GPP TS28.526 [4].

A.1.2	ONAP based O-RAN Slicing Architecture Implementation Option

Figure A.1.2-1: Example architecture depiction for ONAP based O-RAN Slicing support

In A.1.2-1, current version of ONAP - O-RAN slicing reference architecture is depicted (based on ONAP G-release). In this architecture, one option is RAN NSSMF being located within SMO and is responsible for the entire RAN subnet, including the O-RAN NFs and the related O-RAN transport network components; Fronthaul interface (FH) beween O-RU and O-DU and Midhaul interface (MH) between O-DU and O-CU. RAN NSSMF determines slice specific configuration of O-RAN NFs based on SliceProfile received from NSMF and determines the necessary slice specific requirements for FH and MH interface triggering Transport Network Management Domain (TN MD) to execute the actual configuration of FH and MH interface. ETSI ZSM based Management Domain approach is adopted for TN management.
