2.2.2 TLS Protocol profiles specifications 14 
The Mozilla Operations Security and Enterprise Information Security teams maintains a web page [7] that serves as a 15 
reference guide for navigating the TLS landscape. Mozilla divides the TLS ciphers into three classifications: Modern, 16 
Intermediate and Old. 17 
• Modern: Modern clients that support TLS 1.3, with no need for backwards compatibility 18 
• Intermediate: Recommended configuration for a general-purpose server 19 
• Old: Services accessed by very old clients or libraries, such as Internet Explorer 8 (Windows XP), Java 6, or 20 
OpenSSL 0.9.8 21 
O-RAN shall support all Intermediate ciphers, and should support all Modern ciphers. O -RAN implementations that use 22 
TLS 1.3 shall use Modern ciphers.  23 
Note that TLS1.3 will be made mandatory in O-RAN future specifications. (as per NIST guidelines [19]) 24 
 25 
2.2.2.1 Intermediate Ciphers for TLS 1.2 26 
This is the required set of ciphers, protocols, TLS curves, supported certificate types, Diffie-Hellman parameter size, 27 
etc. The Intermediate ciphers and configuration parameters are highly secure and compatible with nearly every client 28 
released in the last five (or more) years. Note that this document uses the IANA cipher naming conventions [5]  29 
• Cipher suites (TLS 1.2): 30

O-RAN.SFG.Security-Protocols-Specifications-v01.00 
Annex ZZZ : O-RAN Adopter License Agreement 1 
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O- RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER 2 
AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 3 
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O -RAN Alliance and the 4 
entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”). 5 
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification. 6 
Section 1: DEFINITIONS 7 
1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with 8 
another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of 9 
fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity. 10 
1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether implemented in hardware, 11 
software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification. 12 
1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their 13 
Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications. 14 
1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does 15 
not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O -RAN 16 
Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates. 17 
1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design 18 
patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable  by a Member, 19 
Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) 20 
such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment of 21 
consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering 22 
any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible 23 
on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art 24 
generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O -RAN Alliance or the date the patent 25 
claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate 26 
a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a 27 
Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent 28 
claims shall be considered Necessary Claims. 29 
1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, 30 
Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term 31 
allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the 32 
licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates. 33 
Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE 34 
2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, 35 
nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN 36 
Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in 37 
furtherance of implementations of an O-RAN 38 
Specification. 39 
2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written 40 
agreement with O-RAN Alliance. 41 
Section 3: FRAND LICENSE 42 
3.1 Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separate 43 
Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non- Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and 44 
conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to 45 
Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, 46 
use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such 47 
license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant  Implementation is incorporated 48 
that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal 49

O-RAN.SFG.Security-Protocols-Specifications-v01.00 
grant to Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors, as set forth in Section 3.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the 1 
foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Adopter’s distributors and the use by the Adopter’s 2 
customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations. 3 
3.2 Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has 4 
reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter 5 
is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and 6 
its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees. 7 
3.3 Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License 8
