6	AAL Profile Specifications

6.1 	Profile Specifications Overview

This section contains information for each AAL Profile that is specified in this present document. An AAL Profile may provide APIs for a specific profile configuration that may be required in addition to the general AAL configuration APIs. AAL Profile specific configuration shall be done on a per AAL-LPU basis. Each AAL Profile shall define a list of capabilities that will be used to define the operations supported by the AAL-LPU.

A normative stage-3 definition for this High-PHY Profile specification is FFS and could leverage aspects of various options including but not limited to SCF-222.

An informative example of one possible mapping of the stage-2 HI-PHY Profile in this document is provided in Annex A.

6.1.1 	Naming

Parameters and capabilities based on this stage-2 specification shall follow the following naming guidelines:

Parameter and capability names shall start with a lowercase letter;

No spaces may be used in the names;

The names shall consist only of letters and digits and hyphens;

The first letter of each non-initial word in a name shall be capitalized.

Acronyms in the beginning of a parameter are lower case, uppercase otherwise

Acronyms are hyphenated from preceding or succeeding upper case

6.2	O-DU AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY Profile Specification

This profile provides acceleration functionality for the following channels and signals:

PDSCH (including Data, DM-RS and PT-RS)

PDCCH (including Data and DM-RS)

CSI-RS

SSB (Including PSS, SSS and PBCH)

This clause presents parametrization for each of these channels and signals, and pertinent carrier configuration.

6.2.1	Profile Operation

The AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY Profile interface shall work on a slot basis, where the slot, numerology and SFN are signaled for the API.

The input data is specific to each downlink channel composing the profile. The output data is a set of C/U-Plane O-RAN Fronthaul (OFH) packets [8].

The AAL-LPU interfaces directly with the OFH and is responsible for handling its exchange of information with OFH.

As much as possible, parameter redundancy should be avoided. Where this is not possible, the AAL-LPU shall assume that redundant parameters are consistent.

6.2.2	Summary of Capabilities

The AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY Profile capabilities shall be reported to the application.

Table 6.2.2-1 lists a subset of the AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY profile capabilities that should be reported to the application with respect to the acceleration of the various channel functionality and interaction.

NOTE: Additional capabilities can also be reported by the AALI implementation.

6.3	O-DU AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY Profile Specification

This profile provides acceleration functionality for the following channels and signals:

PUSCH (including Data, DM-RS and PT-RS)

PUCCH (Data) – Format 0

PUCCH (including Data and DM-RS) – Format 1

PUCCH (including Data and DM-RS) – Formats 2, 3, 4

SRS

PRACH

This section presents parametrization for each of these channels and signals, and pertinent carrier configuration.

6.3.1	Profile Operation

The AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY Profile interface shall work on a slot basis. An operation can be performed one slot at a time, where the slot, numerology and SFN are signaled for the API.

The output data is specific to each uplink channel composing the profile.

The input data consists of:

a set of AAL Application-supplied parameters for each of the modelled uplink channels

a set of U-Plane OFH packets.

For the OFH packets, the AAL-LPU interfaces directly with the OFH and is responsible for handling its exchange of information with OFH.

As much as possible, parameter redundancy should be avoided. Where this is not possible, the AAL-LPU can assume that redundant parameters are consistent.

6.3.2	Summary of Capabilities

The AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY Profile capabilities shall be reported to the application.

Table 6.3.2-1 lists a subset of the AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY profile capabilities that should be reported to the application with respect the acceleration of the various channel functionalities and interaction.

NOTE: Additional capabilities can also be reported by the AALI implementation.

6.3.4.1	PUCCH input and output for AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY Profile

The AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY profile shall signal PUCCH resource(s) per slot.

From the AAL Application, the PUCCH interface receives the associated parameters for the configuration of the PUCCH resource.

The output data consists of:

the CRC or detection status of the PUCCH UCI payload (HARQ, SR or CSI), as well as related metrics (e.g. SINR)

The UCI Payload: HARQ, SR (Formats 0/1) or transparent UCI payload(s) (Formats 2/3/4).

6.3.4.2	PUCCH Parameters

The following parameters are required to be supported by the AALI implementation when offloading operations. The AAL Application shall supply all relevant parameters; for ease of reading, the parameters are grouped as follows, in alignment with the O-RAN AAL GAnP document [7]: PUCCH Format 0, PUCCH Format 1 (UCI and DMRS), PUCCH Formats 2/3/4 (UCI and DMRS). Only one of these sets of parameters is applicable to any one PUCCH resource:

Annex A [informative] Stage-3 Support for AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY and AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY using FAPI

This annex illustrates how SCF-222 [i.1] and SCF-223 [i.2] can be used to provide stage-3 support for the AAL_DOWNLINK_High-PHY and AAL_UPLINK_High-PHY profiles in this document.

In particular:

Profile capabilities (sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.2) and Configurations (sections 6.2.2b and 6.3.2b) are supported via the SCF P5 interface

Profile slot-level APIs (DL sections 6.2.3 – 6.2.7, UL sections 6.3.3 – 6.3.7) are supported via the SCF P7 interface

Channel Models referenced in this document correspond to PDUs, which are transported over SCF P7 APIs in SCF-222

NOTE:

this illustration does not preclude other stage-3 implementations of the the stage-2 APIs referenced this document, nor does it preclude the addition of other features or extensions in the future.

alignment of this document with non-O-RAN Alliance specifications is not required.

An illustration of this stage-3 support is further illustrated below for mapping of the CSI-RS Channel Model parameters from section 6.2.5 to CSI-RS PDU and related parameters in SCF-222 [i.1] and SCF-223 [i.2]:
