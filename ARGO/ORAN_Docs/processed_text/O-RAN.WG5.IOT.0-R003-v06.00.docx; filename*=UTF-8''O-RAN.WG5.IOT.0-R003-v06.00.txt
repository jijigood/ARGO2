Interoperability Measurements

2.1	Interoperability Test Definitions

2.1.1 	Test Configurations

Interoperability testing is performed to prove that the end-to-end functionality between the radio access network nodes is as per specified in the O-RAN NR C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles specifications on which these components are based. This requires system level testing of the radio access network nodes requiring interoperability testing as an integrated system.

Figure 2-1 shows the EN-DC Overall Architecture [2]. The en-gNB may consist of a gNB-CU and one or more gNB-DU(s). A gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is connected via the F1 interface.

2.1.1.1 	Device Under Test (DUT) and System Under Test (SUT)

The case where the DUTs for X2, F1 and Xn interoperability tests are provided by different vendors is the focus of this document, but the case where both are from the same vendor is also valid.

Table 2-1 summarizes the DUTs and SUTs for X2, F1 and Xn interoperability testing scenarios.

The test configurations will involve defining the cardinality between the X DUT NE1(s) and Y DUT NE2(s) as part of the test scenario which will determine the configuration required. The simplest test configuration involves a single DUT NE1 and a single DUT NE2 ie, X=Y=1.

Figure 2-3, 2-4 and 2-5 show the SUT configurations for X2, F1 and Xn interoperability testing, respectively.

External physical connections between the X DUT NE1(s) and Y DUT NE2(s) are out of scope of this specification.

2.1.1.2 	Testing Tools

One of the key objectives of interoperability testing is to validate the functionality of production grade DUTs. Hence it is important to ensure that the DUTs are not negatively impacted with the utilization of internal functions solely to support interoperability testing, ie, DUTs are not expected to be testing tools when deployed in production networks and therefore DUTs should not be used as testing tools during interoperability tests.

Interoperability tests are performed with a set of testing tools which are used to both apply active stimulus and as well as passive monitoring and measurements of the DUTs.

2.1.1.2.1 	Testing Tools Summary

Table 2-2: Testing Tools Summary and Applicability to X2, F1 and Xn Interoperability Testing

2.1.1.2.2 	Testing Tools Details

This section describes details of the testing tools listed in Table 2-2.

Active stimulus testing tools

This paragraph shows details of active stimulus testing tools for X2, F1 and Xn interfaces interoperability testing.

NOTE: The number allocated to each testing tool below corresponds to the number on the list in Table 2-2.

No. 1: Test UEs and/or UE emulator: used to generate stateful UE connections and traffic to validate the DUTs implementation of the X2, F1 and Xn interface protocols as these are stimulated by the 3GPP upper layer protocols:

Required so that the DUTs do not need to be put into a “test mode” which does not happen in live deployments

Test UEs and UE emulator will be required to support EN-DC operations for X2 and F1 interoperability testing. Test UEs and UE emulator will be required to support Standalone (SA) mode for Xn interoperability testing

Test UEs will require SIM cards which are pre-provisioned with subscriber profiles. UEs used for testing can be simpler to setup but given that these Test UEs are designed as commercial UEs with possibly certain diagnostic functions enabled for logging purposes, they are limited in terms of configurability

UE emulator will require SIM profile configuration with the subscriber’s profiles. UE emulator can be used in test scenarios which require multiple UE sessions, more flexibility and configurability to help drive test scenarios

RF connection between the Test UEs or UE emulator with the DUTs namely the eNB, en-gNB and gNB will be either through cabled connection or Over-The-Air (OTA)

No. 2: Core or Core emulator: used to terminate stateful NAS sessions with Test UEs and/or UE emulator and stateful S1 or NG sessions with the DUTs:

Required so that the DUTs do not need to be put into a “test mode” which does not happen in live deployments

Core or Core emulator will be required to support EPC with EN-DC capabilities for X2 and F1 interoperability testing. Core or Core emulator will be required to support 5GC with SA capabilities for Xn and F1 interoperability testing

External physical connection between Core or Core emulator and eNB, en-gNB and gNB is out of scope of this specification

No. 4: Application Test Server: An endpoint application test traffic emulator which can be used to originate and/or terminate various traffic streams to or from the Test UEs or UE emulator, respectively. It may provide one or more of these options:

Stateful traffic, eg, TCP, TWAMP

Stateless traffic, eg, UDP

Required to place traffic load on the DUT

External physical connection between Application Test Server and Core or Core emulator is out of scope of the specification

Active stimulus testing tools are connected DUTs. The following describes the interoperability test setup for X2, F1, and Xn.

X2 IOT Setup

Figure 2-6 shows the test setup for X2 interoperability testing with the DUTs eNB, en-gNB and their connections to active stimulus testing tools No. 1, 2, and 4.

Figure 2-6: X2 IOT setup

In addition to the above active stimulus testing tools, following testing tools are also used for certain X2 IOT tests.

No. 3: eNB or eNB emulator: used to support Master Node (eNB) (DUT) to eNB change test case:

Required so that the Master Node (eNB) which is the DUT does not need to be put into a “test mode” which does not happen in live deployments

External physical connection between eNB or eNB emulator and Master Node (eNB) is out of scope of this specification

No. 6: Network Impairment Emulator: used to create impairments such as packet discards over the network interfaces. This emulator is connected in an in-line mode such as between the eNB and en-gNB over the X2 interface

F1 IOT setup (EN-DC)

Figure 2-7 shows the test setup for F1 interoperability testing with the en-gNB consisting of DUTs gNB-CU, gNB-DU and their connections to active stimulus testing tools No. 1, 2, and 4.

Figure 2-7: F1 IOT setup

In addition to the above active stimulus testing tools, following testing tools are also used for certain F1 IOT tests.

No. 3: eNB or eNB emulator: used to support F1 interoperability testing of the gNB-CU and gNB-DU with both DUTs belonging to the en-gNB:

Required so that the DUTs (gNB-CU, gNB-DU) do not need to be put into a “test mode” which does not happen in live deployments

External physical connection between the eNB or the eNB emulator and the gNB-CU is out of scope of this specification

F1 IOT setup (SA)

Figure 2-7a shows the test setup for F1 interoperability testing with the gNB consisting of DUTs gNB-CU, gNB-DU and their connections to active stimulus testing tools No. 1, 2, and 4.

Figure 2-7a: F1 IOT setup

Xn IOT setup

Figure 2-8 shows the test setup for Xn interoperability testing with the gNBs (DUTs) and their connections to active stimulus testing tools No. 1, 2, and 4.

Figure 2-8: Xn IOT setup

Active stimulus testing tools for simplified connection between DUTs and Test UEs or UE emulator

Connecting the Test UEs and/or UE emulator to the eNB, en-gNB and gNB through the radio interface can be rather complex to setup and configure (particularly with Massive MIMO antennas in FR1 and FR2).

Given that the objective of this test specification is to validate the interoperability between the radio access network nodes over the X2, F1 and Xn interface and protocols, the test setup can be simplified if there can be alternative means of connecting the Test UEs and/or UE emulator to the DUTs namely the eNB, en-gNB and gNB in the various interoperability test setups.

The following describes the interoperability test setup for X2, F1, and Xn in case that O-DU and/or O-RU emulators are used.

X2 IOT setup with O-DU & O-RU emulator

For X2 interoperability testing, in the case where the en-gNB (DUT) implements the 3GPP F1 split architecture, the en-gNB entity which is connected to the eNB over the X2 interface operates the O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP functions. The test setup can be simplified by connecting the UE emulator to the en-gNB (functionality corresponding to the O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP) through the O-DU & O-RU emulator over cabled (ethernet) connection. The O-DU & O-RU emulator belong to the en-gNB functionality in this test setup. Refer to [4] for the definition of the O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU.

No. 7: O-DU & O-RU emulator: used to terminate stateful F1 sessions with the en-gNB (DUT) in the X2 interoperability test setup:

Simplify test setup by connecting the Test UEs and/or UE emulator to the en-gNB (functionality corresponding to the O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP)

External physical connection between the O-DU & O-RU emulator and the en-gNB is out of scope of this specification

Figure 2-9 shows the test setup for eNB, en-gNB and their connections to the above listed active stimulus testing tools now including the O-DU and O-RU emulator connected to the en-gNB (DUT).

Figure 2-9: IOT setup with en-gNB configured with 3GPP F1 split

Xn IOT Setup with O-DU & O-RU emulator

For Xn interoperability testing, in the case where one or both of the gNBs (DUT) implement(s) the 3GPP F1 split architecture, the gNB(s) operate(s) the O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP functions. The test setup can be simplified by connecting the UE emulator to the gNB(s) (functionality corresponding to the O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP) through the O-DU & O-RU emulator over cabled (ethernet) connection. The O-DU & O-RU emulator belong to the gNB functionality in this test setup. Refer to [4] for the definition of the O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU.

No. 7: O-DU & O-RU emulator: used to terminate stateful F1 sessions with the gNB(s) (DUT) in the Xn interoperability test setup:

Simplify test setup by connecting the Test UEs and/or UE emulator to the gNB(s) (functionality corresponding to the O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP)

External physical connection between the O-DU & O-RU emulator and the gNB(s) is out of scope of this specification

Figure 2-10 shows the test setup for gNBs and their connections to the above listed active stimulus testing tools now including the O-DU & O-RU emulator connected to one of the gNBs (DUT) which has implemented the 3GPP F1 split architecture. In the case that both gNBs (DUTs) implement the 3GPP F1 split architecture, then the O-DU & O-RU emulator can be connected to both the gNBs (DUTs).

Figure 2-10: Xn IOT setup with one of the gNBs configured with 3GPP F1 split

X2 IOT setup with O-RU emulator

Passive monitoring and measurements testing tools

This paragraph shows details of passive monitoring and measurements testing tools for X2, F1 and Xn interfaces interoperability testing.

NOTE: The number allocated to each testing tool below corresponds to the number on the list in Table 2-2.

No. 5: Protocol Analyzer: used for protocol analysis and measurements of X2 and Xn interfaces C-Plane and U-Plane protocols; S1-U and NG-U interface protocols, and F1 interface C-Plane and U-Plane protocols:

Test case validation and troubleshooting purposes which can help with test setup validation and root cause analysis for test cases which fail

Monitoring traffic from the X2, F1, Xn, S1-U and NG-U interfaces typically through a tap or span port. Taps are typically preferred as span ports are less reliable but can be used if taps are not readily available in the test lab. Connectivity specifics (eg, number of 10/25/40/100 GE) is out of scope of this specification

NOTE:  If IPsec encryption (non-Null) is applied to the X2, F1, Xn, S1-U and NG-U interfaces, the Protocol Analyzer cannot be used to reliably analyze the procedures and protocols exchanged over these interfaces. Decryption of IPsec protected traffic for lab testing purpose can be possible but processing intensive particularly when dealing with dynamic security parameters

No.1 and 10 Test UE logging tool and/or UE emulator: used to produce measurements and logs:

Measurements and KPIs logs for test case validation and reporting

Diagnostics logs for troubleshooting purposes which can help with test setup validation and root cause analysis for failed test cases

Diagnostics mode shall be enabled on the Test UEs for diagnostic logging purposes. Device logging tools shall be connected to the Test UEs for logging purposes

UEs used for testing can be simpler to setup but given that these Test UEs are designed as commercial UEs, they are limited in terms of diagnostic logging capabilities due to limited processing and buffer space

UE emulator can be used in test scenarios which require extensive diagnostics capabilities

No. 9: Test results and KPIs reporting which can be provided through one or more of these options:

UE logging tools which are connected to the Test UEs

UE emulator reporting dashboard typically built in as part of the UE emulator solution

External dashboard and reporting applications

Passive monitoring and measurements testing tools are also connected DUTs. Followings describe interoperability test setup for X2, F1, and Xn.

2.1.1.3 	Assumptions

In this version of the specification, the following assumptions apply:

Management Plane - DUTs are in service and running in normal operating state. M-Plane interactions between the DUTs and Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) are out of scope in this version of the specification.

Synchronization Plane - all the components including the DUTs and the Testing Tools are required to be synchronized to a common system time and master time source unless otherwise stated. S-Plane test setup details are out of scope in this version of the specification.

Transport Plane – transport aspects between the DUTs and between the DUTs to the Test Equipment are out of scope in this version of the specification, but the WG5 Transport Specification [6] can be used as a reference. Examples of transport aspects include Physical Connectivity Interface (eg, connectivity rates), Data Link Layer Interface (layer 2 eg, VLAN, QoS marking), Network Layer Interface (layer 3 eg, IP version), (layer 4 eg, SCTP), Security (eg, IPsec).

All wireline transport interfaces conform to ideal conditions (no impairments).

All wireless connections (air interface) conform to ideal conditions (no impairments) unless otherwise stated in test cases which may have requirements to impair the wireless connections in order to stimulate handover scenarios for example.

All wireless connections which conform to ideal conditions (no impairments) and adopt 3GPP approaches for “ideal” RF environment test setup.

All DUTs comply with the same version or compatible versions of the O-RAN WG5 C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles.

All elements in the interoperability test and the supporting test environment, where 3GPP support is relevant, comply with the same version or compatible versions of the 3GPP Specifications.

2.1.1.4 	Specifications to be used for testing

In this version of the specification, the following sets of specifications and releases/versions shall be supported

O-RAN WG5:

NR C-Plane profile [2]

NR U-Plane profile [3]

3GPP

3GPP Release and Version as listed in O-RAN WG5 NR C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles specifications. It is important to ensure that all DUTs and Testing Tools use compatible release/version of the 3GPP specifications.

2.1.1.5 	Standard Test Configuration

Most interoperability tests will use a standard test configuration although individual tests are expected to deviate from this in some way. By defining the standard test configuration, an understanding of how the test setup is configured can be gained, thereafter examining individual tests can reveal the specific deviations from the standard test configuration and these specific deviations will be specified in each of the test cases

The standard test setup involves a single DUT NE1 and a single DUT NE2 with DUT NE1 and DUT NE2 as specified in Table 2-1 in accordance with the interoperability test interfaces. Test cases which require more than a single DUT NE1 or DUT NE2 will specify the number of DUT NE1 and DUT NE2 required as part of the test case.

IPsec encryption of the interface(s) under test is optional. If IPsec encryption with non-NULL encryption is enabled as part of the test setup, it would not be possible to perform test verification using the Protocol Analyzer without the Protocol Analyzer performing IPsec decryption. Details about IPsec decryption is out of scope of this specification.

2.2.1.7 	Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x)

2.2.1.7.1 	Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure with eNB and en-gNB from different vendors can be successfully completed; conforming to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2] Section 5.1.1.

2.2.1.7.2 	Minimum Requirements

DUTs: Single eNB and single en-gNB:

DUTs shall apply the parameter condition specified in 5.1.1 of the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

The coverage of eNB cell and en-gNB cell overlap

Testing tools which are required for this test scenario:

Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting for both LTE and NR: used to perform Secondary Node Addition procedure

Core or Core emulator (EPC with EN-DC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol

Application test server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side

Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe X2 procedural flows and content, S1-U UP content

2.2.1.7.3 	Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.2 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case:

EN-DC X2 setup procedure has been successfully completed between the eNB and en-gNB according to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the MN (eNB) cell and SN (en-gNB) cell

Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Attach procedure and Service Request procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] has been successfully completed

Secondary node has not yet been added to the Test UE or UE emulator

Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

2.2.1.7.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the eNB to the en-gNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the eNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the addition of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the en-gNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the SgNB Addition Request procedure.

Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the en-gNB.

This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the en-gNB to the eNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Release (MN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT and the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

Provoke a Radio Link Failure in SCG, so MN receives SCG Failure Information NR message from the UE. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the en-gNB cell.

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Change (MN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source en-gNB to the eNB and from the eNB to the target en-gNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Change (MN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the source en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the change of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform Secondary Node Change Procedure from MN (eNB) side.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) and the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) simultaneously. In this specific case, the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the Secondary Node Change procedure.

Observe that data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator is ongoing after Secondary Node Change.

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the target en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the target en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the target en-gNB

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the source en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the change of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10], 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform Secondary Node Change Procedure from Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) and Target en-gNB cell (T-SN).

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

Move the Test UE or UE emulator from the coverage area of Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) towards Target en-gNB cell (T-SN). One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) and the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) simultaneously. In this specific case, the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the SN change procedure from S-SN to T-TN.

Observe that data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator is ongoing after Secondary Node Change.

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the target en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the target en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the target en-gNB.

2.2.1.13.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Master Node to eNB Change procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the en-gNB to the source eNB over the X2 interface during the Master Node to eNB Change procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform the Master Node to eNB Change Procedure.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

The handover to Target eNB is decided by the Master Node based on the Measurement Report sent from the Test UE or UE emulator. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and Master Node cell and the eNB cell simultaneously. In this specific case, the Master Node cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the eNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the Master Node to eNB Change procedure.

Observe that data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator is ongoing after the Master Node to eNB Change.

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during MCG Bearer(s) operation. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the MN Source Cell and the Target Cell simultaneously. In this specific case, the MN Source Cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target Cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the handover from the Source Cell to the Target Cell.

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration – full configuration option procedure with eNB and en-gNB from different vendors can be successfully completed; conforming to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2] Section 5.6.15.

2.2.1.15.2 	Minimum Requirements

DUTs: Single eNB and single en-gNB:

DUTs shall apply the parameter condition specified in 5.6.15 of NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

The coverage of eNB cell and en-gNB cells overlap

en-gNB has at least 2 Cells configured and in operation

Testing tools which are required for this test scenario:

Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting both LTE and NR: used to perform PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration procedure

Core or Core emulator (EPC with EN-DC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol

Application test server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side

Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe X2 procedural flows and content

2.2.1.15.3 	Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.2 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case:

EN-DC X2 Setup procedure has been successfully completed between the eNB and en-gNB according to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the MN (eNB) cell and one SN (en-gNB) cell

Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Attach procedure and Service Request procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] has been successfully completed

Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure between the eNB and en-gNB has been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

2.2.1.15.4 	Procedure

Perform PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration – full configuration option procedure.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

The condition by which UE sends an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN depends on the configuration done by MN. Still, we can create a situation where PSCell Change occurs. There should be at least two en-gNB cells within the coverage of a cell under eNB. The first cell under en-gNB which is PSCell and the second cell under en-gNB which is not PSCell. If the tester manually degrades the radio quality of the first en-gNB cell this can be the trigger of the PSCell Change procedure.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the first en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the first en-gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the PSCell Change procedure.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting both LTE and NR: used to perform PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration procedure

Core or Core emulator (EPC with EN-DC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol

Application test server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side

Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe X2 procedural flows and contents

2.2.1.16.3 	Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.2 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case:

EN-DC X2 setup procedure has been successfully completed between the eNB and en-gNB according to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the eNB cell and one en-gNB cell

Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Attach procedure and Service Request procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] has been completed

Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure between the eNB and en-gNB has been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

2.2.1.16.4 	Procedure

Perform PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration – delta configuration option procedure.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

The condition by which UE sends an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN depends on the configuration done by MN. Still, we can create a situation where PSCell Change occurs. There should be at least two en-gNB cells within the coverage of a cell under eNB. The first cell under en-gNB which is PSCell and the second cell under en-gNB which is not PSCell. If the tester manually degrades the radio quality of the first en-gNB cell, this can be the trigger of the PSCell Change procedure.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the first en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the first en-gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the PSCell Change procedure.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data) or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Attach procedure and Service Request procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] has been successfully completed

Secondary Node Addition (eg, SN terminated split bearer or SN terminated SCG bearer) procedure between the eNB and en-gNB has been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

2.2.1.23.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data transferring function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Modification (MN Initiated, addition of SN terminated split bearer) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred from the eNB to the en-gNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Modification (MN Initiated, addition of SN terminated split bearer) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

Perform Secondary Node Modification with addition of SN terminated split bearer procedure from MN (eNB) side

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT:

Trigger from Core or Core emulator (EPC with EN-DC capabilities) to add a new E-RAB for this Test UE or UE emulator

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds on the new bearer

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly on the new established SN terminated split bearer in above step 2. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

2.2.1.34.4 	Procedures

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during the UE measurement transfer procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform UE measurement transfer procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

The condition by which UE sends an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN depends on the configuration done by MN. Still, we can create a situation where UE measurement transfer occurs. There should be at least two en-gNB cells within the coverage of a cell under eNB. The first cell under en-gNB which is PSCell and the second cell under en-gNB which is not PSCell. If the tester manually degrades the radio quality of the first en-gNB cell this can be the trigger of the UE measurement transfer procedure.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the first en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the first en-gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the UE measurement transfer procedure.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and source eNB (S-MN) and the target eNB (T-MN) simultaneously. In this specific case, the source eNB (S-MN) cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the target eNB (T-MN) cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the measurement report to be sent to the source eNB (S-MN).

The target eNB (T-MN) decides to change the Secondary Node, the target eNB (T-MN) sends the SgNB Addition Request to the target gNB (T-SN).

Observe that data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator is ongoing after Inter-Master Node Handover

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the target en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the target en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the target en-gNB.

All U-Plane data transmitted by the Test UE or emulated UE via LTE RAT (ie, all U-Plane data to be transferred from eNB to target en-gNB) is recorded in the X2 logs

Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible

2.4.1.2.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Inter gNB Handover procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source gNB to the target gNB over the Xn interface during the Inter gNB Handover procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the source gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the Inter gNB Handover.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10], 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform Inter gNB Handover Procedure from Source gNB cell and Target gNB cell.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

Move the Test UE or UE emulator from the coverage area of source gNB cell towards target gNB cell. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the source gNB cell and the target gNB cell simultaneously. In this specific case, the source gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the target gNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the Inter gNB Handover.

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful Inter gNB Handover Procedure.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10], 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure with two gNBs, hereafter MgNB and SgNB respectively, from different vendors can be successfully completed, conforming to the NR C-plane profile specification [2] section 7.1.1.

2.4.1.3.2 	Minimum Requirements

DUTs: MgNB and SgNB:

DUTs shall apply the parameter condition specified in 7.1.1 of the NR C-plane profile specification [2]

The coverages of MgNB cell and SgNB cell overlap each other.

Testing tools which are required for this test scenario:

Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting NR and NR-DC: used to perform S-NG-RAN Node Addition

Core or Core emulator (5GC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol

Application Test Server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side

Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe both Xn link procedural flows and content, and NG-U UP content

2.4.1.3.3 	Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.4 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case:

Xn Setup procedure has been successfully completed between MgNB and SgNB according to the NR C-plane profile specification [2]

Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Registration procedure and Service Request procedure specified in the NR C-plane profile specification [2] has been successfully completed

Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of MgNB cell and SgNB cell

Data transfer between the application test server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible

2.4.1.3.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator via MgNB.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the MgNB to the SgNB over the Xn interface during the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the MgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the addition of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Perform S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the SgNB cell. In this specific case, the SgNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure.

Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during SN terminated Split Bearer(s) operation in NR-DC. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the Xn in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the SN terminated Split Bearer(s) usage of both MgNB and SgNB is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start distributing user plane data to the gNB via the Xn interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both MgNB and SgNB, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the SgNB to the MgNB, via the established MgNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via MgNB

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the SgNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the MgNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the MgNB, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via MgNB when it is used by the SgNB.

2.4.1.8.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the M-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release with keeping UE procedure.

2.4.1.9 	S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release

2.4.1.9.1 	Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release procedure with MN (MgNB) and SN (SgNB) from different vendors can be successfully completed, conforming to the NR C-plane profile specification [2] section 7.3.3.

2.4.1.9.2 	Minimum Requirements

DUTs: Two gNBs (MgNB – MN, SgNB – SN):

DUTs shall apply the parameter condition specified in 7.3.3 of the NR C-plane profile specification [2]

The coverage of MgNB cell (MN) and SgNB cell (SN) overlap

Testing tools which are required for this test scenario:

Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting NR and NR-DC: used to perform S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release

Core or Core emulator (5GC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol

Application Test Server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side

Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe Xn procedural flows and content

2.4.1.9.3 	Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.4 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case

Xn Setup procedure has been successfully completed between the MgNB and SgNB according to the NR C-plane profile specification [2]

Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Registration procedure and Service Request procedure specified in the NR C-plane profile specification [2] has been successfully completed

Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the MgNB cell and SgNB cell

Data transfer between the application test server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible

S-NG-RAN NODE ADDITION procedure between the MgNB and SgNB been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

2.4.1.9.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

There are two options for this procedure, as shown in Figure 7.3.3.1-1 in the NR C-plane profile specification [2].

If M-NG-RAN will keep this UE in MN side (ie, Opt1), the notes in step 1 are as follows.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the SgNB to the MgNB over the Xn interface during the S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

If M-NG-RAN will not keep this UE in MN side (ie, Opt2), the notes in step 1 is as follow.

It should be noted that this test case does not specify the test data pattern generated by the Application Test Server, but it is recommended that the test data pattern should include some level of randomness (ie, avoiding all zeros).

Perform S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release

A few examples of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) are listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

Block cell in SgNB. One of the possible methods can be to make use of the O&M command in the SgNB to block the cell

Provoke conditions in a way that the SgNB detects that the RLC exceeds its maximum downlink retransmission. One of the possible methods can be to vary the channel conditions between the SgNB and the Test UE or UE emulator so that the emulated interference can be significant enough to increase RLC retransmissions to exceed the maximum downlink retransmission level

The procedure for Opt1 and opt2 is as follows.

In Opt1, perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful S-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

In Opt2, stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator.

2.4.1.12.4 	Procedure

Perform data transfer in the downlink direction between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Master Node to gNB Change procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the SgNB to the MgNB over the Xn interface during the Master Node to gNB Change procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

A few examples of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) are listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

The handover to T-gNB is decided by the Master Node based on the Measurement Report sent from the Test UE or UE emulator.

In this specific case, the Master Node cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the T-gNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the Master Node to gNB Change procedure.

Observe that data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator is ongoing after the Master Node to gNB Change

Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator

Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful Master Node to gNB Change. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).
