4	General O-RAN architecture principles

This clause contains the general O-RAN architecture principles as described below.

The O-RAN architecture, interface specifications, and terminology shall be consistent with 3GPP architecture, interface specifications, and terminology with additions to accommodate O-RAN specific features.

This document represents the O-RAN architecture at the time of its publication and may evolve as deemed appropriate by the O-RAN ALLIANCE.

The O-RAN architecture includes a logical representation of a Radio Access Network (RAN) which extends the 3GPP specified RAN and consists of logical NFs or logical nodes (as per 3GPP TS 38.300 [8] and TR 21.905 [i.1]).

NOTE: Therefore, the terms O-RAN NFs as well as O-RAN nodes are used interchangeably to refer to some of the logical O-RAN entities, according to the context used in that particular statement. In any case, they always refer to a logical entity and not to a physical or cloudified instantiation of an O-RAN NF or an O-RAN node.

5	O-RAN architecture

5.1	Overall architecture of O-RAN

Figure 5.11 below provides a high-level view of the O-RAN architecture.  It shows that the interfaces – A1, O1, Open Fronthaul M-plane and O2 – connecting SMO (Service Management and Orchestration) framework to O-RAN Network Functions and to O-Cloud. As depicted in this figure, the O-Cloud includes the O-Cloud Notification interface as specified in O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers [28] is available for the relevant O-RAN Network Functions (i.e., Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU) to receive O-Cloud related notifications.

Figure 5.11 below also illustrates that the O-RAN Network Functions can be hosted on the O-Cloud or on customized hardware.

All O-RAN NFs, except O-RU, are managed via the O1 interface to an authorized SMO framework.

The O1 interface exposes management services for the O-RAN NFs that are managed individually or together, as specified in OAM Architecture[34].

The Open Fronthaul M-plane interface, between SMO and O-RU, supports the O-RU management in hybrid mode, as specified in Open FH M-Plane [24].

O-RAN NFs instantiated on the O-Cloud may utilize the APIs exposed by the Accelerator Abstraction Layer (AAL) defined in AALGAP [29].

The Near-RT RIC O-RAN NF in figure below provides RAN analytics information services via the Y1 service interface as specified in Y1GAP [39]. These services can be consumed by Y1 consumers after mutual authentication and authorization by subscribing to or requesting the RAN analytics information via the Y1 service interface. Y1 consumers role can be played by entities which are within an PLMN trusted domain. Y1 consumers outside the PLMN trusted domain may use Y1 services in a secure manner via an exposure function, e.g., as in 3GPP TS 23.501 [1], clause 5.20. The framework for mutual authentication and authorization between Y1 consumers and the Near-RT RIC is not supported in the present document.

Figure 5.11: High Level Architecture of O-RAN

Within the logical architecture of O-RAN, as shown in Figure 5.12 below, the radio side includes Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU O-RAN NFs. The E2 interface connects O-eNB to Near-RT RIC.  Although not shown in this figure, the O-eNB does support O-DU and O-RU O-RAN NFs with an Open Fronthaul interface between them. The Near-RT RIC, in the figure below, supports the Y1 service interface towards Y1 consumers. Y1 consumers, unlike the other network elements shown in this figure, does not denote a logical O-RAN function.

As stated earlier, the management side includes SMO Framework containing a Non-RT-RIC function. The O-Cloud, on the other hand, is a cloud computing platform comprising a collection of physical infrastructure nodes that meet O-RAN requirements to host the relevant O-RAN NFs (such as Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU etc.), the supporting software components (such as Operating System, Virtual Machine Monitor, Container Runtime, etc.) and the appropriate management and orchestration functions. The virtualization of O-RU is not supported in the present document.

As shown in this figure, the O-RU provides the Open Fronthaul M-Plane interface to authorized O-DU in hierarchical mode, or to authorized O-DU and SMO in hybrid mode as specified in Open FH M-Plane [24] and OAM Architecture [34].

NOTE: The LLS (O-DU to O-RU interface) specified in clauses 5.3.5 and 5.3.6 (Split Option 7-2x) is the Open Fronthaul interface described in the Open FH CUS-Plane [19]. Other LLS options specified in 3GPP TR 38.801 [i.2] may be considered for reference designs when the relevant interfaces are described in specifications created by related open industry initiatives (e.g., the Small Cell Forum for Split Option 6) or in O-RAN white-box hardware specifications (e.g., Split Option 8).

As shown in Figure 5.12, O-DU provides D2 interface to connect with peer O-DU for supporting inter O-DU carrier aggregation. The D2 interface includes D2-u and D2-c services.

Figure 5.12: Logical Architecture of O-RAN

The following figure shows the Uu interface between UE and O-RAN NFs as well as between UE and O-eNB. As shown in Figure 5.13 below, the dotted box denotes all the O-RAN NFs required to support the Uu interface for NR. The O-eNB, on the other hand, terminates the Uu interface for LTE. Please refer to clause 5.4.17 for more details.

Figure 5.13: Uu interface for O-RAN Network Functions and O-eNB

5.2	O-RAN control loops

The O-RAN architecture supports at least the following control loops involving different O-RAN functionalities:

Non-RT (Non-Real Time) control loops

Near-RT (Near-Real Time) control loops

RT (Real Time) control loops

Figure 5.21: O-RAN Control Loops

As shown in Figure 5.21 above, the control loops are defined based on the controlling entity and the architecture shows the other logical entities with which the control loop host interacts.

Control loops exist at various levels and run simultaneously. Depending on the use case, they may or may not interact with each other. The use cases for the Non-RT and Near-RT control loops and the interaction between the RICs for these use cases are fully defined by O-RAN Use Cases Detailed Specification [38]. The Use Cases Detailed Specification [38] also defines relevant interaction for the O-CU-CP and O-DU control loops, responsible for call control and mobility, radio scheduling, HARQ, beamforming etc. along with slower mechanisms involving SMO management interfaces.
The timing of these control loops is use case dependent. Typical execution time for use cases involving the Non-RT control loops are 1 second or more; Near-RT control loops are in the order of 10 milliseconds or more; control loops in the E2 Nodes can operate below 10 milliseconds. (e.g., O-DU radio scheduling).

For any specific use case, however, a stable solution would require the loop time in the Non-RT RIC and/or SMO management plane processes to be significantly longer than the loop time for the same use case in the control entities stated above.

5.3	Description of O-RAN architecture elements

5.3.1	Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)

5.3.1.1	SMO architecture principles

Service Based Architecture (SBA) introduces the roles of service producer and service consumer together with standardized service-based interfaces. These standardized service-based interfaces enable interoperability within the SMO. SBA is not concerned with the implementation, but it defines logical functions in their service producer and consumer roles. When properly applied the SBA approach can enable the following:

Validates produced services with consumer use cases.

Identifies service operations with their information model defining semantic behaviour.

Specifies the API and a data model for a syntactic interface.

Identifies common services that can be produced by a single producer such as those that are commonly used by multiple internal consumers (e.g., authentication, authorization, service registration and discovery, data management, etc.).

5.3.1.2	SMO Services (SMOSs)

5.3.1.2.1	Introduction to SMO Services

In the O-RAN architecture, SMO is responsible for RAN domain management. The SMO description in this architecture document is focused on the SMO services that support the RAN. Following the SBA principles above, the SMO Services produced by the SMO are defined. A SMOF implementation can produce and/or consume any combinations of one or more SMOSs, provided that the SMOF complies with the O-RAN specifications of the interfaces exposing the SMOSs.

The Non-RT RIC SMOF example depicted in the Figure 5.31 below shows support for rApps and for A1 related SMOSs. Otherwise, the definition of SMOFs is in general not in scope of the O-RAN specifications, as the interoperable functional behaviour of SMOFs is specified via the SMOS Producer/Consumer roles.

The SMO Services produced by the SMO are:

RAN NF OAM SMO Service specified in 3GPP TS 32.101 [3], including capabilities such as,

RAN NF Performance Assurance Management (NFPM)

RAN NF Fault Supervision Management (NFFM)

RAN NF Provisioning Management (NFCM)

Others, e.g., Tracing, Logging, etc.

Network Functions Orchestration (NFO) SMOS

Federated O-Cloud Orchestration and Management (FOCOM) SMOS

Service Management and Exposure (SME) SMOS

Data Management and Exposure (DME) SMOS

SME SMOS supports the exposure of other SMOSs, to both internal and external SMOS consumers.

DME SMOS supports the exposure of data produced by SMOS Producers, to both internal and external SMOS consumers.

The SMOSs described in this document are represented in a service-based architecture in the Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1 below.

Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1: SMOSs in the SMO SBA representation

The SMOS Communication, shown in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1, represents the logical support for communication between any SMOS Producer, SMOS Consumer, and rApps. Examples of SMOS Communication implementation include, but are not limited to, service mesh, API gateway, direct communication, and message bus. SMOS consumers and producers rely on the capabilities provided by SME for purposes such as service discovery and on the capabilities provided by DME for purposes such as data exposure.

5.3.1.2.2	SMO in the O-RAN architecture

All the SMO Service producers represented in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1 can also be SMOS consumers.

The SMO consumes services offered by other O-RAN architecture elements through four key southbound interfaces:

A1 Interface between the Non-RT RIC in the SMO and the Near-RT RIC for RAN Optimization.

O1 Interface provides SMO FCAPS support either directly or indirectly between the SMO and the O-RAN Network Functions.

In the hierarchical model, SMO FCAPS support information over O1 to the O-DU which uses the Open FH M-Plane interface to manage the O-RU.

In the hybrid model, SMO provides FCAPS support information over Open FH M-Plane interface between the SMO and the O-RU and over O1 to the O-DU which uses the Open FH M-Plane interface to manage the O-RU.

O2 Interface between the SMO and the O-Cloud to provide O-Cloud resource management and workload management.

5.3.1.2.3	Non-RT RIC

Non-RT RIC is the functionality internal to the SMO that supports intelligent RAN optimization by:

enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide policy-based guidance over the A1 interface

enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide enrichment information over the A1 interface

enabling an A1-related SMOS to provide ML model management over the A1 interface

enabling RAN optimization actions through RAN NF OAM SMOS over O1 and Open FH M-Plane interfaces, and NFO and FOCOM SMOSs over O2 interface

The rApps can be producers and/or consumers of R1 services, as shown in Figure 5.3.1.2.1-1. For more information on R1 services and the R1 interface refer to Non-RT RIC Architecture [27].

Non-RT RIC supports intelligent RAN optimization control loops through rApps with intervals greater than 1 second.

5.3.1.2.4	SMO capabilities extensions

As a flexible extension mechanism, the SMO allows delivery of aspects of RAN management and orchestration functionality via rApps.

5.3.1.2.5	External exposure of SMO capabilities and data

The exposure of SMO capabilities and data to external SMO consumers is done via SME and DME respectively, as represented in an SBA approach depicted in Figure 5.3.1.2.51.

Figure 5.3.1.2.51: SMO external terminations

5.3.2	Near-RT RIC

Near-RT RIC is an O-RAN NF that enables near real-time control and optimization of services and resources of E2 Nodes via fine-grained data collection and actions over the E2 interface with control loops in the order of 10 ms-1s. The Near-RT RIC hosts one or more xApps that use E2 interface to collect near real-time information (e.g., on a UE basis or a Cell basis) and provide value added services. The Near-RT RIC control over the E2 Nodes is steered via the policies and the enrichment data provided via A1 from the Non-RT RIC. Based on the available data, the Near-RT RIC generates the RAN analytics information and exposes it via Y1 interface.

The functional enhancement provided by the Near-RT RIC and the E2 Node is subject to the capability of the E2 Node exposed over the E2 interface by means of the E2SM [25], in order to support the use cases described in Use Cases Detailed Specification [38]. The E2 service model describes the functions in the E2 Node which may be controlled by the Near-RT RIC and the related procedures. For a function exposed in the E2SM [25], the Near-RT RIC may e.g., monitor, override, or control via policies the behavior of E2 Node.

In the event of a Near-RT RIC failure, the E2 Node shall be able to provide services but there may be an impact to certain optimization capabilities that are provided by the Near-RT RIC.

The Near-RT RIC is composed of a Near-RT RIC platform and one or more xApps as specified in Near-RT RIC Architecture [26] and their capabilities are exposed as services. Both the Near-RT RIC platform and an xApp can be a service producer and/or a service consumer, and these services can be accessed via the set of Near-RT RIC APIs as illustrated in Figure 5.3.21.

5.5	UE associated identifiers used in O-RAN

As described earlier (clauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2), the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC enable intelligent RAN optimization via A1, O1 and E2 interfaces respectively.

To support intelligent RAN optimization, the Non-RT RIC with rApps and Near-RT RIC with xApps utilize the knowledge of different UE associated events reported by the O-RAN NFs (excluding O-RU) over E2 and O1 interfaces. Both the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC may need to correlate different UE associated events reported by the O-RAN functions for the same UE. In order to facilitate this correlation task, the reporting O-RAN NF includes a set of UE associated identifiers with any report containing UE specific information.

The Table 5.51 below shows the set of UE associated identifiers to be reported by any O-RAN NF (excluding O-RU) over O1 and E2 interfaces for any UE associated information.

5.6	O-RAN security architecture

The goals of the O-RAN ALLIANCE are to achieve a secure, open, and interoperable RAN. Building upon security advancements from the 3GPP and IETF standards development organizations, the O-RAN ALLIANCE specifies an O-RAN security architecture with the goal to enable 5G CSPs (Communication Service Provider) to deploy and operate O-RAN with the same, or higher level of confidence as a 3GPP-specified RAN. The O-RAN ALLIANCE is strengthening O-RAN’s security posture by specifying security requirements and security controls that mitigate risk across its attack surface while pursuing the goals of a ZTA (Zero-Trust Architecture).

The O-RAN security architecture is specified in the following two O-RAN Technical Specifications:

Security Protocols Specifications [36]

Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [37]

The above TSs, Security Protocols Specifications [36] and Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [37], include specifications for configuration and cipher suites with use of the following security protocols on O-RAN interfaces to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity: SSHv2 (Secure Shell 2.0), TLS 1.2 and 1.3, DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) 1.2, IPsec (Internet Protocol Security), OAuth 2.0, CMPv2, IEEE 802.1X, and NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) over Secure Transport.

O-RAN has also provided requirements for SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) in Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [37].

The test cases to verify proper security implementation of O-RAN security architecture is specified in the O-RAN Technical Specification:

O-RAN Security Tests Specifications [32]

The threats to the O-RAN architecture and the risk assessment are documented in the TR:

O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment [i.4]

The security threat modeling and risk analysis is used to derive the security requirements and security controls in the Security Requirements and Controls Specifications [37]. The O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment [i.4] considers external and internal threats to achieve a ZTA.  In addition, security analysis TRs are maintained for O-RAN NFs and features.  These TRs help to drive the requirements in the O-RAN security specifications.

NOTE: Internal and external threats are considered in a ZTA, as defined in NIST SP 800-207 [i.6].  Achieving a ZTA is an incremental process, as identified by the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in Zero Trust Maturity Model [i.7].  The O-RAN ALLIANCE is continuing to pursue a ZTA as the O-RAN architecture, threats, and controls evolve.

6	O-RAN Information Model (IM) principles

O-RAN shall align its Information Model (IM) with 3GPP to the extent possible. The additional O-RAN extensions to its IM and DMs (Data Model) are described in O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification [30].

Annex (informative): Implementation options of O-RAN functions and nework elements

A.1	Shared cell

Shared cell, as specified in Open FH CUS-Plane [19], is defined as the operation for the same cell by several O-RUs with one or multiple component carriers. It can be deployed in either FHM (Fronthaul Multiplexer) or Cascade mode as described below.

In FHM mode, the shared cell may be realized by placing an FHM function between an O-DU and several O-RUs that may have one or multiple component carriers from these O-RUs. FHM function may be modelled as an O-RU with LLS Fronthaul support (same as normal O-RU) along with the copy and combine function (additional to normal O-RU), but without radio transmission/reception capability. The Figure A.1-1 below shows how each O-RU can be used for either operating in the same cell (Single Cell Scenario) or in different cells (Multiple Cells Scenario) by configuring the FHM function.

Figure A.1-1: Shared cell deployment using FHM mode

In Cascade mode, the shared cell is realized by several O-RUs cascaded in chain. In this case, one or more O-RUs are inserted between the O-DU and the O-RU. The O-RUs in the cascaded chain except for the last O-RU support Copy and Combine function. Figure A.1-2 below shows an implementation of Cascade mode shared cell.

Figure A.1-2: Shared cell deployment using Cascade mode

The Cascade mode, as described above, is implemented within the O-RU.

Please refer to Open FH CUS-Plane [19] for additional information.

A.2	FHGW function

The FHGW (Fronthaul Gateway) function may be placed between the O-DU and RU/RRU (Radio Unit / Remote Radio Unit) with the following O-RAN specified interfaces:

The interface between O-DU and FHGW function is Open Fronthaul (Option 7-2x).

The interface between FHGW function and RU/RRU is subject to reference implementation developed by any relevant O-RAN WG (e.g., WG7) as described in Hardware Reference Design Specification for Indoor Picocell FR1 with Split Architecture Option 8 [23].

The interface between FHGW function and RU/RRU does not support Open Fronthaul (Option 7-2x).

The FHGW function may be packaged with other functions (such as Ethernet switching) in a physical product, as considered within WG7.

The Figure A.2-1 below depicts the deployment of the FHGW function using O-RAN specified interfaces.

Figure A.2-1: Deployment of O-DU and RU/RRU using FHGW function

A.3	Near-RT RIC

The Near-RT RIC can control multiple E2 Nodes or can control a single E2 Node. The following figures show two implementation options of Near-RT RIC.

A.4	Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU

Although the O-RAN architecture specifies the O-RAN NFs Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU and O-RU as separate O-RAN architecture elements, it is possible in the implementation to aggreagate some or all of these O-RAN NFs, and thus collapsing some of the internal interfaces, e.g., F1-c, F1-u, E1, and E2. At least the following implementation options are possible:

Disaggregated O-RAN NFs as per O-RAN architecture

Aggregate O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP

Aggregate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, and O-DU

Aggregate Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, and O-CU-UP

Aggregate O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU

Aggregate O-DU and O-RU

Aggregate Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU, and O-RU

Aggregation of O-RAN NFs is supported by the O-RAN specified interfaces O1 and E2. For the O1 interface, the aggregated O-RAN NFs will be managed as separate Managed Functions belonging to a single Managed Element as specified in OAM Architecture [34]. For the E2 interface the aggregated O-RAN NFs can be exposed as part of the E2 Service Model towards the Near-RT RIC (see Annex A in E2GAP [22]).

Please see the figures (i.e., Figure A.4-1 through Figure A.4-7) below.

A.5	Cooperative transport

To enhance the resource utilization and reduce the latency of UL LLS traffic when using a shared point-to-multipoint transport network requiring resource allocation (such as PON or DOCSIS), the O-RAN architecture supports a cooperative transport feature. The cooperative transport feature is based on the O-DU’s knowledge of the expected uplink LLS traffic from a given O-RU which is provided to the associated (PON or DOCSIS) TN in the transport network. This enables the TN to dynamically allocate the correct bandwidth over the shared transport network to the TU that is used by the O-RU. The CTI signaling is described in CTI Control [20]. To support the CTI, the O-DU is configured over the O1 interface with CTI client specific configuration as described in CTI Management [21]. When there are intermediate nodes between the O-DU and the TN, they will forward the CTI messages transparently but will not participate in CTI interactions.

A simplified architecture of the CTI is shown in figure A.5-1 below. The SMO, O-DU and O1 interface shown in this figure are part of the O-RAN Architecture (please see clauses 5.3.1, 5.3.5, and 5.4.3, respectively), whereas the TN and Transport OAM, are the components of the transport network. For detailed specification and reference architecture, please see CTI Control [20] and CTI Management [21].

A.6	Inter O-DU Carrier Aggregation (CA)

The D2 interface is used for supporting carrier aggregation across cells configured in the different O-DUs as specified in D2GAP [40]. In the present document, DL CA is supported by the D2 interface that includes D2-c and D2-u.
