Foreword

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by O-RAN Alliance Working Group 2. It is part of a TS-family covering the A1 interface as identified below:

"A1 interface: General Aspects and Principles";

"A1 interface: Use Cases and Requirements";

"A1 interface: Transport Protocol";

"A1 interface: Application Protocol";

"A1 interface: Type Definitions"; and

"A1 interface: Test Specification".

The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows:

version xx.yy.zz

where:

xx:	the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

yy:	the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

zz:	the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.

6	Use cases for A1 policy management

6.1	Policy type discovery use cases

6.1.1	Background and goal of the use cases

The policy type discovery use cases define how Non-RT RIC can detect which A1 policy types are available in a Near-RT RIC and how Non-RT RIC can retrieve information about one or more A1 policy types.

Policy type information is provided by the Near-RT RIC and is used by Non-RT RIC for creating and by Near-RT RIC for validating A1 policies. When policy type identifier and policy type information are known, the Non-RT RIC can create A1 policies in a Near-RT RIC as described by policy creation use cases.

6.1.2	Entities/resources involved in the use cases

1)	Non-RT RIC:

a)	Discovers A1 policy types available in Near-RT RIC.

2)	Near-RT RIC:

b)	Makes A1 policy types available to Non-RT RIC for which it can support A1 policies.

Annex A (normative):
Authorization of service access requests

A.1	Pre-conditions

The preconditions of the A1 use cases in clauses 6 to 8 are that the actors are authorized for using the A1 service and the authorization procedures are defined in SPS [9], clause 4.7. The registration process for the entity acting as service producer is described in SPS [9], clause 4.7.2.2, and the access token request process for the entity acting as service consumer is described in SPS [9], clause 4.7.2.3.

A.2	A1 service access based on token verification use cases

A.2.1	Background and goal of the use cases

The service access request based on token verification is described generically in SPS [9], clause 4.7.2.4.

The A1 service access use cases define how the access token is transferred and verified. This description applies to all solutions specified in clauses 6 to 8 although they do not explicitly refer to token transfer or verification.

A.2.2	Entities/resources involved in the use cases

1)	SMO/Non-RT RIC framework:

a)	either makes service access requests containing access token; or

b)	verifies received access token before sending service access responses.

2)	Near-RT RIC:

a)	either verifies received access token before sending service access responses; or

b)	makes service access requests containing access token.

A.2.3	Solutions

A.2.3.1	General

The notation A1 Consumer refers to either A1-P Consumer, A1-EI Consumer, or A1-ML Consumer while the notation A1 Producer refers to either A1-P Producer, A1-EI Producer, or A1-ML Producer. SMO/Non-RT RIC framework acts as A1 Consumer for A1-P and/or A1-ML when Near-RT RIC acts as A1 Producer for A1-P and/or A1-ML, and SMO/Non-RT RIC framework acts as A1 Producer for A1-EI and/or A1-ML when Near-RT RIC acts as A1 Consumer for A1-EI and/or A1-ML.

The notation “service access” for the use case, the procedure, and the request/response messages in this clause refers to the use case, procedure and request/response message names used in the solutions in clauses 6 to 8.

A1 Producer verifies the access token.

Step 3 (M)

A1 Producer sends A1 service access response message.

Exceptions

If token verification was not successful, further details may be provided that may indicate what is needed to access the service.

In addition to the data required in the solutions in clauses 6 to 8, the access token is included in the service access request message.

In case service access is rejected due to that access is forbidden, the service access response message may include information on the token scope necessary to access the service.
