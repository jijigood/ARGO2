For the purposes of the present document, the following terms apply:
API consumer: The Service Consumer consuming one or more services using APIs.
NOTE: The Service Consumer role is introduced in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5].
API producer: The Service Producer that offers its services for consumption via APIs.
NOTE: The Service Producer role is introduced in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5].
3.2	Symbols
Void
3.3	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the follow abbreviations apply:
API 		Application programming interface
FQDN				Fully qualified domain name
4	Application protocol for the R1 services
4.1	Introduction
The present document contains a realization for the procedures identified in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5]. It is based on transport protocols as defined in R1TP [7]. This definition of the R1 Application Protocols (R1AP) defined in the present document is based on the 3GPP service framework for network functions specified in 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] .
4.2	Version conventions for the present document
The version number of the present document follows the "xx.yy" versioning scheme. There could be implications for the interoperability between rApps and R1 service API implementations in SMO/Non-RT RIC framework that are based on different versions of the present document.
An incremented "xx" version field of the present document could indicate that a new major feature (e.g., a new R1 service) has been added or that an incompatible change has been made to one or more R1 service APIs. An incremented "yy" version field could indicate that an optional feature has been added, a technical issue has been fixed, or that clarifications or editorial corrections have been made.
The version conventions for RESTful R1 service APIs are defined in clause 5.2.
5	RESTful R1 service APIs
5.1	Overview
The design of the RESTful R1 service APIs is based on the procedures and requirements defined in O-RAN TS R1UCR [6] and O-RAN TS R1GAP [5], and on the protocol design framework as specified in 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] .
The API version of a service API includes a pre-release version (e.g. "-alpha.1") if the service API is under development.
The present document defines the protocols for the R1 service APIs listed in table 5.1-1.
Table 5.1-1: RESTful R1 service APIs and their versions defined in the present document
5.2	Versioning of RESTful R1 service APIs
Each RESTful R1 service API is versioned independently. The API version number defined in the present document contains three numerical fields following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern, and may contain a pre-release version field, according to SemVer [11].
The API version number held by an implementation may additionally include a build metadata field, according to SemVer [11], to indicates a specific deployment. The content of this field is implementation specific; its is provided by the deployment. The <apiVersion> path segment used in URI structures indicate the MAJOR field of the API version number. The full API version number is visible in the "version" field of the "info" object of each OpenAPI document in Annex A.
To indicate the full API version the API consumer intends to use, the API consumer may include the "Version" HTTP header (see IETF RFC 4229[13] ) in an HTTP request, in which case the header shall contain the version identifier as defined above. It is optional to include the build metadata field.
The API producer shall include in the response the "Version" HTTP header signalling the used API version, including the build metadata if available. If the build metadata have been omitted in the request, the API producer shall use the combination of MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH and pre-release indicator as requested and the highest supported value for the build metadata field for that combination, if available. In case the API consumer has not sent a "Version" header in the request, the API producer shall use the latest available version, and signal it in the "Version" header.
NOTE:	In case multiple versions are supported by an API producer under the URI for a major version, this allows the API consumer to request a particular version. This mechanism is referred to as "microversioning".
If the API version signalled by the API consumer in the "Version" request header is not supported by the API producer, the API producer shall respond with a "406 Not Acceptable" error and may include in the response payload body a Problem Details structure providing more information on the cause of the error.
5.3	URI structure and supported content formats
This clause specifies the URI prefix and the supported content formats applicable to the RESTful R1 service APIs.
All resource URIs of the APIs shall have the following prefix:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API service consumer towards the API service producer shall have the resource URI structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] , i.e.:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>
with the following components:
-	The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] ; however,  the restrictions w.r.t the operator specific FQDN of the host portion defined there do not apply.
-	The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. It is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding RESTful R1 service API.
-	The <apiVersion> indicates the major version (see clause 5.1A)  of the API and is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding RESTful R1 serviceAPI.
-	Each <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> represents a specific resource of the API. It is defined in the corresponding RESTful R1 service API for each one of the defined resources.
For HTTP requests and responses that have message content, the content format JSON (see IETF RFC 8259 [12]) shall be supported. The JSON format shall be signalled by the content type "application/json".
All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [8]. An implementation that dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of path segments that are separated by "/", query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the character set that is allowed by IETFRFC 3986 [8] for these parts.
5.4	General considerations for RESTful R1 service APIs
5.4.1	Usage of HTTP header fields
HTTP headers are components of the headers section of the HTTP request and response messages. The usage of HTTP header fields shall follow the definitions in clause 4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
5.4.2	Handling of large query results
The handling of large query results shall be supported by RESTful R1 service APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
5.4.3	Error reporting
In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is generally not enough to discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error information is typically delivered.
The RESTful R1 service APIs shall support the error reporting as specified in clause 6 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "RESTful R1 service API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
If an HTTP method is not defined for a particular resource in the present document, that method is not supported. When that method is requested on the resource, the API producer shall return a "405 Method
Not Allowed" response as defined in clause 6.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].
6	Service management and exposure services
6.1	Service registration API
6.1.1	Usage of HTTP header fields
This API allows the API producer to manage service registrations based on the procedures for “Registration of services” defined in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5].
6.1.2	API version
For the service registration API as specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be 1, the MINOR version field shall be 0 and the PATCH version field shall be 0 (see clause 4.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1]  for a definition of the version fields). Consequently, the <apiVersion> URI variable shall be set to "v1".
The service registration API is under development and consequently the API version shall include the pre-release version "alpha.1".
6.1.3	Resource structure and methods
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API consumer towards the API producer shall have the resource URI structure as defined for the CAPIF_Publish_Service_API (see Figure 8.2.2.1-1 in Clause 8.2.2 in 3GPP TS 29.222[14]).
Table 6.1.3-1 lists the individual resources defined for the API, the applicable HTTP methods as defined in clause 8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.222 [9]) and the associated service operations.
