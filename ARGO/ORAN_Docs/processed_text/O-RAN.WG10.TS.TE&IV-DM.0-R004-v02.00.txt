O-RAN.WG10.TS.TE&IV-DM.0-R004-v02.00 
Foreword 
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WGn of the O-RAN Alliance. 
The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN 
approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an 
identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows: 
version xx.yy.zz 
where: 
xx: the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. 
(the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed. 
yy: the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.  Always 2 
digits with leading zero if needed. 
zz: the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the 
editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed. 
Modal verbs terminology 
In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and 
"cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of 
provisions). 
"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation. 
Executive summary 
The present document specifies the TE&IV Data Models suited to realize the TE&IV Information Models as specified in [1].

1. Scope 
This document specifies the TE&IV Data Models used to support TE&IV services within the SMO. 
2. References 
2.1. Normative references 
References are either specific (identified by date of publication and/or edition number or version number) or non -specific. For 
specific references, only the cited version applies. For non-specific references, the latest version of the referenced document 
(including any amendments) applies. In the case of a reference to a 3GPP document, a non-specific reference implicitly refers 
to the latest version of that document in Release 18. 
NOTE: While any hyperlinks included in this clause were valid at the time of publication, O -RAN cannot guarantee their 
long term validity. 
The following referenced documents are necessary for the application of the present document.

Stage 2" (“TE&IV CIMI”)

4. Solution Set (SS) definitions 
4.1 YANG based Solution Set (SS) definitions 
The present document defines the following TE&IV Solution Set definitions for O-RAN: 
- YANG based ORAN TEIV Common YANG Types and Extensions Solution Set (Annex A). 
- YANG based ORAN TE&IV RAN Domain Solution Set (Annex B). 
- YANG based ORAN TE&IV Physical Domain Solution Set (Annex C). 
- YANG based ORAN TE&IV REL-Physical-RAN Domain Solution Set (Annex D). 
4.1.1 TE&IV Mapping from YANG to JSON schema 
4.1.1.1  Introduction 
As specified in Clause 5.3 of the TE&IV API Specification [2], responses with message content shall be in JSON format.  
This clause defines the JSON mappings for the YANG schema specified in clause 4.1. Building on the principles outlined in 
RFC 7951 [3], the mappings specified here are extended to accommodate the YANG extensions in the O-RAN TE&IV YANG 
based Solution Set.  
4.1.1.2  The “biDirectionalTopologyRelationship” Data Node 
The biDirectionalTopologyRelationship data node describes a bi-directional relationship in the TE&IV model. It is a 
relationship comprising of an aSide and a bSide.  
aSide and bSide are YANG extensions representing each end of the relationship. The order of aSide and bSide is important and 
must not be changed once defined. See TE&IV Common Information Models and Interface [1] Clause 4.2.1.1.4.1. Both aSide 
and bSide take a Topology Entity type as an argument. This entity type is represented by an instance identifier.  
A biDirectionalTopologyRelationship instance is encoded as an object containing an array of nested objects, where each nested 
object represents child data nodes as its properties, as shown below. 
A YANG example for the biDirectionalTopologyRelationship definition would be  
       or-teiv-yext:biDirectionalTopologyRelationship NFDEPLOYMENT_SERVES_ODUFUNCTION { 
 
        … 
        key id; 
 
        leaf-list served-oduFunction { 
            description "O-DU Function served by this NF Deployment."; 
            or-teiv-yext:aSide or-teiv-cloud:NFDeployment; 
            type instance-identifier; 
        } 
 
        leaf-list serving-nFDeployment { 
            description "NF Deployment that serves this O-DU Function."; 
            or-teiv-yext:bSide or-teiv-ran:ODUFunction; 
            type instance-identifier; 
        } 
    } 
 
the following is an example of a valid JSON-encoded instance: 
{ 
    "o-ran-smo-teiv-rel-ran-cloud: NFDEPLOYMENT_SERVES_ODUFUNCTION": [ 
        { 
            "id": "urn:<instance identifier of NFDeployment_serves_ODUFunction>",
