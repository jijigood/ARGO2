NOTE:	The messages have been defined in accordance with the guidelines specified in 3GPP TR 25.921 [i.2].

6.2	Information Element definitions

6.2.1	General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);

-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

6.3.1	General

E2SM ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [16] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [17].

Clause 6.3.2 presents the Abstract Syntax of the common E2SM information elements that may be used with RAN Function specific O-RAN WG3.E2AP [3] Information Elements when encoded using ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this clause and the tabular format in clause 6.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
