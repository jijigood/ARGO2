Philosophy
It is expected that O-RAN Managed Elements, specified in O-RAN Operations and Maintenance Architecture [32], comply with the O1 Interface Specification, except the O-RU which complies with the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
The O-RAN O1 management services follow existing 3GPP standards wherever possible.  The focus of this document is to identify the use cases which conform to existing 3GPP standards, identify gaps in management services for O-RAN and define needed extensions.  For identified gaps, the goal is to modify the 3GPP standards to include the needed O-RAN extensions and update the references in this document as the 3GPP standards evolve to cover the gaps. In cases where the 3GPP standards are not modified, O-RAN extensions are specified in this, and other, O-RAN documents. O-RAN extensions should be compatible with 3GPP standards as much as possible to avoid divergence. If extensions and gaps are not specified, it is expected that the management services providers and consumers are conforming to referenced 3GPP specifications.
This O1 Interface Specification specifies the management services (MnS) supported in the O-RAN architecture between O1 compliant Managed Elements (MnS providers) and the SMO (MnS consumer).  It defines common MnS descriptions, requirements, procedures, operations, and notifications. In addition, there are complementary O1 Interface Specifications for the Near-RT RIC [28], the O-CU-UP and O-CU-CP [30] and the O-DU [31] that define the O1 specificities, extensions, and restrictions for that particular managed function (MF).
For example,
O1 Interface Specification for a MF may contain the alarms and performance measurements generated by that MF,
O1 Interface Specification for O-DU may include extensions needed by O-DU for managing O-RU in hierarchical mode,
O1 Interface Specification for Near-RT RIC may document the O1 MnS services that it does not provide and may reference a related specification containing procedures and APIs for managing xApps.
Open Points
As each Management Service is evaluated, the Use Cases and relevant specifications need to be assessed and augmented as needed to support O-RAN. The current list of Use Cases in Chapter 2 below is not exhaustive, and the list of specification references may not be complete.
Some Use Cases referred to in the standard may not be applicable to O-RAN and this needs to be addressed, as an exception.
Future clarifications may be added to specify when citing a reference whether it is being used as a citation (meaning it will be strictly followed) or as a reference.  More precise terminology may be included as this draft matures.
O-RAN Security Focus Group (SFG) plans to develop an O-RAN security architecture, as well as security guidelines and requirements for all O-RAN Working Groups (WG) and O-RAN entities.  The security architecture, guidelines and requirements will be incorporated into existing O-RAN documents, as appropriate. The O1 Interface Specification intends to comply with the security architecture, guidelines and requirements that are applicable to the O1 interface and will provide appropriate references, when available.
It is mandatory for the O-RU to comply with the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29] for management services.  There is a joint WG1/WG4 Work Item (WI) in progress to determine how the O-RU can support management services in the O1 Interface Specification, in what time frame, and under what conditions.  Future versions of the O1 Interface Specification will be updated as necessary to reflect the decisions of this WI.
As specified in Section 1.6.6 below, it is agreed that a PNF MnS provider must be able to inform a PNF MnS consumer that a reset has occurred and the reason for the reset.  However, it is still FFS how the MnS consumer is informed.  Some options to consider are a dedicated PNF Reset notification, the PNF Registration notification (for full PNF reset), CM notifications that report changes in the operational state (for reset of a HW subcomponent) or simply a log file containing reset information.  Other options may be proposed when this topic is discussed.
It is FFS how a MnS consumer should subscribe to notifications that are specified by O-RAN, and not 3GPP.
General Requirements
This section contains general requirements that are applicable to many O1 Interface Management Services.
Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)
REQ-SMO-FUN-1:  O-RAN compliant SMOs SHALL support the O1 interfaces as defined in this document.
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
TLS requirements are specified in O-RAN Security Protocol Specifications [34] section 2.2 and 2.3.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
REQ-HTP-FUN-1:  Management Service providers and consumers that use HTTP SHALL support HTTP v1.1 or higher.  HTTP v2.0 is preferred.
Secure Shell (SSH)
SSH requirements are specified in O-RAN Security Protocol Specifications [34] section 2.1.
Least Privilege Access Control
Least privilege access control requirements for the O1 interface are specified in O-RAN Security Requirements Specification [35] section 3.2.2.
Void
O1 Notifications
An O1 notification is a JSON encoded asynchronous notification sent from a MnS provider to a MnS consumer over the O1 interface using REST/HTTPS.
An O1 notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
VES O1 format
An SDO O1 format notification is an O1 notification formatted as specified by a Standards Defining Organization (SDO). Currently, O1 supports SDO O1 format notifications that are either 3GPP-specified or O-RAN-specified. SDO O1 format notifications are formatted as specified by the SDO and sent without a VES header.
3GPP-specified O1 notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4], clause 11 and clause 12.
O-RAN-specified O1 notifications will be specified in the O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification [33].
O-RAN-specified O1 notifications should follow 3GPP naming and format where possible to reduce the number of variants that need to be supported.  Specifically, O-RAN-specified O1 notifications should:
be named “o1NotifyXxx”
include the common 3GPP notification fields objectClass, objectInstance, notificationId, notificationType, eventTime and systemDN
include an additionalText and/or additionalInformation field when appropriate.
A VES O1 format notification is an O1 notification formatted as specified by VES Event Listener Specification [36], consisting of a common event header and domain-specific event fields. VES O1 format notifications are categorized into 2 types, based on domain:
Harmonized VES
Legacy VES
Harmonized VES refers to the stndDefined VES event specified in VES Event Listener Specification [36] that allows a VES event to carry, as its payload, a notification specified by an SDO.  In the case of O-RAN O1 Interface Specification, a harmonized stndDefined VES event carries either a 3GPP-specified O1 notification or an O-RAN specified O1 notification as its payload.
Legacy VES refers to any VES event specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], except for stndDefined.  Legacy VES events are fully defined in [36] and don’t rely on an SDO to specify the content of the payload.  The Legacy VES events supported by O1 Interface Specification is PNF Registration.
Legacy VES events are supported for backward compatibility.  However, harmonized VES events are preferred.  Use of harmonized VES events results in less notification variants for the providers and the consumers because a harmonized VES O1 format notification is effectively an SDO O1 format notification wrapped in a VES common event header.
Two attributes are used to communicate the notification format between MnS provider and MnS consumer.
o1NotifyFormatCapabilities indicates whether the MnS provider supports the capability to send notifications in SDO O1 format, VES O1 format or both.  This attribute is set by the MnS provider at the Managed Element level, meaning the capability is for all O1 notifications sent by that MnS provider.  It is not per notification type. This attribute is read-only for the MnS consumer.
o1NotifyFormatConfig indicates whether the MnS consumer wants to receive notifications in SDO O1 format or VES O1 format. This attribute is optional to be supported by MnS provider. This attribute is configured by the MnS consumer at the Managed Element level, meaning the configuration is for all O1 notifications sent by that MnS provider.  It is not per notification type.  If the MnS provider supports both formats, the MnS provider sets the value for this attribute to the default value of VES O1 format when the MOI is created and the MnS consumer is permitted to change the value to SDO O1 format if desired. Otherwise, if the MnS provider only supports one notification format, this attribute is absent.
These two attributes will be specified in the O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification [33].
It is not necessary to have an attribute to indicate whether harmonized VES or legacy VES is sent for VES format because the domain of the event is provided in the VES common event header and the schema of the event is provided by the Network Function at onboarding time.
Management Services
Provisioning Management Services
Provisioning management services allow a Provisioning MnS Consumer to configure attributes of managed objects on the Provisioning MnS Provider that modify the Provisioning MnS Provider’s capabilities in its role in end-to-end network services and allows a Provisioning MnS Provider to report configuration changes to the Provisioning MnS Consumer. NETCONF is used for the Provisioning Management Services to Create Managed Object Instance, Delete Managed Object Instance, Modify Managed Object Instance Attributes and Read Managed Object Instance Attributes. A REST/HTTPS event is used to notify the Provisioning MnS subscribed Consumers when a configuration change occurs.
Stage 1 Provisioning management services are specified in 3GPP TS 28.531 [3] section 6.3.
Stage 2 CM operations and notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] section 11.1.1.
Stage 3 Provisioning operations for YANG/NETCONF solution set are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] section 12.1.3.
Stage 3 CM notifications for RESTful HTTP-based solution set are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] section A.1.1.
IETF reference documents for NETCONF and YANG include RFC 6241, “Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)” [39] and RFC 7950, “The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language” [40].
General NETCONF Requirements
REQ-GNC-FUN-1:  The provisioning management service provider and consumer SHALL support the following NETCONF operations as specified in RFC 6241 [39]:
get
get-config
edit-config
lock
unlock
close-session
kill-session
Other operations are optional.
REQ-GNC-FUN-2:  The provisioning management service provider and consumer SHALL support the following NETCONF capabilities:
writable-running
rollback-on-error
validate
xpath
Other capabilities are optional.
REQ-GNC-FUN-3:  The provisioning management service provider and consumer SHALL support a running datastore for NETCONF.  Support for a candidate datastore is optional.
REQ-GNC-FUN-4:  The provisioning management service provider and consumer SHALL support YANG1.1, defined in RFC 7950 [40], including coexistence with YANG Version 1 as specified therein.
REQ-GNC-FUN-5:  The provisioning management service provider SHALL have the capability to establish a NETCONF session with its authorized consumer upon request from the consumer.
REQ-GNC-FUN-6:  The provisioning management service provider SHALL support an established NETCONF session until the authorized consumer terminates the session.  NOTE: The consumer may want to perform multiple provisioning management services operations during a single NETCONF Session.
REQ-GNC-FUN-7:  The provisioning management service provider SHALL have the capability to terminate a NETCONF session with its authorized consumer when requested to do so by the authorized consumer.
REQ-GNC-FUN-8: The provisioning management service provider SHALL have the capability to make provisioning operation results persistent over a reset.
REQ-GNC-FUN-9: The provisioning management service provider and consumer SHALL support NETCONF over SSH or NETCONF over TLS.
REQ-GNC-FUN-10: The provisioning management service provider SHALL support /netconf-state/schemas subtree and <get-schema> RPC defined in RFC 6022 [38] for all supported YANG modules.

Operations and Notifications
A Provisioning MnS notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
An O1supported 3GPP-specified CM notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains an O1supported 3GPP-specified CM notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
The O1-supported 3GPP-specified CM notifications are:
notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges
notifyMOICreation
notifyMOIDeletion
notifyMOIChanges
A single notifyMOIChanges notification can report one or more MOI creations, MOI deletions and MOI attribute value changes in one notification.  The notifyMOIChanges notification can be used instead of notifyMOICreation, notifyMOIDeletion and notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges notifications.  For this reason, notifyMOIChanges is recommended to support and notifyMOICreation, notifyMOIDeletion and notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges are optional to support.
The attribute name value pairs in the CM notifications are provided using YANG 1.1 encoded in JSON format as specified in RFC 7951 [41].
Subscription Control
Description
Subscription Control allows a MnS Consumer to subscribe to notifications emitted by a MnS Provider.
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Management Services Use Cases will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms.  For Subscription Control, the Subscribe and Unsubscribe operations are replaced with a NtfSubscriptionControl IOC as specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].  NtfSubscriptionControl IOC contains attributes that allow a MnS Consumer to set the recipient address for the notifications and identify the scope of notifications desired.  Optionally, the types of notifications desired, and notification filtering may also be provided.  If filtering of the notifications is supported, only those notificatons that match the specified value would be sent.  For example, notifyNewAlarm notifications can be filtered to send only those with severity set to major or critical.
Requirements
NtfSubscriptionControl IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.22 with attribute definitions in 4.4.1.
YANG models for NtfSubscriptionControl are specified in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15] section D.2.6a.
Procedures
NtfSubscriptionControl instances may be created and deleted by the system or pre-installed.  Optionally, the NtfSubscriptionControl MOIs can be created and deleted, and attributes modified using NETCONF/YANG by the management service consumer following the procedures described in this Provisioning MnS section.
Operations and Notifications
Subscription Control can be used to subscribe to alarm notifications specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] section 4.4.1 notificationTypes.  Subscription Control can be used to subscribe to heartbeat notifications as specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] Figure 4.2.1-5; i.e., by creating the HeartbeatControl MOI as a child of the NtfSubscriptionControl MOI.

Fault Supervision Management Services
Fault supervision management services allow a Fault Supervision MnS Provider to report errors and events to a Fault Supervision MnS Consumer and allows a Fault Supervision MnS Consumer to perform fault supervision operations on the Fault Supervision MnS Provider, such as get alarm list.
Stage 1 Fault Supervision MnS is specified in 3GPP TS 28.545 [9].
Stage 2 fault notifications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
Stage 2 AlarmList IOC and AlarmRecord data type are specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].
Stage 3 Solution Sets for XML, JSON and YANG are specified in 3GPP TS 28.623 [15].
Fault Notification
Description
Fault Supervision MnS Provider sends asynchronous Fault notification event to Fault Supervision MnS Consumer when an alarm occurs, is cleared, or changes severity.
Requirements
The following fault supervision data report service requirements specified in 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.5 are supported in O-RAN:
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-1 for sending alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-3 for alarm notification subscription
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-4 for alarm notification unsubscription
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-6 for reading the alarm list
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-8 for reading the alarm list with a filter
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-9 for sending changed alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-10 for sending cleared alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-11 for sending new alarm notifications
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-12 for sending alarm list rebuilt notification
The following requirements from 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.5 are optional in O-RAN:
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-2 for providing alarms for virtualized resources
Rationale: Alarms for virtualized resources are reported over O2 by the O-Cloud.
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-5 for filtering the alarm notifications that are reported
Rationale: Filtering of alarm notifications at the NF level is not recommended.  SMO should receive all alarm notifications generated by the NF.  Filtering is best done at the SMO level.
REQ-FSDR_NF-FUN-7 for maintaining an alarm list for virtualized resources
Rationale: Alarms for virtualized resources are reported over O2 by the O-Cloud.
Procedures
Procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 9.1.
Operations and Notifications
A Fault Supervision MnS notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
An O1-supported 3GPP-specified Fault notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains an O1-supported 3GPP-specified Fault notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
The O1-supported 3GPP-specified Fault notifications are:
notifyNewAlarm
notifyChangedAlarmGeneral and/or notifyChangedAlarm
notifyClearedAlarm
notifyAlarmListRebuilt
NotifyChangedAlarm only supports reporting the severity change. NotifyChangedAlarmGeneral permits the producer to report the severity change and any other attribute changes associated with this alarm in a single notification.  The other 3GPP fault notifications specified in TS 28.532 [4] are optional.  Rationale: There are no use cases defined in O-RAN where these other notifications types are sent.  If Use Cases are defined which send these notification types, then this O1 Interface Specification will be updated.
Fault Supervision Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Management Services Use Cases will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms.   For Fault Supervision, an AlarmList IOC is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14] that represents the capability to store and manage alarm records. There is one AlarmList per Fault Supervision MnS Provider, created by the Provider. The AlarmList contains one AlarmRecord for each active alarm. The AlarmRecords in the AlarmList can be read by the Fault Supervision MnS Consumer, with an optional filter to retrieve selected AlarmRecords based on the value of attributes in the AlarmRecord.  For example, Fault Supervision MnS Consumer is able to retrieve only those AlarmRecords with perceivedSeverity = CRITICAL.
Requirements
Fault supervision data report service requirements from 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.5 that are mandatory for an O-RAN Fault Supervision MnS Provider to support are specified in section 2.2.1.2.
The following fault supervision data control service requirements from 3GPP TS 28.545 [9] Section 5.2.6 are optional for the O-RAN Fault Supervision MnS Provider to support:
REQ-FSDC_NF-FUN-1 to support alarm acknowledgement.
Rationale: There is no Use Case that requires a NF to acknowledge an alarm.  This operation is best done at the SMO level.  If the NF does not support alarm acknowledgement from the MnS Consumer, then the NF must consider cleared alarms as automatically acknowledged so that they may be removed from the AlarmList.
REQ-FSDC_NF-FUN-2 to support manual alarm clearing.
Rationale: Manual clearing of alarms is only for ADMC (Automatically Detected, Manually Cleared) alarms.  If the NF supports ADMC alarms, then this operation should be supported.  Otherwise, it is not required.
REQ-FSDC_NF-FUN-4 to support acknowledgement state change notifications.
Rationale: There is no Use Case that requires a NF to acknowledge an alarm.  This operation is best done at the SMO level.  If the NF supports alarm acknowledgement, then this operation should be supported.  Otherwise, it is not required.
Procedures
NETCONF protocol and YANG data models are used to get and set the attributes of the AlarmRecords in the AlarmList.
Refer to Provisioning management services section for procedures to read MOI attributes and modify MOI attributes using NETCONF.
AlarmList IOC Definition
AlarmList IOC definition is specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.26 and 4.3.27 with attribute definitions in section 4.4.1.
YANG solution set for AlarmList IOC is provided in TS 28.623 [15] appendix D.2.9.

Section 2.3.4 provides requirements for O-RAN defined measurements.   O-RAN defined measurements are named with an “OR.” prefix. Vendor supplied measurements are named with a “VS.” prefix.
Performance Data Streaming
Description
Performance Assurance MnS Provider steams high volume asynchronous streaming performance measurement data to Performance Assurance MnS Consumer at a configurable frequency.  A secure WebSocket connection is established between the Performance Assurance Provider and the Performance Assurance Consumer.  The connection will support the transmission of one or more streams of PM data.  Each stream of PM data is configured as a PerfMetricJob (see section 2.3.3 of this document).  The provider supplies information about the supported streams to the consumer during the connection establishment.  The connection may be established to support one or more streams.  Streams can be added or removed from the connection as the PerfMetricJobs are added or deleted.  The connectionID that will carry the streaming PM data is provided to the Performance Assurance Provider during the establishment of the WebSocket connection by the Performance Assurance Consumer.
Requirements
Requirements for Streaming PM are specified in 3GPP TS 28.550 [10] section 5.2.3.
Procedures
Use Cases are specified in 3GPP TS 28.550 [10] section 5.1.1.3.  Procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.  These procedures are applicable to both Streaming PM and Streaming Trace.

Figure 2.3.2.3-1 Perf Data Streaming Connection Establishment and Data Transmission
Pre-condition:
Performance Assurance MnS Provider is configured to produce PerfMetricJob to be delivered via streaming PM to the Performance Assurance Consumer.
Procedure:
Performance Assurance MnS Provider requests to establish a WebSocket connection to begin streaming PM data and provides MetaData about the streams that are to be sent on the connection
Performance Assurance Consumer accepts the request to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket.
Performance Assurance MnS Provider transmits binary encoded data to consumer while performance job is active.
Operations and Notifications
3GPP TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1 defines the following operations that an O-RAN compliant NF that supports streaming PM must support.  These are the same operations listed for streaming trace in Section 2.4.6.1 of this document.  They are repeated here, as it is possible that a NF may support different levels of streaming for trace and performance assurance.
establishStreamingConnection operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.1.  Establishing the streaming connection is initiated via an HTTPS POST followed by an HTTP GET (upgrade) to establish the WebSocket connection.
terminateStreamingConnection operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.2.  This operation is accomplished via a WebSocket Close Frame to tear down the streaming connection when all stream jobs on this connection have been terminated. The delivery of WebSocket Close Frame is provided by the underlying TCP.
reportStreamData operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.3. The streamData field contains the streaming PM data which is encoded according to the format defined in TS 28.550 [10] Annex G which provides the ASN.1 definition of the Performance Data Stream Units.  The delivery of WebSocket Close Frame is provided by the underlying TCP.
If the NF supports the capability of sending multiple PM streams across the WebSocket connection, the following operations are required for O-RAN NFs.
addStream operation is specified in TS 28.532 Section 11.5.1.4.  This operation is used when a new Performance Assurance Stream (PM job started) is added on the Performance Assurance Provider to be delivered to this consumer and the NF supports multiple streams per connection. The addStream operation is accomplished via an HTTP POST.
deleteStream operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.5.  This operation is used when a Performance Assurance Stream (PM job stopped) is deleted from the connection between the Performance Assurance Provider and the Performance Assurance Consumer.  The deleteStream operation is accomplished via an HTTP DELETE.
The following operations are specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1 but are optional for O-RAN NFs as there is no use case requiring them.
getConnectionInfo operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.6. This operation allows the performance data streaming service provider to get information from the performance data streaming service consumer on the streams active on the connection.  There is no use case in O-RAN requiring this operation.
getStreamInfo operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.1.7. This operation allows the performance data streaming service provider to get the information for one or more streams from the streaming consumer (i.e., stream target).  There is no use case in O-RAN requiring this operation.
No notifications have been defined for Performance Data Streaming.
PM Streaming Data Generation and Reporting
3GPP TS 28.550 [10] Annex C lists all the Performance Data Stream Unit Content Items. Annex C of this document provides a description of the establishment of the WebSocket connection and the subsequent operations that will be provided as part of the data streaming service.  The example utilizes the trace service, but the operations around the establishment and tear down of the connection are the same for streaming PM and streaming Trace.  The WebSocket connection will remain until all streams configured to be provided between the PA Provider and the PA Consumer have been terminated.
PM Streaming Data Format
PM Streaming data will be delivered according to the format specified in the input parameters of the establishStreamConnection operation specified in TS 28.532 [4] section 11.5.1.1.2.
Measurement Job Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, dedicated operations for Performance Assurance Control will be supported by IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms in the Measurement Job Control Service.   For Performance Assurance, this includes operations such as Create Measurement Job, Terminate Measurement Job, Query Measurement Job, Suspend Measurement Job and Resume Measurement Job.   Measurement jobs can be created and terminated by creating and deleting a PerfMetricJob MOI.  Measurement jobs can be queried by getting the attributes of a PerfMetricJob MOI.  Measurement jobs can be temporarily suspended or resumed by modifying the administrativeState attribute of a PerfMetricJob MOI to LOCKED or UNLOCKED.
Requirements
Requirements for measurement job control are specified in TS 28.550 [10] section 5.2.1.
Procedures
Procedures for measurement job creation, termination, query, suspend and resume are specified in TS 28.622 [14]  section 4.3.31.
NETCONF protocol and YANG data models are used to create MOI, delete MOI, modify attributes and get attributes of a PerfMetricJob.  Refer to Provisioning management services section for detailed procedures on how to perform these operations using NETCONF.
PerfMetricJob IOC Definition
PerfMetricJob IOC definition is specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.31 with attribute definitions in section 4.4.1.  SupportedPerfMetricGroup datatype is specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.32.  ReportingCtrl specified in TS 28.622 [14] section 4.3.33.
YANG solution set for PerfMetricJob IOC is provided in TS 28.623 [15] appendix D.2.4.
O-RAN Defined Performance Measurements
Requirements
REQ-OPM-FUN-1:  O-RAN specific counters shall be defined using the template specified in 3GPP TS 32.404 [20].
REQ-OPM-FUN-2:  The Measurement Name for O-RAN defined counters shall not exceed 64 characters in length and should be constrained to 32 characters maximum.
REQ-OPM-FUN-3:  Measurement Name of O-RAN defined counters and/or sub-counters shall begin with OR prefix to indicate that O-RAN is the source of the measurement.  When a measurement is accepted in 3GPP, the OR prefix shall be deleted.
Annex A provides an example of how two O-RAN O-DU counters could be specified following the template in 3GPP TS 32.404 [20].  PLEASE NOTE, the O1 Interface Specification will not be specifying O-RAN counters.  It is the responsibility of the Working Groups to do this specification.  This Annex is informational to provide possible examples for defining counters as required in this document.  O-RAN defined counters will be documented in the appropriate Working Group specifications. Note that these requirements apply to O1 complaint nodes, specifically Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.
Trace Management Services
Trace management services allow a Trace MnS Provider to report file-based or streaming trace records to the Trace MnS Consumer.  Trace Control provides the ability for the Trace Consumer to start a trace session by configuring a Trace Job via the Trace Control IOC or by establishing a trace session that will propagate trace parameters to other trace management providers via signaling.  There are multiple levels of trace that can be supported on the provider as described in 3GPP TS 32.421 [21] Section 4.1. The Trace Provider may be configured to support file-based trace reporting or streaming trace reporting.
Trace Management Services specified in 3GPP TS 32.421 [21], TS 32.422 [22] and TS 32.423 [23] and supported on an applicable O-RAN ME include Call Trace, Minimization of Drive Testing (MDT), RRC Connection Establishment Failure (RCEF) and Radio Link Failure TCE (RLF).  All of these services follow a similar management paradigm. Trace Sessions are configured on the provider with information on where and how to send the trace information to the consumer.  The provider creates trace records within a trace session as the trigger mechanism occurs.  Trace records are produced and provided to the consumer until the trace session is terminated.
File-based trace collects trace records in files that are available to the consumer with a time delay.  In the case of streaming trace, the data is sent in bursts across a WebSocket connection to the consumer, maintaining the relevance of the data while minimizing transport overhead.
Stage 1 Trace Management Service is specified in 3GPP TS 32.421 [21].  Use cases for trace are specified in Section 5.8 and elaborated in TS 32.421 [21] Annex A.  General Trace Requirements are found in TS 32.421 [21] section 5.1.
Stage 2 Trace Operations are found in TS 32.422 [22] for 5G support of Call Trace and for streaming trace.
Stage 2 Trace Control IOC for management-based control is specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [14].  Stage 2 for signaling based activation is found in TS 32.422 [22].
Stage 3 definitions of trace record content for all trace types, XML trace file format, and streaming trace GPB record definition are found in TS 32.423 [23].
Stage 3 Trace Control IOC mapping for management-based control is specified in TS 28.623 [15] section D.2.10.
Stage 2 and 3 definition of streaming data reporting are found in TS 28.532 [4].
Call Trace
Trace Data Reporting
Description
Trace Data can be reported from the Trace Provider to the Trace Consumer via trace files or via a streaming interface. For management-based activation, Trace Data is collected after the TraceJob is configured on the Trace Provider, the Trace Session is activated, and the triggering event occurs. For signaling-based activation, the Trace Recording Session starts when the NF receives trace control and configuration parameters via one of the signalling messages specified in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.2.3.12.
When the Trace Provider collects trace data to a file, the file is periodically provided to the Trace Consumer.  When the provider supports streaming trace, the trace is sent to the consumer via data bursts which are sent frequently enough to retain the relevance of the data while conserving transport resources. The WebSocket connection carrying the streaming trace is preserved for the duration of the streaming trace.
Requirements
Requirements for Trace data are specified in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.2 and are applicable to both file-based and streaming trace.
Procedures
Trace Data is binary encoded and reported in Trace Records.  The procedures for reporting data are specified in TS 32.422 [22] Section 7.  File-based trace reporting procedures are found in TS 32.422 [22] Sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.1.  Streaming trace reporting procedures are found in TS 32.422 [22] Sections 7.1.2 and 7.2.2.  Trace Record Contents are specified in TS 32.423 [23] Section 4. The Trace Record content is the same for trace jobs controlled by management-based activation and signaling-based activation.  The raw trace record content is the same for file-based trace and streaming trace.  Trace data is binary encoded in ASN.1.  File-based trace is delivered in XML format with trace records encoded in ASN.1.  Streaming trace is delivered in GPB encoded data bursts with the trace record payload containing ASN.1 encoded data.
Procedures for naming the trace data file are found in TS 32.423 [23] Annex B.  File Naming Convention is fully specified in TS 32.423 [23] Annex B.1.
Trace files are produced in XML format. The XML format is specified in TS 32.423 [23] Annex A2.2.  Example XML files are provided in TS 32.423 [23] Annex D.
If a trace file cannot be created, a trace failure notification file XML schema should be sent.  The XML schema is provided in TS 32.422 [22] Annex A.5 and the naming convention for the file containing the failure is specified in Annex A.4.
For streaming trace, raw trace data is collected on the node and sent to the trace collector.  The trace data will be binary encoded.  The format of the streaming trace data is provided in TS 32.423 [23].  The reportStreamData operation is specified in TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.4.
Trace Session Activation
Description
A trace session will start on a provider configured to support a TraceJob via management or signaling-based activation.  Management-based trace session activation is initiated from the Provisioning Management Service Consumer to activate a TraceJob which has been configured on the provider.  See Section 2.4.5 of this document.  With signaling-based trace session activation, the provider receives a signaling message that contains trace consumer ID address (IP address for file-based or URI for streaming) along with trace control parameters.  Each Trace session has a unique trace session identifier that is associated with all of the trace data collected for this session.
If the trace session is configured to be file-based, the provider collects the data and stores the data in a file.  The provider optionally sends the file directly to the consumer or sends the location of the file to the consumer.  File transport approach is not standardized.
SA5 Rel 16 introduces the support of streaming trace from the provider to the consumer.  Trace data for a trace session is collected and transmitted to the provider across a secure WebSocket connection in data bursts which are emitted frequently enough to ensure the relevance of the data while conserving transport resources. See section 2.4.6 and Annex C of this document for details on the streaming service.
Requirements
Requirements for Trace Session Activation for file-based and streaming trace are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.3.1.
Procedures
Procedures for activating a Trace Session via management-based control are found in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.1.1 for general procedures and TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.1.9 for NGRAN specific procedures. Procedures for activating a Trace Session via signaling are found in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.2.1 and Section 4.1.2.16.

Trace Recording Session Activation
Description
A trace recording session is a specific instance of the data specified to be collected for a particular trace session, for example, a specific call.  For management-based activation, the trace recording session will start on a provider configured with an active trace session when a triggering event occurs, such as a new call starting.  Each Trace recording session within a trace session has a unique trace recording session reference. This recording session reference and the session reference are included with each trace record, uniquely identifying the trace record as belonging to a particular trace recording session. For signaling-based activation, the Trace Recording Session starts when the NF receives trace control and configuration parameters via a control signalling message. TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.3.2.12 outlines the procedures the node is to follow when determining when to begin a new trace recording session and when to continue with an existing session.
Requirements
Requirements for Trace Recording Session Activation are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.3.2.
Procedures

Trace Control
Description
Starting with 3GPP Release 16, Management-based Trace Control will be supported with IOCs with attributes that can be read and/or set using generic provisioning mechanisms in the Trace Control Service.  For Trace Control, this includes operations such as Create TraceJob, Activate TraceJob, Deactivate TraceJob, and Query TraceJobs.  TraceJobs can be created, activated, deactivated, and queried by setting and/or getting attributes in the TraceJob IOC.  The TraceJob IOC supports Management-based activation for Call Trace, MDT, RLF and RCEF.
Trace sessions can also be activated and deactivated via signalingbased configuration initiated from another NF to propagate a configured trace, such as a UE trace when the UE moves from one NF to another.
Requirements
Management-based activation and deactivation will be done via the TraceJob IOC defined in TS 28.622 [14] Section 4.30.  Requirements for TraceJob Activation are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.3.1 and requirements for TraceJob deactivation are found in TS 32.421 [21] Section 5.4.1.  The requirements are applicable for both Management and Signaling activation.
Procedures
Management-based activation and deactivation will be accomplished using CRUD operations specified in section 2.1 of this document.  The attributes of the TraceJob are specified in TS 28.622 [14] Section 4.3.30.2. Constraints on these attributes are specified in TS 28.622 [14] Section 4.3.30.3.   Trace Control IOC mapping for management-based control is specified in TS 28.623 [15].   The YANG model for the Trace Control IOC is specified in TS 28.623 [15] section D.2.10.
Procedures for Signaling-based Trace Session Activation are found in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.2.
Procedures for Trace Session Deactivation are found in TS 32.422 [22] Section 4.1.4.
Streaming Trace
A NF can be configured to deliver trace data via a file or via a streaming interface.  The streaming capability was introduced in SA5 Release 16.  The additional requirements and procedures supported for streaming trace are provided in this section.  An example of the configuration, activation, recording and termination of a streaming trace connection are shown in Informative Annex C.
Streaming Trace Requirements and Procedures
As noted above, trace session and recording activation and deactivation, as well as the content of the trace record, are the same for file-based and streaming trace.  The requirements for streaming trace delivery are found in TS 32.421 [21]  Section 5.5.  Operations for establishing the streaming connection, adding, and deleting streams from the connection and reporting streaming trace data are found in TS 28.532 [4] Section 11.5.  O-RAN NFs supporting streaming trace must support the establishStreamingConnection, reportStreamData and terminateStreamingConnection operations.  O-RAN NFs that support the multiplexing of trace streams across a single connection must support the addStream and deleteStream operations.  Optionally, the NF may also support the getConnectionInfo and getStreamInfo operations which allow the provider to query for information on the connection and streams on the connection.  This is optional in O-RAN as there are no use cases currently defined that require this operation.  No notifications have been defined for streaming trace.
Stage 3 information on the streaming operations is provided in TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5 with Open API YAML definition provided in Annex 6.1.2.
The procedure for establishStreamingConnection is an HTTP POST operation to provide the information on the stream to the consumer and to receive the Connection ID as a response.  The HTTP POST is followed by an HTTP GET to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket connection.  This operation is used when no connection is established between the provider and the consumer.  The WebSocket connection can contain one or more streams of data from streaming trace or streaming PM. See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.2.
The terminateStreamingConnection is a WebSocket close frame operation.  This operation is used when all streams on a connection have terminated.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.3.
The addStream Operation is an HTTP POST to indicate that additional streams are being added to the connection.  A stream is a trace job or a streaming PM job.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.5.
The deleteStream Operation is an HTTP DELETE to indicate that a stream has been terminated from the connection.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.6.
The reportStreamData is a WebSocket data frame sent across the connection containing the streaming trace or streaming PM data or an optional alive message indicating that the stream is active, but no data is available.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.4.
The getConnectionInfo Operation is an HTTP GET from the provider to the consumer to obtain information about the connection, such as which streams are supported.  See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.7.
The getStreamInfo Operation is an HTTP GET from the provider to the consumer to obtain information on the stream. See TS 28.532 [4] Section 12.5.1.1.8.
Annex C in this document provides a streaming trace activation example for management-based activation control.
File Management Services
File management services allow a File Management MnS Consumer to request the transfer of files between the File Management MnS Provider and the File Management MnS Consumer.
Use cases are based on the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
Relevant 3GPP specifications for file transfer are 3GPP TS 32.341 [17], TS 32.342 [18] and TS 32.346 [19].  Alignment between 3GPP and O-RAN for File Management is targeted for 3GPP SA5 Rel 17.  After the 3GPP CRs are approved, this section will be updated to align with 3GPP.
File Ready Notification
Description
The File Ready Notification notifies a File Management MnS Consumer that a file is available for upload from the File Management MnS Provider.  In general, File Management MnS Provider sends a notifyFileReady notification for files that the File Management MnS Consumer has configured the File Management MnS Provider to collect on a periodic basis, such as file-based Trace Data or PM Measurement Reports.
Requirements
The notifyFileReady notification is specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4], section 11.6.1.1.
The legacy VES fileReady notification is specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36].
Procedures
File Management MnS Consumer configures a File Management MnS Provider to collect data files with specific characteristics that the File Management MnS Consumer desires, such as file-based Trace Data or PM Measurement Reports described in the Performance Assurance Section of this document.  After configuration, the File Management MnS Consumer terminates the configuration session and waits for the File Management MnS Provider to report that the file is ready for collection.
When a file is available, the File Management MnS Provider sends a notifyFileReady notification to the File Management MnS Consumer using REST/HTTPS.

Procedure:
File Management MnS Provider sends notifyFileReady notification to File Management MnS Consumer over HTTP/TLS.  Mutual certificate authentication is performed.
Operations and Notifications
A File Ready notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
An O1-supported 3GPP-specified File Ready notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains an O1-supported 3GPP-specified File Ready notification, as specified in 3GPP TS 28.532 [4].
The O1-supported 3GPP-specified File Ready notification is:
notifyFileReady
File Types Supported
File Type requirements are documented in 3GPP TS 32.341 [17] section 5.2.
File Naming Requirements
File Naming requirements are specified in 3GPP TS 32.342 [18] Annex A.
List Available Files
Description
File Management MnS Consumer queries the File Management MnS Provider to identify files that are available on the File Management MnS Provider.  Upon receipt of the available files and their locations, the File Management MnS Consumer can determine the next appropriate action.
Requirements
Requirements on the types of files are found in section 5.4 of 3GPP TS 32.341 [17].  O-RAN may request that additional file types be specified in Rel-17 as part of the NRM fragment creation for List Available Files.
Procedures
List Available Files Use Case allows the File Management MnS Consumer to obtain a list of available files and their locations by reading the AvailableFileList IOC as specified in 3GPP TS 32.342 [18].  A File Management MnS Consumer may use this management service in scenarios where the File Management MnS Provider is collecting information, such as logs, on a standard basis in support of debugging activities.  Under normal operations, the File Management MnS Provider does not send this data to the File Management MnS Consumer as the File Management MnS Consumer does not need it.  The File Management MnS Provider retains the data with the oldest data being over-written when space is exhausted.  In some scenarios, the File Management MnS Consumer may want to upload some, or all, of the available log files to resolve an issue.  In this case, File Management MnS Consumer sends a NETCONF <get> command to the File Management MnS Provider to obtain the list of available files.  File Management MnS Provider responds with AvailableFileList which contains a list of available files and their locations and file types.  File Management MnS Consumer may use this information to transfer the desired files.  See Transfer File Service section 2.5.3.
The File Management MnS Consumer does not have to initiate a file upload as a result of the obtaining the list of available files.  There are use cases where the File Management MnS Consumer may want to verify that files are being collected or verify that all files of a particular type (PM for example) have been uploaded.

PNF Startup and Registration Management Services
PNF Startup and Registration management services allow a physical PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider to acquire its network layer parameters either via static procedures (pre-configured in the element) or via dynamic procedures (Plug-n-Play) during startup. During this process, the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider also acquires the IP address of the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer for PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider registration. Once the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider registers, the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer can then bring the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider to an operational state.
Relevant 3GPP specifications for PNF Plug-n-Play (PnP) are 3GPP TS 32.508 [24] and TS 32.509 [25].  Additional Plug-n-Play information for IPV6 and other O-RAN extensions can be found in O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
Alignment between 3GPP and O-RAN for PNF startup and registration is targeted for 3GPP SA5 Rel 17.  Normative work includes an update to add the pnfRegistration event and an update to add new DHCP tags for IPv6 and O-RU. After the 3GPP CRs are approved, this section will be updated to align with 3GPP.

PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider sends an asynchronous pnfRegistration or o1NotifyPNFRegistration event to a PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer after PnP to notify PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer of new PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider to be managed.
Requirements
Assuming O-RAN proposes a new Stage 1 spec for PNF Plug-n-Play and Registration, additional PNF Registration requirements will be specified there.  Until that time, the PNF Registration requirements are provided in the VES Event Listener Specification [36].
REQ-PNFR-FUN-1: The PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider shall support sending the PNF Registration Notifications (see clause 2.7.2.4) upon PNF reset and/or registration events resulting in O1 connection re-establishment.
Procedures
Assuming O-RAN proposes a new Stage 1 spec for PNF Plug-n-Play and Registration, the PNF Registration procedures will be specified there.  Until that time, the PNF Registration procedures are provided in this O1 Interface Specification.

Pre-condition:
PNF completes Plug-n-Play.
Procedure:
PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider sends pnfRegistration or o1NotifyPNFRegistration notification event to PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer over HTTP/TLS.  Mutual certificate authentication is performed.
Post-condition:
PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer registers the PNF Startup and Registration MnS Provider so that it can be managed.
Operations and Notifications
A PNF Registration notification can be either an o1NotifyPNFRegistration or a pnfRegistration event. They must be in one of the following formats:
o1NotifyPNFRegistration:
SDO O1 format
The O-RAN-specified o1NotifyPnfRegistration notification defined as following:
CM: Either oamV4IpAddress or oamV6IpAddress must be provided depending upon what the network function supports.
Note: the table describing the content of o1NotifyPnfRegistration may be revised when the IM/DM work (capturing the notification details) is complete.
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains an O-RAN-specified o1NotifyPnfRegistration notification.
pnfRegistration:
VES O1 format
A legacy pnfRegistration VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36].
PNF Software Management Services
Software management services allow a PNF Software MnS Consumer to request a physical PNF Software MnS Provider to download, install, validate and activate a new software package and allow a physical PNF Software MnS Provider to report its software versions.  O-RAN will utilize the liaison to 3GPP to initiate enhancements to the 3GPP specifications for PNF Software Management.  Until those enhancements are put in place, O-RAN PNF Software Management will be described in this specification.  Software management described in this document is modeled on the O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29].
Alignment between 3GPP and O-RAN for PNF software management is targeted for 3GPP SA5 Rel 17. After the 3GPP CRs are approved, this section will be updated to align with 3GPP.
Software Package Naming and Content
PNF Software Package naming, content and format are vendor specific and do not require standardization in O-RAN.  A PNF Software Package may contain one or more files.  Some of the files in the Software Package may be optional for the PNF (example: a file that has not changed version).  The PNF is aware of the content and format of its available Software Packages and can determine which files it needs to download.
The softwarePackage Managed Object Class (MOC) contains attributes about a software package such as:  software package name, version, fileList, integrityStatus (valid, invalid, empty), runningState (active, passive), vendor, productName, softwareType (operational, factory), etc. This MOC is applicable to VNFs and PNFs and is a generic term that O-RAN will use to refer to the software available on the PNF rather than the legacy term of software slot
The PNF creates one instance of softwarePackage for each software package supported concurrently on the PNF.  Typically, a PNF will have two softwarePackage MOIs for operational software; one with runningState = active and one with runningState = passive.  Some PNFs also have a softwarePackage MOI for the factory software which would be read only.  O-RAN may have PNFs that support more than one passive slot.  In this case the inventory query result would show multiple MOIs with runningState=passive.
Software Inventory
Description
The PNF Startup and Registration MnS Consumer sends a Software Inventory Request and retrieves information about the software packages on the PNF Software MnS Provider.
Requirements
Requirements are to be specified in a 3GPP spec for PNF Software Management.  Until that time, the requirements are provided in this O1 Interface Specification.
REQ-SWI-FUN-1:  The PNF software management service provider SHALL have the capability to provide its authorized consumer information about the software packages on the PNF software management service provider.

Procedure:
PNF Software MnS Consumer establishes NETCONF session with PNF Software MnS Provider.  The NETCONF session has authorized execution privileges for retrieve file list and file-download rpcs.
PNF Software MnS Consumer sends NETCONF <rpc><software-download><remote-file-path><softwarePackage> to trigger a download of the software located at remoteFilePath and save its information in softwarePackage.
PNF Software MnS Provider validates the request. Validation includes determining if the operation can be performed. This is PNF Software MnS Provider specific but could include things like: checking that there is not a software download already in progress, softwarePackage is runningState = passive and softwareType = operational, etc.
PNF Software MnS Provider returns NETCONF <rpc-reply><software-download-status>.
PNF Software MnS Consumer terminates NETCONF session with PNF Software MnS Provider.
PNF Software MnS Provider initiates SFTP or FTPES connection and downloads the software package from remoteFilePath.  SFTP is authenticated with username/password, SSH keys or X.509 certificates.  FTPES is authenticated with X.509 certificates.  PNF Software MnS Provider understands the software package format and downloads all the files it needs from the package.  PNF Software MnS Provider decides where to store the software internally.  This is PNF Software MnS Provider specific but could be a temporary location like /tmp.
PNF Software MnS Provider integrity checks the downloaded software.  This is PNF Software MnS Provider specific but could include checking checksum, correct software for the hardware, etc.
PNF Software MnS Provider stores the software in a persistent location.
PNF Software MnS Provider updates softwarePackage attributes for the downloaded software.
(Optional) If the download takes a long time, PNF Software MnS Provider may send periodic downloadFile notifications to the PNF Software MnS Consumer with the current status of the download (download in progress, integrity checks passed, install complete).
When download operation completes, PNF Software MnS Provider sends downloadFile event notification to PNF Software MnS Consumer with the final status of the download (success or the reason for failure).
Operations and Notifications
A File Download notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
Either a 3GPP-specified notifyFileDownload or a O-RAN-specified o1NotifyFileDownload notification should be defined.  The decision on 3GPP or O-RAN is FFS.
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains either a 3GPP-specified notifyFileDownload or a O-RAN-specified o1NotifyFileDownload notification.  The decision on SDO O1 format, stated as FFS above, will determine whether this notification is specified by 3GPP or O-RAN.
Software Activation Pre-Check
Description
Activation Pre-check is an optional Use Case that the Service Provider may choose to utilize prior to software activation to confirm that the PNF Software MnS Provider is in a good state to activate the new software and provide information needed for planning the timing of the software replacement--such as whether a reset or a data migration is required.
Requirements
Requirements are to be specified in a 3GPP spec for PNF Software Management.  Until that time, the requirements are provided in this O1 Interface Specification.
REQ-SPC-FUN-1: The PNF software management service provider SHALL have the capability to confirm that the software in the passive slot targeted for activation is good.
REQ-SPC-FUN-2: The PNF software management service provider SHALL have the capability to determine whether the activation of the targeted software requires a reset and/or data migration.

PNF Software MnS Consumer sends NETCONF <rpc><software-activate><softwarePackage> to trigger an activation of the software in softwarePackage.
PNF Software MnS Provider validates the request. This is PNF Software MnS Provider specific but could include things like checking that there is not a software activation already in progress, softwarePackage is runningState = passive and integrityStatus = valid, etc.
PNF Software MnS Provider returns status to the PNF Software MnS Consumer in the NETCONF <rpc-reply> response.
PNF Software MnS Provider performs the steps needed to make the softwarePackage the active one. This is PNF Software MnS Provider specific but includes things like updating the runningState of the about-to-be-active and previously-active software packages.
PNF Software MnS Consumer terminates NETCONF session with PNF Software MnS Provider.
(Optional) PNF Software MnS Provider performs data migration if necessary. PNF Software MnS Provider knows whether this is necessary.
(Optional) PNF Software MnS Provider performs reset if necessary. PNF Software MnS Provider knows whether reset is necessary. If a reset occurs, PNF Software MnS Provider sends a resetReason notification to the PNF Software MnS Consumer with the reason for the reset; in this case software activation.
(Optional) If the PNF Software MnS Provider can not activate the software, PNF Software MnS Provider shall have recovery logic to fallback to the previously active software and potentially fallback to the factory software in a worst-case scenario.
(Optional) If the activation takes a long time, PNF Software MnS Provider may send periodic softwareActivate notifications to PNF Software MnS Consumer with the current status of the activation (e.g. activation in progress, data migration successful).
After activation operation completes, PNF Software MnS Provider sends a softwareActivate notification to PNF Software MnS Consumer with the final status of the activation.
PNF Software MnS Provider sends notifyMOIAttributeValueChange to the PNF MnS Consumer updating the active software running on the PNF.
Operations and Notifications
A Software Activate notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
Either a 3GPP-specified notifySoftwareActivate or an O-RAN-specified o1NotifySoftwareActivate notification should be defined.  The decision on 3GPP or O-RAN is FFS.
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains either a 3GPP-specified notifySoftwareActivate or an O-RAN-specified o1NotifySoftwareActivate notification.  The decision on SDO O1 format, stated as FFS above, will determine whether this notification is specified by 3GPP or O-RAN.
A reset reason notification is FFS.  See Open Points, section 1.5.
PNF Reset Management Services
PNF Reset Management Services allow a PNF Reset MnS Consumer to trigger a reset of a HW unit of a PNF Reset MnS Provider on command.
PNF Reset Command
Description
The PNF Reset Command procedure allows a PNF Reset MnS Consumer to trigger a reset of a HW unit of a PNF Reset MnS Provider on command.  Any HW unit that is resettable via a reset command must be represented by a managed object instance (MOI) and is able to be identified by a distinguished name (DN).  The NETCONF RPC <reset> command identifies the unit to reset by the DN.  The unit to reset may be the entire PNF or a resettable HW subcomponent of the PNF.  A resettable HW subcomponent of a PNF is a subcomponent of a PNF that is able to be independently reset and whose PNF Reset MnS Provider supports a reset command for the subcomponent. It is vendor and PNF-specific whether a PNF has resettable HW subcomponents.  The reset command also has an attribute to identify the type of reset requested.  The types of reset commands that a PNF supports are vendor and PNF specific.  O-RAN O1 Interface Specification specifies two mandatory reset command types that every PNF must support: conditional and forced.  A conditional reset command can be rejected by the PNF Reset MnS Provider depending on the conditions on the PNF, for example if the unit to reset is not in a proper state to reset, such as, if there is an emergency call in progress on the unit.  A valid forced reset command cannot be rejected.  Valid means that the unit to reset supports a reset command. Invalid forced resets will be rejected, for example, if the unit to reset is not a resettable HW unit, such as a cell.  Vendors are allowed to extend the O1 specified reset command types to add vendor and PNF specific reset command types.
Requirements
REQ-RM-FUN-1: The PNF Reset MnS Provider shall support the capability for a PNF Reset MnS Consumer to trigger a reset of a HW unit of the PNF Reset MnS Provider on command.
REQ-RM-FUN-2: The PNF Reset MnS Provider shall support reset command types conditional and forced.
REQ-RM-FUN-3: The PNF Reset MnS Provider shall be allowed to reject a conditional reset command type.  NOTE: The validations performed and the reasons for a conditional reset rejection, if any, are vendor and PNF specific.
REQ-RM-FUN-4: The PNF Reset MnS Provider shall not be allowed to reject a valid forced command reset type. NOTE: Valid means that the unit to reset supports a reset command. Invalid forced resets will be rejected, for example, if the unit to reset is not a resettable HW unit, such as a cell.
Procedures
This procedure shows how a PNF Reset MnS Consumer triggers a reset of a HW unit of a PNF Reset MnS Provider on command.  The HW unit to reset is identified by the <unitToReset> input attribute.  The type of reset command is identified by the <resetCommandType> input attribute. The <status> output attribute returned in the NETCONF response indicates whether the reset command has been accepted.  The unit is reset after the NETCONF response is returned. The reason for the reset (e.g., conditional reset command or forced reset command) is persistently stored by PNF Reset MnS Provider before executing the reset

Pre-conditions:
PNF Reset MnS Consumer has established a NETCONF session to the PNF Reset MnS Provider as specified in Provisioning Management Services, section 2.1.11.  The NETCONF session has authorized execution privileges for <reset> RPC.
(Optionally) PNF Reset MnS Consumer has locked the appropriate DS of the PNF Reset MnS Provider as specified in Provisioning Management Services, section 2.1.13.
Procedure:
PNF Reset MnS Consumer sends NETCONF <rpc> <reset> <unitToReset><resetCommandType> to PNF Reset MnS Provider, indicating the unit to reset and the type of reset command.
PNF Reset MnS Provider validates the command.  Validation is vendor and PNF specific but should include verifying that the <unitToReset> is resettable and can be reset at this time.  A conditional reset command type allows the PNF Reset MnS Provider to reject the reset command, depending on the conditions on the PNF, for example if an emergency call is in progress.  The conditions are vendor and PNF specific.  A valid forced reset command type cannot be rejected. Valid means that the unit to reset supports a reset command. Invalid forced resets will be rejected, for example if the unit to reset is not a resettable HW unit, such as a cell.  If the reset command is accepted, the reset reason (e.g., conditional reset command or forced reset command) is stored persistently on the PNF Reset MnS Provider.
PNF Reset MnS Provider responds, indicating in the <status> attribute whether the command is accepted.  If the command is rejected, the <rpc-reply> contains an <rpc-error> element with the reason for the rejection.
Unit is reset.
Post-conditions
(Optionally) PNF Reset MnS Consumer unlocks the DS of the PNF Reset MnS Provider after sending the reset command, as specified in Provisioning Management Services, section 2.1.14.
(Optionally) PNF Reset MnS Consumer terminates the NETCONF session to the PNF Reset MnS Provider after sending the reset command, as specified in Provisioning Management Services, section 2.1.12.
Operations
Information Model and YANG solution set for the NETCONF RPC <reset> command and its attributes will be specified in the O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification [33].
Notifications
REQ-RN-FUN-1: A PNF MnS Provider shall support the capability to inform a PNF MnS Consumer that a reset has occurred and the reason that a HW unit has reset.
REQ-RN-FUN-2: A PNF MnS Provider shall save the reason for a reset persistently before resetting.  Note that this requirement applies to resets that occur under the control of the PNF.
REQ-RN-FUN-3: If a reset reason has not been saved persistently, the PNF MnS Provider shall set the reset reason to unknown in the notification.  Note that this requirement applies to resets that occur unexpectedly before the reset reason could be stored.
Cloudified NF Registration Management Service
The Cloudified NF Registration Management Service supports the registration of a Cloudified NF Registration Management Service Provider to the Cloudified NF Registration Management Service Consumer after the Cloudified NF instantiation via the O2 has completed and the NF application has initialized and is ready for final configuration and management (e.g., ready to be put in service).  Application initialization includes things like setting up the NETCONF server, creating MOIs for the NF, and perhaps some vendor specific steps which can take place after the Cloudified NF instantiation completes.  The Cloudified NF Registration MnS is applicable to VNFs and CNFs and supports the NF informing the SMO when it has completed its initialization steps and is ready to be managed.  Without this service, the SMO would have to poll the NF until the NF responded that it had completed its application initialization and was ready for final configuration (if needed) and management.  Registration is accomplished by sending a Cloudified NF Registration notification.
Cloudified NF instantiation is specified in the O2 DMS Specification to be published.
Cloudified NF Registration Notification
Description
To register, the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider sends an asynchronous o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration event to a Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer to notify the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer of a new Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider to be managed. The Cloudified NF Registration Provider will periodically send the o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration event (at vendor specified intervals) until a NETCONF session is established. This indicates that the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider has registered, and the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer can begin managing the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider and bring the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider to an operational state.  Note that the o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification does not require a subscription.  It is sent after the application comes up if a Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer address (e.g., IP@ or FQDN) is obtained during instantiation or is pre-provisioned.  The o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification is also sent after a restart for the VNF/CNF.  It is FFS whether the o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification must be sent if a partial restart occurs such as the restarting of a single POD.
Requirements
REQ-CNFR-FUN-1: The Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider shall support the capability to send a o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification to the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer when it has completed instantiation and application initialization and is ready for final configuration and to be managed by the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer.
REQ-CNFR-FUN-2: The Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider shall support the capability to send a o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification to the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer when it completes a restart.
Procedures
The Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider sends an asynchronous HTTP/TLS o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification to the Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer after it has been instantiated via the O2 interface, completed application initialization and is ready for final configuration and to be managed (put into service).

Pre-condition:
NF has been instantiated via the O2.
Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer address is obtained during instantiation or is pre-provisioned.
Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider has completed application initialization and is ready to be managed.
Procedure:
Cloudified NF Registration MnS Provider sends o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification to Cloudified NF Registration MnS Consumer over HTTP/TLS. Mutual certificate authentication is performed.
Operations and Notifications
A Cloudified NF Registration notification must be in one of the following formats:
SDO O1 format
An O-RAN-specified o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification as will be specified in the O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification [33].
VES O1 format
A Harmonized VES event, as specified in the VES Event Listener Specification [36], containing stndDefinedFields with a "data" element that contains an O-RAN-specified o1NotifyCloudNFRegistration notification.
Annex A: (Informative) O-RAN Performance Measurement Definition Example
A.1 3GPP TS 32.404 PM Template Usage
Two examples are presented below to illustrate how to use the 3GPP TS 32.404 [20] template to specify O-RAN defined O1 compliant performance measurements.  The O-RAN defined O1 compliant PM counters will be defined using this template and documented in the appropriate O1 Interface Specification, e.g. O1 Interface Specification for Near-RT RIC [28], O1 Interface Specification for O-CU-UP and O-CU-CP [30] and O1 Interface Specification for O-DU [31]. Note that this PM template applies to O1 complaint nodes, specifically Near-RT RIC, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU.  O-RU is not an O1 compliant node and hence O-RU counters are specified in O-RAN Fronthaul Management Plane Specification [29], Annex B, using an O-RU specific template format.
We expect that the MF-specific O1 Interface Specifications will contain a template similar to table A.1.1.1 for each counter defined and that these tables will be part of the official documentation.

Annex B: (Informative) Guidelines and Example for stndDefined VES Events
B.1: Guidelines for use of stndDefined VES for sending 3GPP-specified or O-RAN-specified O1 notifications
A stndDefined VES event, as specified in VES Event Listener Specification [36], allows a VES event to carry, as its payload, a notification specified by an SDO.  In the case of O-RAN O1 Interface Specification, a harmonized stndDefined VES event carries either a 3GPP-specified O1 notification or an O-RAN-specified O1 notification as its payload.
3GPP has published an informative Annex B in TS 28.532 [4] providing guidelines for the integration of 3GPP-specified notifications with VES.  This Annex expands on the information provided by 3GPP, including information on how to include O-RAN-specified O1 notifications in a VES stndDefined event.
When an O-RAN and 3GPP compliant ME supports VES stndDefined events for sending asynchronous notifications, a3GPP-specified O1 notification, as defined by 3GPP, or an O-RAN-specified O1 notification, as defined by O-RAN, is included in the event.
A VES common event header, as defined by VES Event Listener Specification [36], is added to the notification.
In VES, the domain field in the common event header is used to route the event to the proper consumers and to map to a schema for the event payload.  VES Event Listener Specification [36] added a new domain field enumeration value called stndDefined that indicates that the event is complying with a schema defined by a standards body.
An additional field was added to the VES common event header called stndDefinedNamespace, which contains a valid namespace as defined by the standards body.  This field is only populated when the domain is stndDefined.  3GPP has defined four namespaces in TS 28.532 [4] Annex B; namely 3GPP-Provisioning, 3GPP-Heartbeat, 3GPP-FaultSupervision and 3GPP-PerformanceAssurance.  Likewise, O-RAN must specify namespaces for the notifications it defines.  A VES collector uses the stndDefinedNamespace, along with the stndDefined domain, to route the event to the correct consumer.
A stndDefined VES event has a field structure called stndDefinedFields, specified in VES Event Listener Specification [32].  This structure contains three properties:
schemaReference (type = string, format = uri)
data (JSON object which should be identical to the 3GPP or O-RAN notification)
stndDefinedFieldsVersion (type = string, format = enum)
The schemaReference, if present, should be used to verify that the notification content is correct.  3GPP is publishing the notification schemas, in JSON format, to a public repository, (https://forge.3gpp.org/rep/sa5) so that schema references can be included in the event.  Likewise, O-RAN will publish its notification schemas, in JSON format, in a public repository.  This repository is still to be created.
The data element contains either a 3GPP-specified O1 notification, in JSON format, as specified in 28.532 [4] or an O-RAN-specified O1 notification, in JSON format, as specified in O-RAN Information Model and Data Models Specification [33].
The stndDefinedFieldsVersion provides the version of the stndDefinedFields structure, as defined by VES Event Listener Specification [36].
Annex B.2 provides an example of a stndDefined VES event for a new alarm notification.
B.2: Example stndDefined VES event for a new alarm notification
The following example illustrates the population of a new alarm notification using a stndDefined VES event.
The VES Common Header is shown from line 44 through line 58.  Note that it contains:
the domain set to stndDefined
the stndDefinedNamespace set to 3GPP-FaultSupervision.
The stndDefinedFields structure begins on line 59.  Note that it contains:
the 3GPP schema reference for the 3GPP fault notification type
the data element which contains the full 3GPP notifyNewAlarm fault notification
the version of the stndDefinedFields.

Figure C-1 :  Streaming Trace Connection Establishment, Data Reporting and Deactivation Example
Scenario
Provisioning Management Service Consumer activates/configures Trace Session on Trace Provider.  This will be accomplished using Provisioning Management services described in Section 2.1 of this document.
Trace Provider sends a notifyMOIChanges to indicate the new MOI is created.
Steps 3-6 are optional when no connection to trace MnS consumer exist.
Trace Provider needs to establish a connection to the Trace Consumer to set up a streaming connection (streams are active at this time between the Provider and Consumer). This is done using the establishStreamingConnection Operation via an HTTP POST request containing MetaData associated with this Trace Session.
Trace Consumer responds with an acknowledgement that contains the ConnectionID needed by the Provider when requesting that the connection be upgraded to a WebSocket to support streaming of the trace data.
Trace Provider requests the upgrade of the connection to a WebSocket using the ConnectionID and an HTTP GET operation.
Trace Consumer accepts the upgrade and WebSocket is established.  WebSocket will remain connected until the last streaming trace session active on the Trace Provider is ended.  Note in this example, only one streaming trace session is active.
Optionally addStream operation is used to add a stream to the trace connection.
Trace Provider starts trace session, waiting for triggering event to occur.
Trace Provider sends trace session start administrative message to Trace MnS Consumer.
Heartbeat sending criteria are met. The criteria about when to send Trace stream heartbeat administrative message are implementation specific.
Trace stream heartbeat administrative message is sent to Trace consumer repeatedly. Trace stream heartbeat administrative message is used for monitoring whether the trace session connection is alive and can be executed parallel to other loops.
“start” triggering event detected.
A new trace recording session is started on the Trace Provider.  Each trace recording session has a unique Trace Recording Session (TRS) Reference associated with it.
Trace recording session start administrative message is sent from Trace MnS Provider to Trace MnS Consumer.
While this trace record is active, and the reporting criteria are not fulfilled, the Trace MnS Provider collects trace data.
When the reporting criteria are fulfilled, either timer expires or the buffer fills, or the buffer has data and the “stop” triggering event is detected, the Trace Provider sends a trace data report to the Trace Consumer containing trace record data for active recording sessions in a trace session.  These records are the payload of the reportStreamData operation.
The criteria for the trace recording session completion or stop occurs (call ends, etc.).
The Trace Provider stops collecting data for this trace recording session.
Trace Provider sends trace recording session stop administrative message to Trace MnS Consumer.
Provisioning Management Service Consumer deactivates the trace via procedures defined in section 2.1 of this document.  Deactivation means that the trace data collection should cease, and the Trace Provider should stop all active trace recording sessions and send data that it has collected up to this point, if any, for each active trace recording to the Trace Consumer.
Trace Provider initiates the termination of the trace session.
For each active trace recording session, Trace Provider initiates a Stop Trace Recording Session.
Optionally if there are outstanding record(s) for this trace recording session that have not been streamed to the Trace Consumer, Trace Provider sends them as the payload of the reportStreamData operation.
Trace Provider informs the Trace Consumer that this Trace Recording Session has ended by sending the trace record termination administrative message. The producer repeats this until all trace recording sessions for this trace session have been terminated.
Trace MnS Provider sends the trace session stop administrative message to Trace MnS Consumer.
Optionally the Trace Provider sends the Trace Consumer the deleteStream operation indicating that the stream has been removed in case the connection is used for multiple streams.
Optionally when all active Trace Sessions between Trace Provider and Trace Consumer have ended, the WebSocket connection is to be torn down.  Trace MnS Provider sends the Trace MnS Consumer the terminateSignalingConnection Operation which is a WebSocket close frame.
Terminate connection.
Annex ZZZ: O-RAN Adopter License Agreement
BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY O-RAN SPECIFICATION, ADOPTER AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
This O-RAN Adopter License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between the O-RAN Alliance and the entity that downloads, uses or otherwise accesses any O-RAN Specification, including its Affiliates (the “Adopter”).
This is a license agreement for entities who wish to adopt any O-RAN Specification.
Section 1: DEFINITIONS
1.1 “Affiliate” means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity, so long as such control exists. For the purpose of this Section, “Control” means beneficial ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the voting stock or equity in an entity.
1.2 “Compliant Implementation” means any system, device, method or operation (whether implemented in hardware, software or combinations thereof) that fully conforms to a Final Specification.
1.3 “Adopter(s)” means all entities, who are not Members, Contributors or Academic Contributors, including their Affiliates, who wish to download, use or otherwise access O-RAN Specifications.
1.4 “Minor Update” means an update or revision to an O-RAN Specification published by O-RAN Alliance that does not add any significant new features or functionality and remains interoperable with the prior version of an O-RAN Specification. The term “O-RAN Specifications” includes Minor Updates.
1.5 “Necessary Claims” means those claims of all present and future patents and patent applications, other than design patents and design registrations, throughout the world, which (i) are owned or otherwise licensable by a Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor during the term of its Member, Contributor or Academic Contributorship; (ii) such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor has the right to grant a license without the payment of consideration to a third party; and (iii) are necessarily infringed by a Compliant Implementation (without considering any Contributions not included in the Final Specification). A claim is necessarily infringed only when it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the date any Final Specification was published by the O-RAN Alliance or the date the patent claim first came into existence, whichever last occurred, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate a Compliant Implementation without infringing that claim. For the avoidance of doubt in exceptional cases where a Final Specification can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which infringe patent claims, all such patent claims shall be considered Necessary Claims.
1.6 “Defensive Suspension” means for the purposes of any license grant pursuant to Section 3, Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates, may have the discretion to include in their license a term allowing the licensor to suspend the license against a licensee who brings a patent infringement suit against the licensing Member, Contributor, Academic Contributor, Adopter, or any of their Affiliates.
Section 2: COPYRIGHT LICENSE
2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, O-RAN Alliance hereby grants to Adopter a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, non-sublicensable, worldwide copyright license to obtain, use and modify O-RAN Specifications, but not to further distribute such O-RAN Specification in any modified or unmodified way, solely in furtherance of implementations of an ORAN Specification.
2.2 Adopter shall not use O-RAN Specifications except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in a separate written agreement with O-RAN Alliance.
Section 3: FRAND LICENSE
3.1 Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors and their Affiliates are prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Adopter under Fair Reasonable And Non- Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license shall not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Adopter if that Adopter is not making a reciprocal grant to Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors, as set forth in Section 3.3. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Adopter’s distributors and the use by the Adopter’s customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations.
3.2 Notwithstanding the above, if any Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter or their Affiliates has reserved the right to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee for its license of Necessary Claims to Adopter, then Adopter is entitled to charge a FRAND royalty or other fee to such Member, Contributor or Academic Contributor, Adopter and its Affiliates for its license of Necessary Claims to its licensees.
3.3 Adopter, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be prepared to grant based on a separate Patent License Agreement to each Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates under Fair Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and conditions with or without compensation (royalties) a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable (but subject to Defensive Suspension), non-sublicensable, worldwide patent license under their Necessary Claims to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, lease, sell and otherwise distribute Compliant Implementations; provided, however, that such license will not extend: (a) to any part or function of a product in which a Compliant Implementation is incorporated that is not itself part of the Compliant Implementation; or (b) to any Members, Contributors, Academic Contributors, Adopters and their Affiliates that is not making a reciprocal grant to Adopter, as set forth in Section 3.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing licensing commitment includes the distribution by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ distributors and the use by the Members’, Contributors’, Academic Contributors’, Adopters’ and their Affiliates’ customers of such licensed Compliant Implementations.
Section 4: TERM AND TERMINATION
4.1 This Agreement shall remain in force, unless early terminated according to this Section 4.
4.2 O-RAN Alliance on behalf of its Members, Contributors and Academic Contributors may terminate this Agreement if Adopter materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure or is not capable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days after being given notice specifying the breach.
4.3 Sections 1, 3, 5 - 11 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Under surviving Section 3, after termination of this Agreement, Adopter will continue to grant licenses (a) to entities who become Adopters after the date of termination; and (b) for future versions of ORAN Specifications that are backwards compatible with the version that was current as of the date of termination.
Section 5: CONFIDENTIALITY
Adopter will use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication, and dissemination of O-RAN Specifications to third parties, as Adopter employs with its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care.
