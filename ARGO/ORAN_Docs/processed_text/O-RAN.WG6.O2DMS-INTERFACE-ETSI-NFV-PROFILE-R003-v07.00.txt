2.1	Introduction
The O-RAN framework follows similar principles as other frameworks and solutions related to network functions virtualisation and cloudification that have been or are being specified in other organizations, such as in the ETSI NFV. O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] documents a set of use cases regarding the deployment of O-RAN NF on O-Clouds, as well as it specifies relevant functional and interface requirements between the SMO and O-Cloud. O-RAN.WG6.CAD [3] documents the cloudification deployment aspects of O-RAN NF based on VMs, OS container in VMs, or OS containers. These same forms of NF deployment are also considered by the ETSI NFV framework.
With the objective to reuse existing network operator assets, e.g., as presently in use in other network deployments beyond RAN, the present document aims at specifying a profile of the ETSI NFV specifications that can also be used for the deployment of O-RAN NF on O-Clouds.
The present O-Cloud O2dms profile based on ETSI NFV demarcates a defined protocol and data model between the SMO and O-Cloud based on the standardized virtualised resource, containerized workload, and VNF management capabilities of the functional entities and functions of the NFV-MANO architectural framework summarized in clause 2.2.
In the definition of the applicable protocol and data models to profile, two main demarcations can be defined depending on the end point of interaction of the SMO towards the O-Cloud:
-	"O2-D demarcation #1": SMO interacts with a DMS that offer VNFM-like functionality. This case considers a more abstract "NF Deployment" view, i.e., DMS supports deployment of defined O-RAN NFs. The "NF Deployment" view is also referred in numerous use cases of O-RAN-WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2]. The "NF Deployment" concept is defined in the O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4] and O-RAN.WG6.CAD [3]. Clause 2.2.1 of the same O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4] describes the DMS as the functional block responsible for the management of NF Deployments into the O-Cloud.
-	"O2-D demarcation #2": SMO interacts with a DMS that offers virtualised resource/containerized workload management functionality; thus, SMO performs VNFM-like functionality. This case considers a more granular "virtualised resource/containerized workload" management view, i.e., DMS has no notion at all of O-RAN NFs.
These two demarcation cases are depicted in figures 2.1-1 and 2.1-2, respectively.
NOTE 1:	VIM/CISM and NFVI/CIS placement in the architecture figures are not meant to be accurate and it is not the focus of these figures to present the architectural mappings of other elements such as SMO, NFVO, etc. Purpose of the figures is to illustrate the demarcations/boundaries of applicability for the O2dms ETSI NFV profiles.
NOTE 2:	More information about the NFV-MANO architectural framework is provided in clause 2.2.
The present document version specifies an ETSI NFV profile of the O2dms protocol and data models based on the "O2-D demarcation #1".
NOTE 3:	A profile based on "O2-D demarcation #2" is FFS.
2.2	ETSI NFV framework and solutions
ETSI NFV defines the NFV-MANO architectural framework, which is conformed of a set of functional blocks, functions and interfaces enabling the deployment and management of VM and container-based VNFs. The management of virtualised and container-based resources is performed by technology and solution agnostic functional entities according to a specified set of interfaces, models and APIs.
The list of NFV-MANO architectural framework functional blocks and functions and their main responsibilities are:
-	Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM): responsible for the management of virtualised resources (virtual compute, virtual network and virtual storage) in the NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) and VM software images,
-	Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM): responsible for the management of container-based resources and container workloads in Container Infrastructure Service (CIS) clusters,
-	Container Image Registry (CIR): responsible for the management of OS container software images,
-	VNF Manager (VNFM): responsible for the management of VNFs, including their lifecycle, and provides corresponding management services based on a common set of interfaces and models regardless of the technology used for implementing the VNF, be it container or VM-based, and
-	NFV Orchestrator (NFVO): responsible for the management of VNF Packages and other artifacts and the overall orchestration of NFVI resources across multiple sites (referred as well as NFVI-PoPs) and the lifecycle management of Network Services (NS).
ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010 [8] specifies the principles and scope of the NFV-MANO architectural framework and functional requirements of the functional blocks and functions that are part of it.
A set of groups specifications (GS) specifies the interfaces exposed and consumed by the NFV-MANO functional blocks and functions. The following are the GS of relevance for the present document:
-	ETSI GS NFV-IFA 007 [7] specifies stage 2 interfaces and associated information model of interfaces between the NFVO and the VNFM. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] specifies stage 3 protocols and data models of these interfaces based on RESTful. The Release 4 version of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] adds support for container-based VNF deployments. Refer to clause 2.4.1 for the specific version and features (VM and/or OS container-based deployments) supported by the present document.
-	ETSI GS NFV-IFA 005 [5] specifies stage 2 interfaces and associated information models of interfaces between the NFVO and the VIM, which aim, among others features, at supporting VM-based NF deployments. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 014 [16] specifies a stage 3 data model of parameters for virtualised resource descriptors based on YAML.
-	ETSI GS NFV-IFA 006 [6] specifies stage 2 interfaces and associated information models of interfaces between the VNFM and the VIM, which aim, among others features, at supporting VM-based NF deployments. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 014 [16] specifies a stage 3 data model of parameters for virtualised resource descriptors based on YAML.
-	ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 [9] specifies stage 2 interfaces and service requirements of interfaces produced by the CISM and CIR, which aim, among other features, at supporting OS container-based NF deployments. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 018 [18] aims at specifying stage 3 protocols and data models of these interfaces profiled on de-facto solutions. Refer to clause 2.4.1 for the specific version and features (VM and/or OS container-based deployments) supported by the present document.
In addition to the composition of the NFV-MANO architectural framework in terms of functional blocks, functions and interfaces, one of the key aspects is the definition of both design-time and runtime elements. Design-time elements basically comprise those objects and artifacts that describe the design and requirements for the deployment of entities into or using the framework. The design-time objects comprise packages and descriptors, among which the relevant ones for the present document are the VNF Package and VNF Descriptor (VNFD).
-	ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12] specifies stage 2 requirements related to VNF Package and VNF metadata and the information model of the VNFD. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10] specifies stage 3 data model of the VNFD (in addition to other descriptors such as Network Service Descriptor (NSD) and Physical Network Function Descriptor (PNFD)) based on TOSCA, while ETSI GS NFV-SOL 006 [14] specifies the same elements but based on YANG. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 [13] specifies the data model and structure of the VNF Packages.
2.3	ETSI NFV profiling for O2dms interfaces
2.3.1	General
The present and subsequent clauses describe specific aspects of the ETSI NFV profiling for the O2dms interfaces. In the present profiling version based on the "O2-D demarcation #1" introduced in clause 2.1, the functional capabilities of the NFVO, VNFM, VIM and CISM of the NFV-MANO architectural framework are mapped to the O-RAN framework as defined in clause 2.3.2.
The O2dms ETSI NFV profile based on "O2-D demarcation #1" is based on the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] specifies, among others, the RESTful API of the "VNF Lifecycle Management interface", which is used as the foundation for providing a DMS exposed API for the lifecycle management of NF Deployments of O-RAN. Specific API correspondences are defined in clause 2.3.3.
Finally, for the orchestration and management operations through the O2dms ETSI NFV profile, it is assumed that descriptors and packaging of corresponding NF Deployments, and consequently of O-RAN NF, are on-boarded and available to the SMO and DMS. In particular, it is expected that the descriptors and packaging for O-RAN NF contain relevant metadata such as identifiers of the design-time definitions of components/constituents of an NF Deployment, which are also information either conveyed or exposed through the API. Additional mapping information about descriptor and packaging artifacts is provided in clause 2.3.2, and reference to specific elements concerning various orchestration aspects are further described in clause 2.5.
2.3.2	Conceptual mappings
The terminology and concepts used in referenced ETSI NFV specifications differs compared to the terminology used in O-RAN specifications.
Table 2.3.2-1 defines the mapping and correspondences of management concepts and terms applicable for the O2dms service APIs and to the profiling specified in the present document version.
Table 2.3.2-1: Concepts mapping
Table 2.3.2-2 defines the mapping and correspondence of management functions and functional blocks that apply to endpoints of the O2 interface and to the profiling specified in the present document version.
Table 2.3.2-2: Management functions/functional blocks mapping
2.3.3	API mappings
The APIs specified in the present document map to the referenced standard APIs listed in table 2.3.3-1.
Table 2.3.3-1: API mappings
2.4	Service operations
2.4.1	Overview
The present document provides the protocol and data model profiling for the O2dms interface based on the ETSI NFV standards and covering a specific subset of service interfaces and operations. The defined service interfaces and operations are listed in the subsequent clauses.
The service interfaces and operations specified in the present document references the latest published Release 4 version of the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11], which is the one used in the protocol and data model profiling in clause 3. As indicated in clause 2.2, the Release 4 version of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] adds support for OS container-based NF deployments, and some relevant features are also documented in clause 2.5.
2.4.2	NF Deployment lifecycle management
2.4.2.1	Instantiate NF Deployment
Clause 3.2.1 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] describes the use case of "Instantiate Network Function on O-Cloud", which includes steps of requesting the lifecycle management operation of instantiating NF Deployments. Related requirements are specified in clause 4.3 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2]. In addition, clause 3.7.1 of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4] lists for the O-Cloud the capability of deploying an O-RAN Cloudified NF instance.
To instantiate an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) creation of "Individual VNF instance" resource corresponding to the NF Deployment as illustrated by the "Flow of the creation of a VNF instance resource" in clause 5.3.1 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of creation of the VNF instance resource is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.1-1.
-	2) instantiation of the NF Deployment by triggering the operation "Instantiate VNF" performed via the corresponding task resource "Instantiate VNF task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF instantiation is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.1-1.
NOTE 1:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] VNF instantiation procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the NF Deployment instantiation procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.
Figure 2.4.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the instantiation of an NF Deployment including the two sub-procedures introduced above.

NOTE 2:	Due to possible race conditions, the 201 response and the VnfIdentifierCreationNotification can arrive in any order at the SMO.
NOTE 3:	Due to possible race conditions, the 202 response and the "STARTING" VnfLcmOperationOccurrenceNotification can arrive in any order at the SMO.
The procedure of NF Deployment instantiation consists of the following steps as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.1-1:
NOTE 4:	The procedure does not illustrate error cases, only successful procedure steps.
Precondition: None.
1)	The SMO sends a POST request to the "VNF instances" resource including in the payload body a data structure of type "CreateVnfRequest".
2)	The DMS checks the availability of the NF Deployment package (referred as VNF Package in the figure) and creates a new "Individual VNF instance" resource that represents the NF Deployment.
NOTE 5:	It is expected that the NF Deployment package contents are available to the O-Cloud DMS, or that the DMS can check the availability of the package as onboarded to the SMO.
3)	The DMS returns a 201 Created response containing a representation of the "Individual VNF instance" resource, which represents the NF Deployment, and provides the URI of the newly created resource in the "Location” HTTP header. See note 2.
4)	The DMS sends a VNF Identifier Creation Notification to the SMO to indicate the creation of the "Individual VNF instance" resource and the associated VNF instance identifier of the NF Deployment, if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications. See note 2.
5)	The SMO sends a POST request to the "Instantiate VNF task" resource that represents the NF Deployment instantiation lifecycle operation to be executed on the NF Deployment and includes in the payload body a data structure of type "InstantiateVnfRequest".
6)	The DMS creates a new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resources for the request, which represents the lifecycle operation occurrence about the NF Deployment instantiation.
7)	The DMS returns a "202 Accepted" response with an empty payload body and a "Location" HTTP header that points to the new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource. See note 3.
8)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate the start of the lifecycle management operation occurrence with the "STARTING" state, if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications. See note 3.
9)	The DMS checks the granted resources, placement information and availability of deployment items for the NF Deployment instantiation.
10)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence enters the "PROCESSING" state, if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
11)	The DMS proceeds with the NF Deployment instantiation with the allocation of necessary O-Cloud resources.
12)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the ongoing lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
13)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
14)	The DMS completes the NF Deployment instantiation.
15)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence is "COMPLETED", if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
16)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the completed lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
17)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
Postcondition: The NF Deployment is instantiated and in "INSTANTIATE" state.
Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.
2.4.2.2	Terminate NF Deployment
Clause 3.2.5 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] describes the use case of "Terminate Network Function on O-Cloud", which includes steps of requesting the lifecycle management operation of terminating NF Deployments. Related requirements are specified in clause 4.3 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2]. In addition, clause 3.7.1 of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4] lists for the O-Cloud the capability of terminating an O-RAN Cloudified NF instance.
To terminate an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) termination of the NF Deployment by triggering the operation "Terminate VNF" performed via the corresponding task resource "Terminate VNF task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF termination is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.2-1.
-	2) deletion of the "Individual VNF instance" resource representing the NF Deployment as illustrated by the "Flow of the deletion of a VNF instance resource" in clause 5.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of deletion of the VNF instance resource is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.2-1.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.
Figure 2.4.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the termination of an NF Deployment instance including the two sub-procedures introduced above.

Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.
2.4.2.3	Query NF Deployment information
NOTE:	The O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] neither describes use cases about querying information of "NF Deployment" or O-RAN NF, nor specifies related functional and interface requirements. Clause 3.7.1 of the O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4] lists the querying information about an O-RAN Cloudified NF instance as one of the expected functional capabilities of the O-Cloud. The profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 provides the capabilities to query information about "NF Deployments" by enabling the necessary HTTP methods on corresponding REST resources. This provides a more complete set of functionalities to the SMO to query information about NF Deployments that have been instantiated. The present document version includes such a functionality and service operation, even though it is not a target for the O-RAN WG6’s "2022 March Train".
To query information about one or more NF Deployment instances using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	To query information about multiple NF Deployment instances, execute a GET method on the "VNF instances" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of the Query VNF operation" in clause 5.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of query information of multiple VNF instances is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.3-1.
-	To query information about a specific NF Deployment instance, execute a GET method on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of the Query VNF operation" in clause 5.3.5 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of query information of a  particular VNF instance is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.3-1.
Figure 2.4.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure flow for querying information about a specific NF Deployment instance or multiple ones.

2.4.2.4	Heal NF Deployment
2.4.2.4.1	Overview
Clause 3.6 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] describes use cases about recovery at different level. Clause 3.6.2 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] details the "NF Deployment level reset use case". According to the use case, when some fatal error is identified which is expected (but not guaranteed) it can be resolved by resetting the NF Deployment, the SMO can send a specific reset request to the DMS over the O2dms interface. In addition, clause 3.7.1 of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4] lists for the O-Cloud the capability of healing an O-RAN Cloudified NF instance. From the ETSI NFV profile perspective, the (part of) reset capabilities can be performed via a "Healing VNF instance" operation.
As defined in ETSI GR NFV 003 [30], VNF healing is a lifecycle procedure that includes all virtualisation-related corrective actions to repair a faulty VNF, and/or its VNFC instances and internal VNF Virtual Links (refer to concepts mapping in clause 2.3.2). The procedure is intended to leverage the resource virtualisation management capabilities such as, starting/stopping/restarting VMs, re-allocating VMs or containerized workloads, and other possible actions, as means to recover from faulty conditions of the VNF. Furthermore, VNF healing can be performed on-demand when a consumer explicitly requests to the producer of the lifecycle management operation or automatically triggered by the producer, also referred as "auto-healing", based on various inputs such as indicators, alarms and KPIs processed from the VNF and/or infrastructure.
NOTE:	As described above, VNF healing considers virtualisation-related corrective actions, and it does not cover other possible VNF correction actions at the application level.
The healing capabilities of a VNF are defined by the VNF provider through the VNF descriptors. The specific list of parameters to convey the trigger of what healing action to perform are also defined through VNF descriptors (see generic information modelling in clause 7.1.5.6 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12]). Healing actions can be different between VNFs and there are no specific means specified by the referenced ETSI NFV specifications to determine what actions are applicable to a VNF instance and not to another VNF instance as this are regarded to be VNF-specific and implementation dependent. From an interface perspective, the VNF healing operation enables the consumer to provide the list of expected parameters and their values as defined in the actual descriptors delivered by the VNF provider in the VNF package. Dedicated LCM scripts (see clause 7.1.13 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12]) either defined via the VNF descriptors or as additional artifacts implement the logic of the concrete procedure actions. The details of the request inputs to trigger the NF Deployment healing are specified in clause 3.2.6.2.9.
2.4.2.4.2	On-demand healing
To perform the on-demand heal of an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) healing of the NF Deployment by triggering the operation "Heal VNF" performed via the corresponding task resource "Heal VNF task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF healing is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.4.2-1.
NOTE 1:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] VNF healing procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the NF Deployment healing procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.
Figure 2.4.2.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the healing of an NF Deployment including the sub-procedure introduced above.

Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.
2.4.2.4.3	Auto-healing
To perform the auto-healing of an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) auto-healing of the NF Deployment triggered by the DMS based on the detection of the healing condition following the flow illustrated in "Flow of automatic invocation of VNF scaling and VNF healing" in clause 5.3.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF healing is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.4.3-1.
NOTE 1:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] VNF auto-healing procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the NF Deployment healing procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
For the DMS to trigger the auto-healing, two conditions shall be met:
-	The auto-healing is enabled on the NF Deployment. This, in the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 based profile, is controlled via setting the corresponding attribute value of "isAutohealEnabled" in the "vnfConfigurableProperties" of the "VnfInstance" data type that represents the NF Deployment instance (see clause 3.2.6.2.2) and that the DMS manages. Changing the value of the attribute is made upon request by the API consumer (e.g., the SMO) by "patching" the corresponding "Individual VNF instance" resource of the NF Deployment. Patching and NF Deployment does not require re-instantiating the NF Deployment.
NOTE 2:	PATCHing of the "Individual VNF instance" resource, which represents the NF Deployment, to support modifying information of an NF Deployment is supported as indicated in clause 3.2.3.
-	The healing condition is met, e.g., by monitoring alarms related to faults of virtualised resources/containerized workloads part of the NF Deployment, NF Deployment-specific indicators like "health degradation" and/or performance data (via PM jobs or Thresholds) of the NF Deployment such as degradation of input/output packet transfer on connection points of the NF Deployment. The criterion for fulfilling the condition is NF Deployment-specific and implementation dependent and not specified in the present document.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow “Flow of managing subscriptions” in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation. The API consumer can know that the operation has been triggered automatically as the attribute "isAutomaticInvocation" of the "VnfLcmOperationOccurrenceNotification" (see clause 3.2.5.2) and the “VnfLcmOpOcc” (see clause 3.2.6.2.6) is set to "true".

2.4.2.5	Scale NF Deployment
2.4.2.5.1	Overview
Clauses 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] describe use cases about scaling out and scaling in of NF, respectively. According to the use cases, NFs can be scaled out/in by adding/removing resources from the NF Deployments that conform the NF. In the use cases, scaling is performed based on a management request from the SMO, who sends a specific request to the DMS over the O2dms interface to scale the NF Deployment.
As defined in ETSI GR NFV 003 [30], VNF scaling is the ability to dynamically extend/reduce resources of a VNF, and it can include scaling up/down and scaling out/in. In particular, the scaling out/in refers to the ability to scale by adding/removing resource instances to a VNF. For instance, in the case of a VM-based VNF, scaling out will add instances of VM to the VNF, while scaling in will remove VM instances to the VNF; and in the case of a container-based VNF, scaling out will add instances of one or a set of OS containers (aka Pod), while scaling in will remove instances of one or a set of OS containers.
The scaling capabilities of a VNF are defined by the VNF provider through the VNF descriptors. The specific list of parameters to convey the trigger of what scaling aspect and levels can be performed are also defined through VNF descriptors (see generic information modelling in clause 7.1.5.4 and 7.1.5.5 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12]). The scaling can also be handled in two forms:
-	Scale VNF: scaling a VNF by defining which aspects to scale and by which number of scaling steps, and
-	Scale VNF to Level: scaling a VNF to a specified scaling or VNF instantiation level.
More information about the concepts of scaling a VNF instance is available in clause B.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The following clauses document the service operation of NF Deployment scaling considering the mappings of NF Deployment to VNF according to the present document.
Scaling of an NF Deployment can be triggered in two ways:
-	Scaling based on a management request: in this case, the DMS receives and processes a management request sent by the API consumer (SMO). The corresponding procedure is further specified in clause 2.4.2.5.2.
- 	Auto-scaling: in this case, the DMS automatically invokes the scaling of the NF Deployment based on some criteria, such as changes in values of monitoring parameters (e.g., clause 7.1.11 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12] specifies capabilities to define monitoring parameters and Indicators of a VNF) that can be monitored by the DMS on the NF Deployment. The corresponding procedure is further specified in clause 2.4.2.5.3.
2.4.2.5.2	Scaling based on management request
To perform scaling of an NF Deployment based on an explicit management request using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) scaling of the NF Deployment by triggering the operation "Scale VNF" performed via the corresponding task resource "Scale VNF task" or the operation "Scale VNF to Level" performed via the corresponding task resource "Scale VNF to Level task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF scaling is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.5.2-1.
NOTE 1:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] VNF scaling procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the NF Deployment healing procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.
Figure 2.4.2.5.2-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the scaling of an NF Deployment including the sub-procedure introduced above.

Figure 2.4.2.5.2-1: Flow of NF Deployment scaling based on management request
NOTE 2:	Due to possible race conditions, the 202 response and the "STARTING" VnfLcmOperationOccurrenceNotification can arrive in any order at the SMO.
The procedure of NF Deployment scaling based on management request consists of the following steps as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.5.2-1:
NOTE 3:	The procedure does not illustrate error cases, only successful procedure steps.
Precondition: "Individual VNF instance" resource representing the NF Deployment is in INSTANTIATED state.
1)	The SMO sends a POST request to the "Scale VNF task" resource that represents the NF Deployment scaling lifecycle operation to be executed on the NF Deployment and includes in the payload body a data structure of type "ScaleVnfRequest".
2)	Alternatively, to step 1, the SMO sends a POST request to the "Scale VNF to Level task" resource that represents the NF Deployment scaling to level lifecycle operation to be executed on the NF Deployment and includes in the payload body a data structure of type "ScaleVnfToLevelRequest".
3)	The DMS creates a new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resources for the request, which represents the lifecycle operation occurrence about the NF Deployment scaling.
4)	The DMS returns a "202 Accepted" response with an empty payload body and a "Location" HTTP header that points to the new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource. See note 2.
5)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate the start of the lifecycle management operation occurrence with the "STARTING" state if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications. See note 2.
6)	The DMS checks the granted resources, placement information and availability of deployment items for the NF Deployment scaling. The DMS also checks the specific actions (e.g., terminate and create new deployment unit, restart a deployment unit, etc.) to be performed for the scaling based on the information contained in the descriptors of the NF Deployment.
7)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence enters the "PROCESSING" state if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
8)	The DMS proceeds with the NF Deployment scaling with the allocation, termination, and restart of necessary O-Cloud resources.
9)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the ongoing lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
10)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
11)	The DMS completes the NF Deployment scaling.
12)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence is "COMPLETED” if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
13)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the completed lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
14)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
Postcondition: The NF Deployment is scaled and in "INSTANTIATED" state.
Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.
2.4.2.5.3	Auto-scaling
To perform the auto-scaling of an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) auto-scaling of the NF Deployment triggered by the DMS based on the detection of the scaling condition following the flow illustrated in "Flow of automatic invocation of VNF scaling and VNF healing" in clause 5.3.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF scaling is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.5.3-1.
NOTE 1:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] VNF auto-scaling procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the NF Deployment scaling procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
For the DMS to trigger the auto-scaling, two conditions shall be met:
-	The auto-scaling is enabled on the NF Deployment. This, in the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 based profile, is controlled via setting the corresponding attribute value of "isAutoscaleEnabled" in the "vnfConfigurableProperties" of the "VnfInstance" data type that represents the NF Deployment instance (see clause 3.2.6.2.2) and that the DMS manages. Changing the value of the attribute is made upon request by the API consumer (e.g., the SMO) by "patching" the corresponding "Individual VNF instance" resource of the NF Deployment. Patching an NF Deployment does not require re-instantiating the NF Deployment.
NOTE 2:	PATCHing of the "Individual VNF instance" resource, which represents the NF Deployment, to support modifying information of an NF Deployment is supported as indicated in clause 3.2.3.
-	The scaling condition is met, e.g., by monitoring performance metrics of virtualised resources/containerized workloads part of the NF Deployment, NF Deployment-specific indicators like "capacity usage" and/or performance data (via PM jobs or Thresholds) of the NF Deployment such as degradation of input/output packet transfer on connection points of the NF Deployment. The criterion for fulfilling the condition is NF Deployment-specific and implementation dependent and not specified in the present document. As a pre-condition, the DMS is expected to have the necessary information and/or policies to determine the fulfilment of the auto-scaling criterion, e.g., as contained in the NF Deployment descriptor when such descriptor is made available to the DMS. See also note 5.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation. The API consumer can know that the operation has been triggered automatically as the attribute "isAutomaticInvocation" of the "VnfLcmOperationOccurrenceNotification" (see clause 3.2.5.2) and the "VnfLcmOpOcc" (see clause 3.2.6.2.6) is set to "true".
NOTE 3:	The referenced current version of the O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] does not describe use cases about O-RAN NF auto-scaling. The present procedure flow might have to be updated in future versions of the present document in case additional or changed requirements are derived in case O-RAN NF auto-scaling use cases are described in future versions of the referenced document.
Figure 2.4.2.5.3-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the auto-scaling of an NF Deployment including the sub-procedure introduced above.

Figure 2.4.2.5.3-1: Flow of NF Deployment auto-scaling
The procedure of NF Deployment auto-healing consists of the following steps as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.5.3-1:
NOTE 4:	The procedure does not illustrate error cases, only successful procedure steps.
Precondition: "Individual VNF instance" resource representing the NF Deployment is in INSTANTIATED state, auto-healing is enabled on the "Individual VNF instance resource", and DMS has information/policies to determine a scaling condition and is monitoring the NF Deployment.
NOTE 5: The provision of the information/policy criterion for the auto-scaling is not in scope of the present procedure flow. It is expected the SMO provides such criterion to the DMS. Clause 3.2.2.2 of O-RAN-WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] indicates that SMO has policies (or configuration) related to NF capacity modification.
1)	The DMS detects a scaling condition that triggers the auto-scaling of the NF Deployment and selects the appropriate parameters for the operation to proceed based on the information contained in the descriptors of the NF Deployment or operational policies.
2)	The DMS creates a new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resources for the operation, which represents the lifecycle operation occurrence about the NF Deployment auto-scaling.
3)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate the start of the lifecycle management operation occurrence with the "STARTING" state if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
4)	The DMS checks the granted resources, placement information (see clause 2.5.2 and 3.2.6.5 which document related information) and availability of deployment items for the NF Deployment auto-scaling. The DMS also checks the specific actions (e.g., terminate and create new deployment unit, restart a deployment unit, etc.) to be performed for the auto-scaling based on the information contained in the descriptors of the NF Deployment.
5)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence enters the "PROCESSING" state if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
6)	The DMS proceeds with the NF Deployment auto-scaling with the allocation, termination, and restart of necessary O-Cloud resources.
7)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the ongoing lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
8)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
9)	The DMS completes the NF Deployment auto-scaling.
10)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence is "COMPLETED” if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
11)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the completed lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
12)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
Postcondition: The NF Deployment is automatically scaled and in "INSTANTIATED" state.
Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.
2.4.2.6	Change external connectivity of an NF Deployment
With the change external connectivity operation, the following types of connectivity changes of an NF Deployment are supported:
-	Disconnect external CPs from the NF Deployment that are connected to a particular external VL and connect them to a different external VL.
-	Disconnect external CP instances of an NF Deployment that represent subports in a trunk and delete them. The external CP that represents the "parent" port on the trunk cannot be neither deleted, nor disconnected, and it can only reconnect to a different external VL.
-	Change the connectivity parameters of existing external CP, e.g., changing L3 addresses.
-	Create new external CP that represent subports in a trunk and connect them to a particular external VL. The operation does not support creating the parent port of the trunk.
To perform the change external connectivity of an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) changing external connectivity of the NF Deployment by triggering the operation "Change external VNF connectivity" performed via the corresponding task resource "Change external VNF connectivity task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of VNF scaling is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.6-1.
NOTE 1:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] changing external VNF connectivity procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the NF Deployment healing procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.

2.4.2.7	Change current NF Deployment package
Clause 3.2.4 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2] describes the use case of "Software upgrade of NF", which includes steps of deploying NF with new software and terminating the previously deployed NF in a build-and-replace software upgrade approach. Other possible approaches are mentioned as well, such as "break-fix" or "in-place upgrade". Related requirements are specified in clauses 4.1 and 4.3 of O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2]. In the general capabilities of O-Cloud Deployment Lifecycle Management listed in clause 3.7.2 of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4], a reference is also made to the capability of O-Cloud supporting upgrading of any or all components of an O-RAN Cloudified NF instance.
The functionality of software modification of a VNF are covered in the ETSI NFV framework by a specified VNF lifecycle management operation named "Change current VNF package". This operation provides "in-place upgrade" capabilities, i.e., a VNF’s software can be modified without need to perform a fresh new deployment. In the case of ETSI NFV framework, a "build-and-replace" approach is covered by reusing the VNF lifecycle management operations of "VNF instantiation" and "VNF termination". Both operations are profiled in the present document in the context of managing the lifecycle of NF Deployments, refer to clauses 2.4.2.1 and 2.4.2.2, respectively.
NOTE 1:	In the case of "build-and-replace", it is assumed that the SMO is in control of when the "old" NF Deployment instance can be terminated, e.g., by monitoring data collected via the O1.
NOTE 2:	"Current NF Deployment package" means the NF Deployment (software) package from which a given NF Deployment instance is based on at a specific point in time. For instance, at a given point in time NF Deployment instance #A1 is deployed and runs based on the content from NF Deployment package #A.v1. By changing the "current NF Deployment package", the lifecycle process changes the NF Deployment instance to run based on the content from another NF Deployment package. Following with the example, for instance, the NF Deployment instance #A1 is updated to run based on the content of NF Deployment package #A.v2.
With the change of current package of an NF Deployment, the following types of changes/modifications on an NF Deployment are supported:
-	Changes of the NF Deployment virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads, such as their requirements in terms of infrastructure resources or the composition of sets of resources, but without changing the software version of the NF Deployment.
-	Changes both, of the software version of the NF Deployment and the virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads. In this case, the software is changed by means of performing tasks and management on the sets of virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads. For instance, a virtualised resource running a current software version can be terminated and a new virtualised resource be instantiated running a different software version.
-	Changes related to the NF Deployment descriptor. This supports the correction of bugs in the descriptors, changes in naming schemes used in the descriptors, etc.
During the procedure of changing the current NF Deployment package, the DMS can add temporary virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads. And as indicated above, during such procedure adding and removal of virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads can also be performed as needed by the process.
To perform the change of current NF Deployment package using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) changing the current NF Deployment package by triggering the operation "Change current VNF package" performed via the corresponding task resource "Change current VNF package task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-7procedure of change current VNF package is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.7-1.
NOTE 3:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] changing current VNF package procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the change current NF Deployment package procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.
Figure 2.4.2.7-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the changing current NF Deployment package including the sub-procedure introduced above.

13)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
Postcondition: The current NF Deployment package has been changed and the NF Deployment is in "INSTANTIATED" state.
Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.
2.4.2.8 Change NF Deployment flavour
An NF Deployment may have one or more NF Deployment flavours. An NF Deployment flavour is a deployment configuration that describes a specific deployment of an NF Deployment supporting specific KPIs, such as capacity and performance, or capabilities, such as specific NF Services.
NOTE 1:	No reference to a specific use case from the O-RAN.WG6.ORCH-USE-CASES [2].
The functionality of changing the flavour of an NF Deployment is specified in the VNF lifecycle management as a dedicated operation named "Change VNF flavour".
During the procedure of changing the NF Deployment flavour, the DMS can add temporary virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads. And as indicated above, during such procedure adding and removal of virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads can also be performed as needed by the process and the requested new deployment configuration.
To perform the change NF Deployment flavour using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
-	1) changing the NF Deployment flavour by triggering the operation "Change VNF flavour" performed via the corresponding task resource "Change VNF Flavour task" on the "Individual VNF instance" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of VNF lifecycle management operations triggered by task resources" in clause 5.3.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the sub-procedure of change VNF flavour is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.2.8-1.
NOTE 2:	While the profiled ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] changing VNF flavour procedure contains steps related to VNF LCM granting exchanges between the VNFM and the NFVO of the NFV-MANO framework, the change NF Deployment flavour procedure specified in the present document version does not contain these steps.
In addition, to monitor the status of the lifecycle operation in an asynchronous mode and be able to know the status of the operation (e.g., whether in progress or in some failed status), the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment lifecycle management events following the flow "Flow of managing subscriptions" in clause 5.3.8 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. The API consumer may also monitor the status of a lifecycle operation by query and reading information about the VNF LCM operation occurrence, which tracks the progress of the lifecycle operation.
Figure 2.4.2.8-1 illustrates the procedure flow for the changing current NF Deployment package including the sub-procedure introduced above.

NOTE 4:	The procedure does not illustrate error cases, only successful procedure steps.
Precondition: "Individual VNF instance" resource representing the NF Deployment is in INSTANTIATED state.
1)	The SMO sends a POST request to the "Change VNF flavour task" resource that represents the changing NF Deployment flavour lifecycle operation to be executed on the NF Deployment and includes in the payload body a data structure of type "ChangeVnfFlavourRequest".
2)	The DMS creates a new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resources for the request, which represents the lifecycle operation occurrence about the changing of NF Deployment flavour.
3)	The DMS returns a "202 Accepted" response with an empty payload body and a "Location" HTTP header that points to the new "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource. See note 3.
4)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate the start of the lifecycle management operation occurrence with the "STARTING" state if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications. See note 3.
5)	The DMS checks the granted resources, placement information and availability of deployment items for the change of NF Deployment flavour. The DMS also checks the specific actions (e.g., allocate, modify, or terminate existing O-Cloud resources) to be performed for the change of NF Deployment flavour based on the information contained in the descriptors of the NF Deployment and the current runtime information held about the NF Deployment.
6)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence enters the "PROCESSING" state if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
7)	The DMS proceeds with the change of NF Deployment flavour with the allocation, modification and/or termination of necessary O-Cloud resources.
8)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the ongoing lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
9)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
10)	The DMS completes the change of NF Deployment flavour.
11)	The DMS sends to the SMO a VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence notification to indicate that the lifecycle management operation occurrence is "COMPLETED” if the SMO is subscribed to such type of notifications.
12)	If desired, the SMO can poll the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource to obtain information about the completed lifecycle operation by sending to the DMS a GET request to the "Individual VNF LCM operation occurrence" resource.
13)	The DMS returns to the SMO the information about the operation by providing in the payload body a data structure of type "VnfLcmOpOcc".
Postcondition: The NF Deployment flavour has been changed and the NF Deployment is in "INSTANTIATED" state.
Error handling: If the NF Deployment lifecycle operation fails, error information is provided in the notification messages that reports about the erroneous completion of the procedure. Error information is also available in the resource that represents the "Individual VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence" related to the NF Deployment lifecycle management operation.

2.4.4.6	Delete a threshold
The functionality of deleting a threshold associated to a VNF is covered in the ETSI NFV framework by the specific VNF performance management operation named "Delete Threshold".
To delete a threshold associated to an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following procedure is applicable:
1) Delete a threshold by triggering the operation "Delete Threshold" on the specific "Individual threshold" resource following the flow illustrated in "Flow of deleting thresholds" in clause 6.3.7 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the procedure is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.4.6-1.

2.4.4.7	Sending performance related notifications
Sending notifications related to performance management of a VNF is covered in the ETSI NFV framework by the specific VNF fault management operation named "Notify". Therefore, performance management events, such as the availability of a performance report or a crossing of a threshold, are raised and sent by means of notifications.
To perform the issuing of performance management notifications associated to an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following procedure is applicable:
1) Send a notification following the flow illustrated in "Flow of sending notifications" in clause 6.3.9 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the procedure is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.4.7-1.
In addition, to monitor the raised events in an asynchronous mode and be able to receive the corresponding notifications, the API consumer shall request the creation of corresponding subscriptions to NF Deployment performance management events. This is performed by providing in the procedures of creating PM jobs and thresholds the notification endpoint URI in the corresponding request messages.
Figure 2.4.4.7-1 illustrates the procedure flow for sending performance related notification associated to an NF Deployment.

The variable <<Notification>> in the flow is a placeholder for the different types of notifications that can be send via this service, including performance report availability and threshold crossing notifications.
3)	The SMO acknowledges the successful delivery of the notification by returning to the DMS a "204 No Content" response.
Postcondition: The SMO has received the notification.
Error handling: If the DMS does not receive the "204 No Content" response from the SMO, it can retry sending the same notification.
2.4.4.8	Obtaining performance reports
The functionality of obtaining performance reports of a VNF is not covered in the ETSI NFV framework by a specific VNF fault management operation, but rather by the joint functionality provided by the notification and query report procedures.
To obtain the performance reports generated from PM jobs associated to an NF Deployment using the present O2dms API profile, the following sub-procedures are applicable:
1) Receive a notification about the availability of performance information" and then query the "Individual performance report" resource following the alternative #1 in the flow illustrated in "Flow of obtaining performance reports" in clause 6.3.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the procedure is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.4.8-1.
2) Query/read list of available performance reports generated from a PM job, and then query the "Individual performance report" resource following the alternative #2 in the flow illustrated in "Flow of obtaining performance reports" in clause 6.3.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. For the case of an NF Deployment, the procedure is further profiled as illustrated in figure 2.4.4.8-1.

NOTE:	The procedure does not illustrate error cases, only successful procedure steps.
Precondition: The PM job has been created.
1)	The DMS send to the SMO a PerformanceInformationAvailableNotification (see clause 2.4.4.7). The notification indicates the availability of a new performance report. The notification includes a link from which the report can be obtained.
2)	Alternatively, the SMO can get the list of performance reports generated from a PM job by sending a GET request to the "Individual PM job" resource. The representation of the "Individual PM job" can include information about performance reports that are available for this PM job, including their links.
3)	In case of the SMO requesting the information of the PM job, the DMS returns a "200 OK" response, including a data structure of type "PmJob" in the message content.
4)	Based on the information received either from step 1) or step 3), the SMO sends to the DMS a GET request to the URI obtained in those steps. The GET request addresses, by using corresponding identifiers, the particular "Individual PM job" resource and "Individual performance report" of interest.
5)	The DMS returns a "200 OK" response to the SMO and includes a data structure of type "PerformanceReport" in the message content.
Postcondition: The performance report has been retrieved by the SMO.
Error handling: In case of failure, appropriate error information is provided in the response.
2.5	Orchestration aspects with O2dms ETSI NFV profile
2.5.1	Resource groups and tenancy
For the deployment and lifecycle of NF Deployments either or both, virtualised resources and containerized workloads are necessary. Virtualised resources and/or containerized workloads are allocated from O-Cloud Node Clusters built from O-Cloud resource pools. The O-Cloud resource pools can also be shared or common for the deployment of multiple O-RAN NF. This is typically realized by enabling features such as resource groups and multi-tenancy.
In the ETSI NFV-profiled O2dms interface, resource grouping and multi-tenancy is achieved by conveying over the O2 interface information that identifies the resource groups and tenant users to which the NF Deployments relate to in the form of "VIM connection info". The data type "VimConnectionInfo", defined in clause 3.2.6.3.2, serves such purposes.
The "VimConnectionInfo" contains attributes that support determining the type and specific function to use for resource infrastructure management of the O-Cloud resources assigned to the O-Cloud Node Cluster. Types of infrastructure management solutions that can be used are registered in the ETSI NFV registry of VIM-related information [19]. The structure of the registry is defined in Annex C of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11].
The ETSI NFV registry of VIM-related information [19] contains entries to support VM and containerized workloads management such as:
-	Registry entries related to VM-based resource management: a) registration of ETSINFV.OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE.V_2, i.e., OpenStack® with Keystone V2, and b) registration of ETSINFV.OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE.V_3, i.e., OpenStack® with Keystone V3, and
-	Registry entries related to containerized workloads management: a) registration of ETSINFV.KUBERNETES.V_1, i.e., Kubernetes®, b) registration of ETSINFV.DOCKER.V_2, i.e., Docker® registry as CIR, and c) registration of ETSINFV.HELM.V_3, i.e., Helm® as MCIOP Repository.
NOTE 1:	Void.
NOTE 2:	The OpenStack® Word Mark and OpenStack Logo are either registered trademarks/service marks or trademarks/service marks of the OpenStack Foundation, in the United States and other countries and are used with the OpenStack Foundation’s permission.
NOTE 3:	The Kubernetes® Word Mark and Kubernetes Logo are either registered trademarks/service marks or trademarks/service marks of The Linux Foundation, in the United States and other countries and are used with the Linux Foundation’s permission.
NOTE 4:	The Helm® Word Mark and Helm Logo are either registered trademarks/service marks or trademarks/service marks of The Linux Foundation, in the United States and other countries and are used with the Linux Foundation’s permission.
NOTE 5:	The Docker® and the Docker logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Docker, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.
Information about "VIM connection info" shall be known to the SMO as pre-requisite to perform NF Deployment lifecycle.
The resources that are granted for consumption from the resource pools can be further grouped by "infrastructure resource groups", which can be mapped to logical groupings of virtualised resources assigned to a tenant (or user) within the O-Cloud. This is represented by the "resourceGroupId" attribute in the "ResourcePlacement" defined in clause 3.2.6.5.3.
In the case of containerized workloads, the logical grouping of a particular set of identifiers, resources, policies and authorizations is realized by means of "namespaces". In addition, namespace quotas define the upper limit on specific types of resources that can be used to deploy containerized workloads within the scope of a namespace. This is represented by the "containerNamespace" attribute in the "ResourcePlacement" defined in clause 3.2.6.5.3.
2.5.2	Placement information and constraints
Placement information and constraints for NF Deployments are conveyed in the O2dms ETSI NFV profile out-of-band from the O2dms_LifecycleDeployment API. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] specifies data types which carry relevant information about placement and constraints, and such data types are either exchanged via the granting procedures or provided as placement requirements information in the descriptors.
NOTE 1:	In the present document version, granting exchanges are not specified. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] defines the "VNF LCM granting interface" as the mechanism to convey placement and constraints information "in-band" from an API perspective.
NOTE 2:	Various forms for conveying placement and constraints information are possible, including: a) using some form of additional grant-less (no grant exchanges) API interactions, b) using declarative descriptors or configuration files, c) using granting exchanges conforming to those defined by ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11], or d) a combination thereof. However, the present document version does not specify support for any of these specifically and it is left for specific deployment or implementation.
The present clause describes the relevant information as defined in the "ResourcePlacement" type in clause 3.2.6.5.3 and "ResourcePlacementConstraint" type in clause 3.2.6.5.4. The information that can be conveyed using these types shall be made available to the DMS as a pre-condition for the instantiation of an NF Deployment by means not specified by the present document (see also note 2).
Relevant attributes and types are:
-	"vimConnectionId": since there can be multiple connections to underlaying infrastructure resource management functions, the scope of management of an entity implementing such a function also determines a level of placement control. For instance, infrastructure resource management entities can be associated to manage resources of specific O-Cloud Node Clusters. Therefore, by indicating the VIM connection to use, a selection of which O-Cloud Node Cluster can be determined for a given NF Deployment to manage.
-	"zoneId": resource zones provide a physical segregation of O-Cloud resources within an O-Cloud Site, and by identifying them, it can be controlled to which zone a resource is expected to be deployed.
-	"ResourcePlacementConstraint": the type represents information about the placement constraints for two or more resources or containerized workloads of an NF Deployment in terms of affinity and anti-affinity and for diverse scope levels, such as O-Cloud Site, resource zones within an O-Cloud Site, and O-Cloud Nodes. The information about affinity and anti-affinity is typically provided by the deployment descriptors of the NF Deployment.
NOTE 3:	In the case of the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11], such a descriptor is referred as VNFD. Refer also to the description in table 2.3.2-1 of the present document.
Containerized workloads can also have specific deployment constraints. Examples of deployment constraints are the following: defining specific O-Cloud Nodes to be used for the deployment or capabilities of the O-Cloud Nodes such as support for acceleration. The "mcioConstraints" attribute in the "ResourcePlacement" type defined in clause 3.2.6.5.3 can be used to convey these specific deployment constraints.
2.5.3	Network connectivity for NF Deployments
Network connectivity information of NF Deployments in the O2dms ETSI NFV profile is exposed and/or conveyed via specific data types. Furthermore, in terms of network connectivity the profile modelling is based on the following key concepts: virtual links and connection points.
A virtual link is an abstraction of a network, which is used by the management and orchestration functions in the ETSI NFV architectural framework. Once applied to the O-RAN framework, virtual links also become an abstraction of connectivity which is exposed and used over the O2dms interface. Virtual links can be realized in various forms such as virtual/overlay networks in an O-Cloud site, or a composition of various networks. Virtual links can be internal or external to an NF Deployment:
-	Internal virtual link: it expresses the connectivity between the components or constituents of an NF Deployment.
-	External virtual link: it expresses the connectivity external to the NF Deployment, i.e., networks that are used to interconnect among NF Deployments, or between NF Deployments and other entities such as to other O-RAN NF, xApps, or even other systems such as management and orchestration ones.
Internal virtual links can be modelled in two forms depending on the entity that manages the resources realizing the virtual link:
-	NF Deployment virtual link: it denotes an internal NF Deployment virtual link that is managed by the DMS. The data type providing information about such kind of virtual link is named "VnfVirtualLinkResourceInfo" (see clause 3.2.6.3.9).
-	Externally-managed virtual link: it denotes an internal NF Deployment virtual link that is managed externally to the DMS, e.g., in the present profiling case the SMO. The data type providing information about such kind of virtual link is named "ExtManagedVirtualLinkInfo" (see clause 3.2.6.3.7).
NOTE 1:	The reason for differentiating the two types comes from the fact that there are deployment cases where the network resources are managed by organizations or systems different to those managing the NF Deployments.
A connection point is also an abstraction that denotes the port/interface of connectivity of an NF Deployment or a constituent within an NF Deployment to a network. Similarly, as with the virtual link case, connections points are further qualified as internal or external connections points of an NF Deployment.
-	Internal connections points: these are the connection points used to connect to the internal virtual links of an NF Deployment. The structured "vnfcCpInfo" attribute in the "VnfcResourceInfo" provides information about such kind of connection point (see clause 3.2.6.3.8).
-	External connection points: these are the connection points used to connect the NF Deployment to the external virtual links. The data type providing information about such kind of connection point is named "VnfExtCpInfo" (see clause 3.2.6.3.4).
Figure 2.5.3-1 illustrates the composition of an NF Deployment and the relationship with the networking concepts.
Figure 2.5.3-1: NF Deployment and networking concepts
External connection points can be associated to various types of other connection points. For instance, an external connection point can be realized by an actual internal connection point of an NF Deployment, i.e., the internal connection point is re-exposed externally and used for connecting to the external virtual link, or it can also be realized by associating the external connection point directly with an internal virtual link. The former case is the one illustrated in figure 2.5.3-1. The type of the connection point and how it relates to the other constituents of an NF Deployment is denoted by a series of specific attributes in the "VnfExtCpInfo".
In addition, other specific connection points are also defined depending on how they are further realized or mapped to.
-	Virtual IP connection point: it denotes a connection point which is basically a Virtual IP (VIP).
-	Virtual connection point: it denotes a connection point which does not have a specific virtual resource representation in the infrastructure; instead, it is typically realized by some form of configuration into one or multiple resources (e.g., external load balancers).
EXAMPLE 1:	Kubernetes® Service is an example of a virtual connection point.
Depending on the type of connection point, additional elements are modelled, such as the virtual link ports and network attachment definition resources to specify the points of attachment to the virtual links.
-	A virtual link port defines the point of attachment of a virtual network interface of a VM-based component of an NF Deployment to a virtual network.
EXAMPLE 2:	An OpenStack® Layer 2 Networking Port is an example of virtual link port.
-	A network attachment definition resource defines the point of attachment of a virtual network interface of an OS-container component of an NF Deployment to a secondary container cluster network.
EXAMPLE 3:	A Network Attachment Definition (NAD) of Multus CNI™ is an example of a network attachment definition resource.
NOTE 2:	Void.
NOTE 3:	The CNI™ Word Mark is a registered trademarks/service marks of The Linux Foundation, in the United States and other countries and are used with the Linux Foundation’s permission.
The virtual connection points and network attachment definition resources are features either specified or referenced by the Release 4 version of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] and primarily concern to OS container-based deployments. There is no need to define connections points for the OS-container components of an NF Deployment that are connected to the primary container cluster network, because the OS-container components are by default connected to such a network when deployed.
As defined in the present document, the API consumer (i.e., SMO) can convey various sets of network protocol information to the DMS to realize various network connectivity patterns. Two cases of connection point provisioning can be realized as supported by the attributes in the "VnfExtCpConfig" data type specified in clause 3.2.6.3.24:
-	The API consumer provisions with the infrastructure management functions in the O-Cloud the connection points in advance and provides subsequently to the DMS references to the virtual link ports or network attachment definition resources that have been provisioned. This case is applicable for both virtual link port-based and network attachment definition resource connectivity.
-	The API consumer provides specific protocol layer information to the DMS, and the DMS subsequently uses such information to provision the virtual link ports or virtual connection points, depending on the type of connection point. This is only applicable for the case of virtual link port-based connectivity and virtual connection points.
Regarding the protocol layer information, the "CpProtocolData" and "CpProtocolInfo" data types defined in clauses 3.2.6.3.25 and 3.2.6.3.13, respectively, represent information about the protocol layer(s) that a connection point uses and the associated protocol information. According to the profiled version of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11], two types of layer protocol types are supported:
-	"IP_OVER_ETHERNET": used to provide network address data for IP over Ethernet.
-	"IP_FOR_VIRTUAL_CP": used to provide network address data for an external connection point realized as a virtual connection point.
For the IP over Ethernet case, additional data types provide the support to define MAC addresses, IP addresses, and types of segmentation and encapsulation, including VLAN ID support. For the IP for virtual connection point, the data types enable the support to assign concrete fixed IP addresses corresponding to the external load balancers associated to the virtual connection point.
2.5.4	Software images information
As described in clause 3.5.1 of O-RAN.WG6.O2-GA&P [4], an O-RAN Cloudified Network Function Software Package is onboarded to further perform software and lifecycle management of O-RAN NF. The NF software package contains software images for the compute resource components of the NF. In the ETSI NFV-based profile, the NF software packaging concept is fulfilled by the "VNF package" artifact.
To instantiate NF Deployments corresponding compute resource components of the NF Deployment have associated software images:
-	in the case of a VM-based NF Deployment: VM software images, and
-	in the case of a container-based NF Deployment, OS container software images.
NOTE 1:	O-Cloud assets are assumed to be conveyed out-of-band because in the present document version, granting exchanges are not specified. ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] defines the "VNF LCM granting interface" as the mechanism to convey such information "in-band".
Regarding the NF Deployment lifecycle management, the onboarding of the software images to the O-Cloud and the transfer of related software image information of the NF Deployment shall be conveyed out-of-band of the O2dms_LifecycleDeployment service API prior to requesting the instantiation of the NF Deployment. The provision of such information is realized in the form of "O-Cloud assets", which are specified in clause 3.2.6.5.5 using the data type "CloudAssets". In the context of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] these are referred as "VIM assets".
VIM assets contain "software image assets" that define the mapping between software images referred in the VNFD (NF Deployment descriptor) and software images managed in the infrastructure resource managers such as the VIM (for VM-based software images) and dedicated repositories such as the CIR (for container-based software images).
NOTE 2:	Void.
OS container software images are features either specified or referenced by the Release 4 version of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] and concern to OS container-based deployments.
2.5.5	Resource management for NF Deployments
NF Deployments are realized by one or multiple instances and types of resources, such as compute, storage and network. In the O2dms ETSI NFV profile, resource handles play a key role in keeping the traceability, inventory and accountability of the resources that are used by an NF Deployment. Resource handles also enable the DMS to manage such resources via the other DMS resource infrastructure functions. The data type providing information about a virtualised resource instance in the infrastructure is named "ResourceHandle" (see clause 3.2.6.3.20). All the constituents of an NF Deployment that have a resource representation in the O-Cloud have an associated resource handle.
A resource handle compiles various types of information, but primarily:
-	An identification of the VIM or CISM connection (interface information and credentials) used to manage the resource.
-	An identification of the resource within the scope of the infrastructure resource provisioning functions.
-	Information about the type of resource within the scope of the infrastructure resource provisioning functions.
-	Additional information about the resource which is specific to the resource and its type and that is made available by the underlying infrastructure resource management functions of the DMS (in the ETSI NFV terminology these are referred as VIM and CISM).
-	Namespace of the resource, in case of a containerized workload resource.
The types of resources composing the NF Deployment differ depending on the deployment form:
-	For VM-based deployments: compute, storage and network resources are realized as "virtual compute" (or VirtualCompute), "virtual storage" (or VirtualStorage) and "virtual network” (or VirtualNetwork).
-	For OS container-based deployments: compute, storage and network resources are modeled as "Compute MCIO", "Storage MCIO" and "Network MCIO". MCIO stands for "Managed Container Infrastructure Object" and it models the objects that are managed and exposed by the container infrastructure services management and represents the desired and actual state of a containerized workload.
EXAMPLE:	In case of a Kubernetes® based implementation of infrastructure resources management functions for OS container-based deployments, examples of "Compute MCIO" are Deployment, Pod, StatefulSet; examples of "Storage MCIO" are: PersistentVolumeClaim; and examples of "Network MCIO" are Ingress, Service. For a full list of mapped Kubernetes® resource objects mapped to MCIOs, refer to ETSI GS NFV-SOL 018 [18].
Resources for NF Deployments are also defined based on the content in the deployment descriptors. In the case of the O2dms ETSI NFV profile, it is assumed that the NF Deployment has a corresponding deployment descriptor that provides requirements and describes the characteristics of the resources necessary for the deployment and lifecycle of the NF Deployment.
NOTE 1:	In the case of the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11], such a descriptor is referred as VNFD. Refer also to the description in table 2.3.2-1 of the present document.
Key characteristics about resources that are of use by the profile are:
-	Deployment descriptors are identified. In the case of VNFD, the attribute is typically named as "vnfdId".
-	Different types of resources can compose an NF Deployment (see also above). As per the present document version, the following are defined based on the classes defined in the "ResourceDefinition" data type (see clause 3.2.6.5.2).
-	COMPUTE: represents a VM-based compute resource.
-	VL: represents a virtual link, which in turns represents a network resource, e.g., virtual network.
-	STORAGE: represents a storage resource.
-	LINKPORT: represents a link port, i.e., a port of attachment to a network.
-	OSCONTAINER: represents an OS container-based compute resource.
-	VIRTUALCP: represents a virtual connection point.
-	Resources have associated resource templates (declarative descriptors). In the case of a VM-based compute resource, the template is further identified by the attribute named "vduId".
-	Allocated resources are identifiable using a corresponding "ResourceHandle".
NOTE 2:	Void.
In the case of OS container-based deployments, additional types defined by the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] are also considered:
-	"McioInfo": it provides information on the MCIO(s) representing the constituents of the NF Deployment that are realized by one or a set of OS containers and that are created using the same declarative descriptor.
As introduced in clause 2.5.1, the "VimConnectionInfo" is used to indicate the type of resource infrastructure management to use as well as the necessary information to enable the consumption of such management.
2.5.6	Acceleration abstraction layer
2.5.6.1	Overview
The O-RAN.WG6.AAL-GAnP.0 [31] introduces the concepts of acceleration abstraction layer (AAL), whose purpose is to specify a common and consistent interface for hardware accelerators to the applications in order to facilitate the decoupling of an application, e.g., an O-RAN NF, from a specific hardware implementation.
In the context of the O2dms ETSI NFV profile and related orchestration procedures, there are three aspects to be considered:
-	The description of acceleration requirements for an NF Deployment,
-	Information exchange between the DMS consumer and the DMS about requested acceleration capabilities for an NF Deployment, and
-	Injecting acceleration-related configuration into the NF Deployment.
Annex A.2 describes examples related to AAL when using the O2dms ETSI NFV profile related specifications.
2.5.6.2	Description of acceleration requirements
NF Deployment descriptors can contain information and requirements about the acceleration capabilities and resources that are needed by an NF Deployment. The descriptors also provide the means for declaring configurable properties, extensions, or additional lifecycle parameters. These can be used to apply configuration related to acceleration capabilities and resources used by the NF Deployment. Figure 2.5.6.2-1 provides a high-level conceptual illustration of the main elements contained in the descriptors, which are summarized as follows:
-	Additional capabilities requirements: description that is used to define requirements the NF Deployment has with respect to additional capabilities, typically, offered by the infrastructure.
-	Placement constraints: description that indicates constraints and requirements regarding the placement rules for the NF Deployment and its constituents.
-	Configurable properties and modifiable attributes: description about configuration parameters and information that can be modified on an NF Deployment.
-	LCM additional parameters: description of parameters that are provided during NF Deployment lifecycle management operations.
These sets of information and relationship with acceleration related aspects are further described in the present and subsequent clauses.
Figure 2.5.6.2-1: Representation of elements in the NF Deployment package which can hold relevant configuration, capabilities, and placement requirements
Regarding the declaration of additional capabilities, in the case of the O2dms ETSI NFV profile and the use of the VNFD as defined in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12], requirements for additional capabilities of compute-related resources are defined as follows:
-	In the case of OS container-based components of an NF Deployment, the "Vdu" information element specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12] includes the "requestAdditionalCapabilities" attribute, which is used to specify requirements for additional capabilities such as acceleration ones.
-	In the case of VM-based components of an NF Deployment, the "VirtualComputeDesc" information element specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12] includes as well a “requestAdditionalCapabilities” attribute, with the same purpose as described in the item above.
Regarding network related resources, the "VirtualNetworkInterfaceRequirements" defined in the NF Deployment unit connection points (referred as "VduCpd" in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12]) and in NF Deployment external connection points (referred as "VnfExtCpd" in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12]) enable the NF designer to indicate standard and additional network interface requirements, e.g., to support SR-IOV or secondary container cluster network interfaces.
NOTE:	The present document version does not specify the source(s) from where requested additional capabilities and virtual network interface requirements can be referenced into the NF Deployment descriptor.
The "RequestedAdditionalCapability" information element in NF Deployment descriptor can be used to describe for each of the components in the NF Deployment the requirements about what AAL profiles and other associated characteristics are needed by the NF Deployment. This can be described on a per deployable unit of the NF Deployment.
In addition, for the concrete case of OS container-based component of an NF Deployment, the "mcioConstraintsParams" in the "Vdu" information element provides parameter names for constraints expected to be assigned to the MCIO realizing the NF Deployment unit. ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 [12] specifies the following MCIO constraint parameter values to express associated semantical constraint context and which are related to acceleration capabilities:
-	"nodeAdditionalCapabilityDpdk": to indicate that the NF Deployment unit needs a cluster node with DPDK driver capability.
-	"nodeAdditionalCapabilitySriov": to indicate that the NF Deployment unit needs a cluster node with SR-IOV card(s).
-	"nodeAdditionalCapabilityGpu": to indicate that the NF Deployment unit needs a cluster node with GPU acceleration device(s).
-	"nodeAdditionalCapabilityFpga": to indicate that the NF Deployment unit needs a cluster node with FPGA device(s).
More information about the relationship between NF Deployment and the concept of MCIO is available in clause 2.5.5.
The use of configurable properties, modifiable attributes, and LCM additional parameters for conveying relevant acceleration configuration information are further described in subsequent clauses.
2.5.6.3	O2dms interface exchanges
AAL LPU requirements for the NF Deployment as well as other deployment constraints and requirements can be provided to the DMS in two forms:
-	On O2dms interface exchanges, and
-	NF Deployment descriptors.
Regarding O2dms interface exchanges, acceleration capabilities and resources information cover the following aspects:
-	MCIO constraints: these are used to provide values assigned to the MCIOs of an NF Deployment that has OS container-based components. This is provided as part of the "ResourcePlacement" data type specified in clause 3.2.6.5.3. The "key" part of the key-value pair of MCIO constraints is defined in the NF Deployment descriptor (see clause 2.5.6.2), while the "value" part of the key-value pair is the actual key-value pair used in the labelling of the O-Cloud Nodes in the O-Cloud Node Cluster.
-	NF Deployment (and units) configurable properties and modifiable attributes: these are used to provide to the DMS runtime configuration and information, e.g., to cater for specific deployment scenarios or state.
-	NF Deployment lifecycle additional parameters: these are used to provide to the DMS additional parameters applicable to the specific lifecycle management operation that is performed for the NF Deployment.
The actual requirements about the AAL profiles that are required by an NF Deployment is part of the NF Deployment descriptors (see previous clause 2.5.6.2). The NF Deployment descriptors are made available to the DMS, either as a pre-condition to initiate the lifecycle operation or during the lifecycle management procedures in which components of an NF Deployment (i.e., NF Deployment units) are created, updated, or terminated.
The O2dms ETSI NFV profile also supports the capability to provide runtime configuration related to acceleration capabilities in case that specific deployment information is expected and is not possible to be determined at design time of the NF Deployment via the corresponding descriptors (refer to items #2 and #3 in the list above). Additional description about these attributes is provided in clause 2.5.6.4.
Processing by the DMS of which concrete instances of LPU to allocate is regarded to be an implementation matter of the DMS. However, the DMS implementation shall be capable to process the expressed requirements provided via the NF Deployment descriptors together with the additional input configuration and information provided via the O2dms interface(s). In addition, DMS shall consider if a pre-selection of AAL resources and O-Cloud Nodes have been determined by the SMO. This information can be made available by the SMO to the DMS using the MCIO constraints based on specific values of O-Cloud Nodes labelling (see also clause 2.5.6.2).
2.5.6.4	Configuring NF Deployments with acceleration related information
2.5.6.4.1	Overview
As described in clause 4.2.2 of O-RAN.WG6.AAL-Common-API [32] and clause 4.1.6 of O-RAN.WG6.AAL-GAnP.0 [31], AAL applications (as part of the NF Deployment) might need certain configuration about the assigned LPUs (e.g., LPU address in the form of a PCI device identification). In case configuration related to acceleration is to be injected into the NF Deployments via lifecycle management procedures, the O2dms ETSI NFV profile provides the following supporting mechanisms:
-	Provisioning configuration data using day-0 mechanisms: in this case, the relevant configuration data is injected during the allocation of the O-Cloud resources and creation of the VM/OS containers realizing the NF Deployment unit.
-	Provisioning configuration data using day-1 mechanisms: in this case, the relevant configuration data is injected after the O-Cloud resource has been allocated and the VM/OS container realizing the NF Deployment unit has been created, but before determining that the NF Deployment is fully operational and ready (i.e., instantiation is completed).
ETSI GR NFV-EVE 022 [33] reports about available VNF configuration mechanisms, and clause 4.2 of ETSI GR NFV-EVE 022 [33] includes descriptions about the meanings of "day-0" and "day-1" configuration in relation to instantiation process of VNF and VNFC instances, which are mapped to NF Deployment and NF Deployment units, respectively, in the present document.
2.5.6.4.2	Day-0 configuration
For day-0 configuration, two mechanisms for providing configuration related to acceleration capabilities to the NF Deployment are defined depending on the form of deployment of the NF Deployment units constituting the NF Deployment:
-	NF Deployment unit based on VM: the "boot data" defined in the NF Deployment descriptor contains strings or URL to files contained in the NF Deployment package that can be used to customize the VM compute resource at boot time. The boot data can contain variable parts that are replaced by deployment specific values during the NF Deployment lifecycle operation before sending the data to the infrastructure manager responsible for creating and setting up the VM.
-	NF Deployment unit based on OS container: the configuration data is declared in the NF Deployment descriptor and in other configuration files within the MCIOPs (e.g., Helm® Charts). The technical realization of the mechanism depends on the container infrastructure management solution. When Kubernetes® and Helm® are used, Helm® Charts can contain values.yaml file(s) with key-value pairs. The DMS can create new values.yaml files to override the value in a key-value pair with the value provided by one or more configurable properties. The key-value pairs in the values.yaml can be used to parameterize Kubernetes® objects such as ConfigMap or Secret, or also be used by Init containers or combinations of commands an arguments declared in the Pod specification manifest.
NOTE:	The mechanism of NF Deployment unit based on OS container can also be used for day-1 configuration.
Day-0 configuration data values related to acceleration capabilities can be provided to the DMS by the SMO according to the O2dms ETSI NFV profile using specific attributes of the "InstantiateVnfRequest" (see clause 5.5.2.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]) and "VnfInfoModificationRequest" (see clause 5.5.2.12 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]). The VNFD, as NF Deployment descriptor, specifies and indicates whether to use one or multiple of the attributes above, and which ones to use. Table 2.5.6.4.2-1 describes the relevant attributes for providing day-0 configuration to NF Deployments.
Table 2.5.6.4.2-1: Interface attributes for providing day-0 configuration to NF Deployments
2.5.6.4.3	Day-1 configuration
For day-1 configuration, the O2dms ETSI NFV profile enables the SMO to provide NF Deployment configuration values using the attributes described in table 2.5.6.4.3-1.
Table 2.5.6.4.3-1: Interface attributes for providing day-1 configuration to NF Deployments
The mechanisms by which the DMS applies the configuration depend on the form of deployment of the relevant NF Deployment units, and these are not "visible" over the interfaces specified in the present O2dms ETSI NFV profile. The mechanisms are regarded to be an implementation or integration matter of the different solutions that constitute an DMS. A description of potential solutions is provided for information purposes:
-	In the case the NF Deployment is realized by VM-based technology and depending on the mechanism that the NF Deployment supports, possible mechanisms are: a) using the "VNF configuration" interface specified by ETSI GS NFV-SOL 002 [29], b) using other standard interfaces based on other protocols such as NETCONF, c) using specific agent-less based configuration tools such as Ansible®.
-	In the case the NF Deployment is realized by OS container-based technology, and depending on the mechanism that the NF Deployment supports, possible mechanisms are: a) using the "VNF configuration" interface specified by ETSI GS NFV-SOL 002 [29], b) using other standard interfaces based on other protocols such as NETCONF, c) using specific agent-less based configuration tools such as Ansible, and in addition, d) using specific mechanisms supported by the container infrastructure management solution such as ConfigMap and Secrets in case of Kubernetes®.

2.5.7	DMS Interactions
2.5.7.1	Overview
As described in clause 2.3.2 and as per the present profile based on "O2-D demarcation #1" (see clause 2.1), the DMS has two main parts:
-	NF Deployment management, and
-	Resource management of NF Deployments, wherein resources can be virtualised resources and containerized workloads.
On the northbound, the DMS exposes the interfaces specified by the present document, which are at the NF Deployment level. Internally, the DMS performs the resources management to fulfil the necessary resources for the NF Deployment. Considering the types of resources (virtual resources and containerized workloads), interactions with other components responsible for the management of these types of resources from the associated O-Cloud Node Clusters, are assumed to take place within the DMS. As described in table 2.3.2-2, according to the ETSI NFV standards, the VIM is the functional block in ETSI NFV responsible for the management of virtualised resources within an O-Cloud Node Cluster, and the CISM the function is responsible for the management of containerized workloads within an O-Cloud Node Cluster.
2.5.7.2	Models in DMS interactions
The present document specifies the protocol and data model of the O2dms interactions. The NF Deployment is the managed object exposed on O2dms, and the models are concerned to such a level of management. As described in clause 2.5.5, NF Deployments are realized by one or multiple instances of types of resources: in VM-based deployment, these are referred as virtualised resources, and for OS container-based deployments, these are referred as MCIOs (but more typically referred as containerized workloads).
The virtualised resources and containerized workloads management parts of the DMS may use specific resources models tailored for the types of resources realizing the NF Deployment. The resources models (indicated by (2) in figure 2.5.7.2-1) can contain information defined at design time of the NF Deployment, but also be complemented by information extracted (coming from) the O2dms interactions based on NF deployment models (indicated by (1) in figure 2.5.7.2-1).
Figure 2.5.7.2-1: Models in interactions
The O2dms NF deployment models comprise two main aspects:
-	NF Deployment design-time information: this is also referred as NF Deployment descriptor, and
-	NF Deployment run-time information and management interfaces: this corresponds to the O2dms ETSI NFV profile modelling specified in the present document.
The resources models can comprise, as well, two main aspects:
-	Resources run-time information and management interfaces: these correspond to interfaces and information provided by the virtualised resources and containerized workloads management parts of the DMS.
-	(Optionally) declarative descriptors for resources management: these can be manifests or templates modelling the actual resources and that can be used to facilitate the interactions towards the resources management functions.
According to the present O2dms ETSI NFV profile, the NF Deployment models provide a generic modelling for managing NF Deployments, irrespective of the types of resources that comprise them. It is a responsibility of the NF Deployment management functions to resolve the necessary resource type specific models. For this, the NF Deployment management functions may, but need not, make use of resources models manifests or templates contained in the O-RAN NF software package.
Figure 2.5.7.2-2 illustrates an overview of the set of models and indicative sets of content in respective descriptors/template/manifests and APIs.
Figure 2.5.7.2-2: Illustration of content in the O2dms and resource management models
Table 2.5.7.2-1 summarizes the relationship between the sets of content in the O2dms and resource management models.
Table 2.5.7.2-1: Relationship between sets of content in the o2dms and resource management models
2.5.8	Monitoring of NF Deployments
2.5.8.1	Overview
NF Deployments are realized by one or multiple instances and types of resources, such as compute, storage, and network. Associated to NF Deployments, as managed objects, performance information and faults can be monitored.
2.5.8.2	Performance monitoring
Performance monitoring is performed via the present O2DMS ETSI NFV profile via the exposure of a corresponding API produced by the DMS, the O2dms_DeploymentPerformance Service API. The monitoring is performed via:
PM Jobs, and
Thresholds.
Collection and reporting of performance information is controlled via PM Jobs.
The performance information is associated to managed object instances, which in the case of the O2DMS, these are the NF Deployments. In addition, sub-object instances can also be further qualified. These are determined depending on the type of metrics that can be monitored from the NF Deployment. For instance, the NF Deployment serves as the main object type, while an NF Deployment unit (aka as VNFC in the case of ETSI NFV) is a kind of sub-object that is part of an NF Deployment. A consumer, such as the SMO, can learn about the managed objects, such as the NF Deployment, via the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service.
Performance metrics associated to VNF instances, and consequently to NF Deployments (as per the current profile) are specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 027 [34].
2.5.8.3	Fault monitoring
Fault monitoring is performed via the present O2DMS ETSI NFV profile via the exposure of a corresponding API produced by the DMS, the O2dms_DeploymentFault Service API. The monitoring is performed via Alarms, which are raised to provide information about faults and failures associated to the managed objects of concern.
Like in the case of performance monitoring, NF Deployment serves as the main object type, while other sub-objects are also identified to which specific fault information can be associated. A consumer, such as the SMO, can learn about the managed objects, such as the NF Deployment, via the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service.
Standard alarms associated to VNF instances, and consequently to NF Deployments (as per the current profile) are specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 045 [35].
3	API definitions
3.1	General aspects
3.1.1	Introduction
The present document defines the protocol and data model for the following O2dms service interfaces in the form of RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) specifications:
O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API (as produced by the DMS towards the SMO).
O2dms_DeploymentFault Service API (as produced by the DMS towards the SMO).
O2dms_DeploymentPerformance Service API (as produced by the DMS towards the SMO).
NOTE:	Other service APIs are expected to be defined in future versions of the present document.
Table 3.1.1-1 lists the versions of the APIs defined in the present document.
Table 3.1.1-1: Versions of the APIs specified in the present document
In clause 3, general aspects are specified that apply to multiple APIs for O2dms services. In addition, the provisions in clauses 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.1.5, 3.1.6, 3.1.7, and 3.1.8 define common aspects of RESTful APIs, and shall apply for all APIs defined in the present document.
In the subsequent clauses, the protocol and data model for the individual interfaces are specified. Per interface, the resource structure with associated HTTP methods is defined and applicable flows are provided, if necessary. Further, the resources and the data model are specified in detail.
Even though the different interfaces defined in the present document are related, implementations shall not assume a particular order of messages that arrive via different interfaces.
3.1.2	URI structure and supported content formats
This clause specifies the URI prefix and the supported formats applicable to the O2dms RESTful APIs based on the ETSI NFV profile.
All resource URIs of the APIs shall have the following prefix, except the "API versions" resource which shall follow the rules specified in clause 9.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15]:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API service consumer towards the API service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause 4.1 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15] and further qualified as follows:
{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiMajorVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>
with the following components:
-	The {apiRoot} indicates the scheme ("https"), the host name and optional port, and an optional sequence of path segments that together represent a prefix path,
-	The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. The {apiName} of each interface is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding O2dms RESTful API,
-	The <apiMajorVersion> indicates the current major version of the API and is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding O2dms RESTful API, and
-	The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> indicates a resource URI of the API, and shall be set as described in the corresponding O2dms RESTful API for each one of the defined resources.
HTTP/1.1, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [24], shall be used. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as specified in IETF RFC 793 [20] shall be used as transport protocol for HTTP/1.1.
For HTTP requests and responses that have a body, the content format JSON (see IETF RFC 8259 [25]) shall be supported. The JSON format shall be signalled by the content type "application/json".
All APIs shall support and use HTTP over TLS (also known as HTTPS) (see IETF RFC 2818 [Error! Reference source not found.]). All APIs shall use TLS version 1.2 as defined by IETF RFC 5246 [23] or later.
NOTE 1:	The HTTP protocol elements mentioned in the O2dms RESTful APIs originate from the HTTP specification; HTTPS runs the HTTP protocol on top of a TLS layer. For simplicity, the O2dms RESTful APIs specifications therefore use the statement above to mention "HTTP request", "HTTP header", etc., without explicitly calling out HTTPS.
NOTE 2:	There are a number of best practices and guidelines how to configure and implement TLS 1.2 in a secure manner, as security threats evolve. A detailed specification of those is beyond the scope of the present document; the reader is referred to external documentation such as annex E of ETSI TS 133 310 [Error! Reference source not found.].
All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [Error! Reference source not found.]. An implementation that dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of path segments that are separated by "/", query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the character set that is allowed by IETF RFC 3986 [22] for these parts.
NOTE 3:	This means that characters not part of this allowed set are escaped using percent-encoding as defined by IETF RFC 3986 [22].
Unless otherwise specified explicitly, all request URI parameters that are part of the path of the resource URI shall be individual path segments, i.e., shall not contain the "/" character.
NOTE 4:	A request URI parameter is denoted by a string in curly brackets, e.g. {fooId}.
3.1.3	Usage of HTTP header fields
3.1.3.1	General
HTTP headers are components of the header section of the HTTP request and response messages. They contain the information about the server/client and metadata of the transaction. The use of HTTP header fields shall comply with the provisions defined for those header fields in the specifications referenced from tables 3.1.3.2-1 and 3.1.3.3-1. The following clauses describe more details related to selected HTTP header fields.
3.1.3.2	Request header fields
The request header fields that shall be supported by O2dms RESTful APIs are as specified in clause 4.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2dms RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
3.1.3.3	Response header fields
The response header fields that shall be supported by O2dms RESTful APIs are as specified in clause 4.2.3 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2dms RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
3.1.4	Result set control
3.1.4.1	Introduction
This clause specifies procedures that allow to control the size of the result set of GET requests w.r.t. the number of entries in a response list (using attribute-based filtering) or w.r.t. the number of attributes returned in a response (using attribute selection).
3.1.4.2	Attribute-based filtering and selector
The use of attribute-based filtering shall be supported by O2dms RESTful APIs as specified in clause 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2dms RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.
3.1.4.3	Handling of large query results
The handling of large query results shall be supported by O2dms RESTful APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15].
3.1.5	Error reporting
In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is generally not enough to discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error information is typically delivered.
The error reporting shall be supported by O2dms RESTful APIs as specified in clause 6 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15].
NOTE:	ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [15] refers to "RESTful NFV-MANO API" specification; and wherever such reference is provided "O2dms RESTful API" is to be considered instead for the purpose of the present document.

3.2	O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API
3.2.1	Description
This service interface enables an API consumer (e.g., the SMO) to invoke lifecycle management operations of NF Deployments towards the DMS. The service interface also enables the management of subscriptions to notifications raised by the DMS regarding the lifecycle of the NF Deployments.
3.2.2	API version
For the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API version as specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be "2", the MINOR version field shall be "10", and the PATCH version field shall be "0" as specified in clause 5.1a of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. Consequently, the {apiMajorVersion} URI variable shall be set to "v2".
3.2.3	REST resources structure and methods
All resource URIs of the API shall use the base URI specified defined in clause 3.1.2. The string "vnflcm" shall be used to represent {apiName} as defined in clause 5.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. All resource URIs in clauses below are defined relative to the formed based URI (i.e., {apiRoot}/xyz/{apiVersion}).
When ambiguity is possible, the term REST resource is used to make the distinction between the term resource as understood within the context of REST API from the term resource as understood within the context of O-RAN.
The resource URI structure defined for the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API shall be as specified in clause 5.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11]. Applicable individual REST resources for the present version of the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API are listed in table 3.2.3-1.
Figure 3.2.3-1 illustrates the overall resource URI structure defined for the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API.
Figure 3.2.3-1: Resource URI structure of the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API
Table 3.2.3-1 lists the individual REST resources defined and the applicable HTTP methods. The DMS shall support responding to requests for all HTTP methods on the resources in table 3.2.3-1 that are marked as "M" (mandatory) in the "Cat" column.
Table 3.2.3-1: Resources and methods overview
3.2.4	REST resources
3.2.4.1	General
The DMS and API consumer of the O2dms_DeploymentLifecycle Service API shall support all the provisions specified in clause 5.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11], with the following considerations:
-	NFVO and VNFM entities referred in the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] are mapped to SMO and DMS as defined in clause 2.3.2 of the present document.
-	VNF and VNFC referred in the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] are mapped to NF Deployment and NF Deployment unit as defined in clause 2.3.2 of the present document.
-	Only the provisions associated to corresponding REST resources and methods listed in table 3.2.3-1 are applicable for the present document. That is, if a REST resource and method is not listed in table 3.2.3-1 of the present document, the corresponding clause in the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] that specifies such REST resource, and its supported methods, is not required to be supported according to the present document version. If specific provisions to REST resources are considered with respect to the profiled API, these are specified in subsequent sub-clauses within clause 3.2.4 of the present document.

Clause 5.6.1 in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 [11] describes basic concepts for error handling to be considered during lifecycle management operation occurrences. The same clause also describes what are common failure resolution strategies and the concepts of retry and rollback of lifecycle management operations. In the descriptions, references to the NFV-MANO functional blocks are provided (e.g., NFVO and VNFM), while in the present profile document, the corresponding O-RAN framework elements are to be considered instead according to the mappings in clause 2.3.2 and the specification in clause 3.2.4.1.
3.2.7.2.2	States and state transitions of lifecycle management operation occurrences of NF Deployments

-	The provisions and descriptions related to "obtaining the grant" need not be supported.
NOTE:	Granting exchanges between DMS and SMO are not supported in the present document version. Refer also to the conditions described in clause 3.2.4.1.
Based on the above, specific states as supported by the present document version have the following characteristics.
A) about states:
-	STARTING:
*	The VNF lifecycle management operation occurrence of the NF Deployment shall transit into the PROCESSING state once the DMS has checked that a) resources management fulfillment information (without performing a granting exchange), b) placement information, and c) deployment items of the NF Deployment are available to the DMS. The items a), b) and c) in the previous listing are hereafter referred as "NF Deployment lifecycle items"
*	If an error occurs during the checking steps, or the DMS does not have the necessary information to proceed with the infrastructure resources fulfillment for the NF Deployment, the lifecycle management operation occurrence of the NF Deployment shall transit into the "ROLLED_BACK" state.
-	FAILED_TEMP:
*	If "NF Deployment lifecycle items" for the lifecycle operation were available, these are still valid.
B) about error handling operations:
-	Retry:
*	The "Retry" shall operate within the bounds of the "NF Deployment lifecycle items" information available to the DMS.
-	Rollback:
*	The "Rollback" shall operate within the bounds of the "NF Deployment lifecycle items" information available to the DMS.

Annex A (Informative): Examples
A.1	Overview
Annex A describes examples of usage of the O2dms ETSI NFV profile on various aspects.
A.2	AAL examples
A.2.1	Example #1: Definition of acceleration capability requirements in NF Deployment descriptors
The following example illustrates how the NF Deployment descriptor based on ETSI NFV’s VNFD, in particular based on TOSCA according to ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10], can declare acceleration requirements for a VM-based NF Deployment unit by leveraging the definition of the requested additional capabilities. The example describes the use of the requested additional capabilities and the reference to AAL-related key-value.
NOTE 1:	The example is not meant to be accurate in terms of necessary AAL parameterization (e.g., the requested capability name, values of "requested_additional_capability_name", version parameters, "profile_type" and "other_profile_params" in the example are just indicative) and its purpose is only to indicate the "placeholder" for such information in the VNFD. The example can be revisited in future versions of the present document based on the progress made in referenced O-RAN WG6 AAL specifications.
NOTE 2:	The example only focuses on specific parts of the NF Deployment descriptors.
In the example above:
-	In red, the modelling concerns only to the choice of TOSCA as NF Deployment descriptor according to ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10] and does not concern to modelling of AAL information or requirements. In other words, the red parts show how the NF designer models the capability within the descriptor by following the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10] specification.
-	In blue, the modelling concerns to AAL and what is (expected) to be specified by O-RAN. The O-Cloud is expected to be provisioned with such a capability in order for the NF Deployment to be successful. The values here are only an example. The possible values and parameters names ("profile_type", version number, "other_profile_params") are assumed to be referenced from O-RAN specification.
-	In black, these are other parts that do not concern specifically to AAL and are only depicted for completeness of the example.
A.2.2	Example #2: Definition of acceleration related configuration in NF Deployment descriptors and exchange of information on the O2dms interfaces
The following example illustrates how the NF Deployment descriptor based on ETSI NFV’s VNFD, in particular based on TOSCA according to ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10], can declare configurable properties that can be used for providing runtime configuration information into boot data to be injected into a VM-based NF Deployment unit.
NOTE 1:	The example is not meant to be accurate in terms of necessary AAL parameterization and its purpose is only to indicate the "placeholder" for such information in the VNFD. The example can be revisited in future versions of the present document based on the progress made in referenced O-RAN WG6 AAL specifications.
NOTE 2:	The example only focuses on specific parts of the NF Deployment descriptors.
In the example above:
-	In red, the modelling concerns only to the choice of TOSCA as NF Deployment descriptor according to ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10] and does not concern to modelling of AAL information or requirements. In other words, the red parts show how the NF designer models the capability within the descriptor by following the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10] specification.
-	In blue, the modelling concerns to AAL and what is (expected) to be specified by O-RAN regarding relevant AAL configuration parameters. The values here are only an example. The possible values and parameters names ("profile_type", version number, "other_profile_params") are assumed to be referenced from O-RAN specification or simply referenced from the respective O-RAN specification by the ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10].
-	In black, these are other parts that do not concern specifically to AAL and are only depicted for completeness of the example.
It is to be noted that MyExample.datatypes.nfv.VnfInstantiateAdditionalParameters and MyExample.datatypes.nfv.AdditionalVnfConfigurableProperties are datatypes defined by the NF designer and not further specified by ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [10]. However, from an O-RAN standpoint, standard parameters related to AAL might be defined.
A.2.3	Example #3: Exchange of information on the O2dms interfaces related to acceleration
Based on the example described in clause A.2.2, the following related example illustrates how the runtime configuration data can be provided by the SMO to the DMS as part of content message data during the NF Deployment instantiation request.
