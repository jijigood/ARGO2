Foreword

 This Technical Report (TR) has been produced by O-RAN Alliance.

Modal verbs terminology

In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions).

"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.

1	Scope

The technical report defines the authorization framework for O-RAN elements using OAuth 2.0 and applies to the HTTP and Kafka based APIs [i.13] [i.18] used in the R1, O1, O2, A1, FH m-plane [i.17] and Y1 interfaces.

For this objective, the present document

Defines the procedure flow for token registration process, token request process, token verification process and token authorization process. It will specify the token scope metadata for O-RAN.

Analyses the existing specifications related to OAuth 2.0 such as O-RAN Security protocol specification, IETF RFC 8705 [i.6], IETF RFC 6749 [i.5], 3GPP TS29.501 [i.3], 3GPP TS 33.122 [i.4], 3GPP TS 28.319 [i.19] and ETSI NFV SEC-022 [i.7]. This is used as input to the present document.

Analyses the security threat arising from the misuse of the access token and defines the security requirements associated to access token.

Provides the study and recommendation of an authorization server architecture to overlay on the O-RAN architecture.

1.1 	Consideration

This Technical Report makes the following considerations:

O-RAN Alliance WG1 has identified the key functions and interfaces [i.9] adopted in O-RAN and this will influence the set of assets to be protected for OAuth 2.0 framework.

This TR will perform a detailed study of the OAuth 2.0 authorization server for O-RAN Architecture Elements and interface.

Clause 4.7 in O-RAN Security Protocol Security specification [i.1] will be considered as the baseline text for the OAuth 2.0 framework.

The recommended security requirements and controls provided in this report will be shared with the impacted O-RAN Alliance working group, such as WG1, WG2, WG3, WG6 and WG10 prior publishing them as normative.

3	Definition of terms, symbols and abbreviations

3.1	Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms apply:

A1: Interface between non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC to enable policy-driven guidance of Near-RT RIC applications/functions, and support AI/ML workflow.

Access Token: credentials used to obtain access. It is a string, usually opaque to the client, representing an authorization issued to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server (see [i.5], clause 1.4).

Authorization code: The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its user-agent as defined in [IETF RFC 2616]), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code. ([i.5], clause 1.3.1)

Authorization Server: The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. ([i.5], clause 1.1)

Client: An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization. The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices). ([i.5], clause 1.1)

Client Credentials: The client credentials (or other forms of client authentication) can be used as an authorization grant when the authorization scope is limited to the protected resources under the control of the client, or to protected resources previously arranged with the authorization server.  Client credentials are used as an authorization grant typically when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner) or is requesting access to protected resources based on an authorization previously arranged with the authorization server. ([i.5], clause 1.3.4)

Confidential client:  A client capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means as in clause 2.1 of [i.5].

CSRF: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a web-based attack whereby HTTP requests are transmitted from a user that the web site trusts or has authenticated (e.g., via HTTP redirects or HTML forms). ([i.8], clause 4.4.1.8)

Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller: An O-RAN Network Function (NF) that enables near-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained data collection and actions over E2 interface. It may include AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning) workflow including model training, inference and updates.

Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller: A functionality within SMO that drives the content carried across the A1 interface.  It is comprised of the Non-RT RIC Framework and the Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps) whose services are defined below.

Non-RT RIC Applications (rApps): Modular applications that leverage the functionality exposed via the Non-RT RIC Framework’s R1 interface to provide added value services relative to RAN operation, such as driving the A1 interface, recommending values and actions that may be subsequently applied over the O1/O2 interface and generating “enrichment information” for the use of other rApps.  The rApp functionality within the Non-RT RIC enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources and policy-based guidance to the applications/features in Near-RT RIC.

O2: Interface between SMO framework as specified in clause 5.3.1 and the O-Cloud for supporting O-RAN virtual network functions. Please refer to [i.9] for more information.

Open Redirector: An open redirector is an endpoint using a parameter to automatically redirect a user-agent to the location specified by the parameter value without any validation. ([i.5], clause 10.15)

R1 Interface: Interface between rApps and Non-RT RIC Framework via which R1 Services can be produced and consumed.

Refresh token: Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner). ([i.5], clause 1.5)

	Resource Owner: An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user. ([i.5], clause 1.1)

Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. ([i.5], clause 1.1)

SMO: A Service Management and Orchestration framework.

User-Agent: The User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes, the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations. ([i.12], clause 14.43)

xApp: An application designed to run on the Near-RT RIC. Such an application is likely to consist of one or more microservices and at the point of on-boarding will identify which data it consumes and which data it provides. The application is independent of the Near-RT RIC and may be provided by any third party. The E2 enables a direct association between the xApp and the RAN functionality.

Y1: An interface over which RAN analytics services are exposed by the Near-RT RIC to be consumed by Y1 consumers.

Figure 9.1-1 OAuth 2.0 framework for O-RAN Architecture elements and applications

 O-RAN OAuth 2.0 framework defines four roles from clause 1 of IETF RFC 6749 [i.5]:

O-RAN client: An O-RAN client is an O-RAN Architecture Element or Application like an rApp or xApp acting as an OAuth client.

Authorization server: The server issuing access tokens to the O-RAN client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

Resource owner: “An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.” ([i.5], clause 1.1)

Resource server: “The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.” ([i.5], clause 1.1)

 9.3.1.3	      Impacts on Existing O-RAN Architecture Elements and Interfaces

R1 interface, rApp and SME are the O-RAN architecture elements and interfaces involved in the proposed use cases as specified in Decoupled SMO [i.15] [i.16].

1)	Service Management and Exposure (SME) SMOS

The SME service is introduced in the [i.8] clause 3.1. While the SME was initially targeted for management and exposure of rApp services in the [i.8], its services are applicable to any entities within the SMO that fulfil the roles of Service Producer and/or Service Consumer.

In a decomposed service-based SMO architecture, the SME can be leveraged as a generic SMOS, handling service management and exposure for any SMOSs within SMO. The SME SMOS provides a set of common SMO capabilities that are needed for all SMO Services.

Several of the SME services are applicable to any SMOSs:

SMOS registration,

SMOS discovery,

Authentication and authorization to access a SMOS,

Communication support between SMOS Service Producers and SMOS Service Consumers (SMOS Communication),

Bootstrap of new SMOSs (optional),

Heartbeat of SMOSs (optional).

rApp Management (SMOS)

The rApp management service handles management aspects specific to rApps such as:

rApp Configuration Management (CM): enables management of the rApp configuration settings,

rApp Performance Management (PM): offers support for performance reporting on an rApp performance, or of the rApp communication with the non-RT RIC framework (rApp usage of R1 interface),

rApp Fault Management (FM): provides the fault reporting capabilities to rApps, so they can consume it to report faults that are related to the rApp, or to the rApp communication with the non-RT RIC framework (rApp usage of R1 interface),

rApp Logging Information: enables rApps to convey their logging information to the non-RT RIC framework,

rApp lifecycle management services, that expose services that allow to trigger rApp software lifecycle management.

9.3.3.3	        Impacts on Existing O-RAN Architecture Elements and Interfaces

R1 interface, rApp and SME are the O-RAN architecture elements and interfaces involved in the proposed use cases as specified in Decoupled SMO [i.15] [i.16].

1)	Service Management and Exposure (SME) SMOS

 The SME service is introduced in the [i.13] clause 3.1. While the SME was initially targeted for management and exposure of rApp services in the [i.13], its services are applicable to any entities within the SMO that fulfil the roles of Service Producer and/or Service Consumer.

In a decomposed service-based SMO architecture, the SME can be leveraged as a generic SMOS, handling service management and exposure for any SMOSs within SMO. The SME SMOS provides a set of common SMO capabilities that are needed for all SMO Services.

Several of the SME services are applicable to any SMOSs:

SMOS registration,

SMOS discovery,

Authentication and authorization to access a SMOS,

Communication support between SMOS Service Producers and SMOS Service Consumers (SMOS Communication),

Bootstrap of new SMOSs (optional),

Heartbeat of SMOSs (optional).

SME in the role of SME services Producer

supports the functionality of OAuth 2.0 authorization server,

support authentication and authorization of an rApp to determine which R1 services an rApp can access,

provide response of success or failure to access token request

rApp

initiating the procedure to request access token,

initiating service request with the available access token.

R1 Service Producer

provider of an R1 service.

9.3.3.4          Solution Evaluation

Key issue #6: Provisioning of service access based on access token

     Potential Security Recommendations

Use OAuth 2.0, as specified in O-RAN Security Protocols Specifications [i.1], clause 4.7 to implement authorization in the R1 interface.

Enable the SME to act as both an OAuth 2.0 resource and an OAuth 2.0 authorization server.

9.3.4           Solution #4: Secure transmission of request and response between client to authorization server, between client and resource server for R1, A1 and O2

9.3.4.1         Background

This solution elaborates on the possibilities to ensure that data for the below flows is secure during transmission,

Between client and authorization server

The client needs to send the credentials and the authorization request details which need to be secured during transmission.

Between client and resource server

The client needs to send the access token to the authentic resource server which needs to be secured during transmission.

Tls_client_auth

RFC 8705 [i.6]

Usage of certificates for both client and server authentication. Usage of certificate hash for certificate bound access tokens

Private_key_JWT (with JWE)

RFC 8705 [i.6]

Usage of certificates for both integrity and confidentiality protection (encryption)

Private_key_JWT

OpenID foundation [i.21]

Usage of certificates for integrity protection

Client_secret_JWT

OpenID foundation [i.21]

Usage of shared secret for example client_secret for integrity protection

Client_secret_basic

RFC 7591 [i.22]

Client_id and client_secret transmission in the header

Client_secret_post

RFC 7591 [i.22]

Client_id and client_secret transmission in the payload

Self_signed_tls_client_auth

RFC 8705 [i.6]

Usage of client side self signed certificates in mutual authentication

Below are the details of the methods explained above

Tls_client_auth

Part of RFC 8705

Mutual authentication of both client and server. Here certificates are issued by a certificate authority. Also supports token binding.

For certificate bound access tokens every party proves that they are in possession of their private key.

Who is in possession of the private key used to establish the connection can use the access token (puts the hash of the certificate (cnf) that has been used)

Figure 9.3.4-3 - Tls_client_OAuth method

Private_key_JWT (with JWE)

Part of OpenID foundation specification

Public and private key is used to sign and encrypt the JWT token using asymmetric cryptography.

Contents of the message cannot be seen as they are encrypted

Figure 9.3.4-4 Private_key_JWT with JWE method

Private_key_JWT

Part of OpenID foundation specification

The client_id and client_secret is part of the JWT token which is integrity protected. The JWT is a string which is attached as a client assertion. Here we AVOID putting the secret in message, instead in the JWT token.

Confidential client create JSON Web Token along with the public and private key. Hence structure of the JWT isthe header, body and the Signature. Hence JWS client has the private key and shares the public key to the authorization server for validation of the request. Hence the contents of the message can be seen but secure from manipulation.

Figure 9.3.4-5 Private_key_JWT method

Client_secret_JWT

Part of OpenID foundation specification

Client_secret_JWT - client_id and client_secret in the JWT token which is integrity protected with a shared secret key (client_secret known to both parties) using HMAC. The JWT is a string which is attached as a client assertion. Here we AVOID putting the secret in message. Instead in the JWT token which is with a MAC (hash function+Secret)

9.3.4.3	        Impacts on Existing O-RAN Architecture Elements and Interfaces

R1 client, A1 client and the O2 client needs to choose the authentication method from the options explained above depending on the client and authorization server capabilities:

9.3.4.4	        Solution Evaluation

There is a need to support secure transmission of request and response between client and authorization server, between client to resource server.

9.3.5           Solution #5: Support for RBAC

9.3.5.1         Background

		 Role based access control is an important concept for the authorization mechanism in O-RAN to support either coarse grained or fine-grained access.

		 The protected resources expose various operations which can be protected by access rules are mapped to different roles in an operator setup. An operator should assign roles to users (human and non-human) using identity management workflows.

This solution elaborates on the possibilities to

		Explain the association between the users, roles and the access rules (permissions) as defined in [i.19] clause 7.

	NOTE: the reference of the 3GPP specification in [i.19] can be considered as an example and customised for the O-RAN interfaces.

Figure 9.3.5-1 RBAC for client credentials

9.3.5.3	        Impacts on Existing O-RAN Architecture Elements and Interfaces

The O-RAN interfaces should factor in the permissions which should be used in the context of scope in the OAuth flows.

The keyword scope is used both in an OAuth access token as well as in the OpenAPI to define what a particular interface is allowed to do.

9.3.5.4	        Solution Evaluation

Permissions have to be considered by all the O-RAN APIs,

For the OpenAPIs this should be expressed as scopes,

The semantics of the permissions which should be evaluated and validated by the resource server need to be defined.

	This solution considers the below aspects for the profile,

Resource server which exposes the APIs.

Authorization server client (confidential client). Example of confidential client is A1 client interacting with the Near RT RIC platform.

9.3.6.3	        Impacts on Existing O-RAN Architecture Elements and Interfaces

      Impacts to be considered with respect to the following:

Resource servers

O-RAN related APIs to define the scopes

Authorization server

The OAuth servers should support the following capabilities

Token end points support

Introspection end point

Tokens with reference to access rules

Access token lifetime

Re-authenticate or refresh tokens

Solution options:

RBAC deployment

Client (confidential client)

O-RAN related client credentials grant type clients ( e.g., xApps) should be capable making a client credential grant request, processing of response and forwarding the access token in an API call.

Security options

O-RAN related http interfaces should support mTLS with certificate binding in [i.6].
