Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations

3.1	Terms

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms apply:

Non-RT RIC: O-RAN non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller: a logical function in the SMO framework that enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources, AI/ML workflow including model training and updates, and policy-based guidance of applications/features in Near-RT RIC. The Non-RT RIC is comprised of the Non-RT RIC framework and Non-RT RIC applications (rApps).

Non-RT RIC framework: Functionality internal to the SMO framework that logically terminates the A1 interface and provides the R1services to rApps through the R1 interface.

rApp: Non-RT RIC application: an application designed to consume and/or produce R1 Services.

 NOTE: 	rApps can leverage the functionality provided by the SMO/Non-RT RIC framework to deliver value added services related to intelligent RAN optimization and operation.

DME type: data type managed and exposed by the DME services and identified by a data type identifier.

6.1.5	Required data.

For registering, an rApp needs to provide the security credentials along with e.g., rApp name, vendor, software version, certificates etc. and the role an rApp is trying to register (Service Producer and/or Service Consumer).

The response to the rApp registration includes the status of registration i.e., success or failure.

For successful rApp registration, the response will also include the rAppId.

For unsuccessful rApp registration, the response will also include the error code along with relevant information.

The rApp may obtain information about the SME services endpoints from the producer of bootstrap service.

6.2	SME Use case 2: Manage Service Registration

6.2.1	Overview

This use case allows an rApp as Service Producer to register each of its produced services, update the service information of each of its registered services and deregister each of its registered service as specified in R1GAP[1].

6.2.2	Background and goal of the use case

An rApp as a Service Producer can register each of the new services its producers. Other rApps that are Service Consumers can discover the registered services.

After an rApp as a Service Producer has successfully registered the each of the services it produces, it can update and/or deregister each of the registered services.

6.2.3	Entities/resources involved in the use case.

SME functions in the role of SME services Producer

support functionality to register a service produced by an rApp,

support authorization of an rApp to determine whether an rApp can register a service, update a registered service, and deregister a registered service,

support validation of the new service produced by an rApp that includes determining whether there are conflicts with services registered earlier,

provide the response of success or failure result to Register service request, Update service registration request and Deregister service request.

rApp

supports to initiate the procedure to register a service it produces, update a registered service, and deregister a registered service.

The DME type information includes the data type identifier, metadata describing the DME type, the schemas for the data content, and constraints for how data can be produced, delivered, and accessed.

For registering a DME type, the rApp provides the rAppId and DME type information. On successful registration, Data management and exposure functions provide a DME type registration identifier for the registration of the rApp as producer of data for the DME type.

For querying a DME type registration, the rApp provides the rAppId and DME type registration identifier.

For updating a DME type registration, the rApp provides the rAppId, DME type registration identifier and DME type registration update information.

For deregistering a DME type, the rApp provides the rAppId and the DME type registration identifier.

NOTE: 	Data management and exposure functions are not required to check whether the rApp is not producing any data for the DME type it tries to deregister.

To receive notifications regarding changes in status change of an A1 policy, the rApp as A1 policy service Consumer subscribes to notifications by providing rAppId and A1 policy identifier. When the A1 policy functions have successfully processed the request, they respond by providing a subscription identifier.

The A1 policy functions send notifications to the subscribed rApp when there are changes in status changes of the A1 policy by providing subscription identifier, and information about the changes (i.e., A1 policy status becomes enforced or not enforced).

For unsubscribing from notifications, a subscribed rApp needs to provide the rAppId and subscription identifier.
