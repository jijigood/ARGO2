3	Definitions and Abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply.
A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
A1: Interface between non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC to enable policy-driven guidance of Near-RT RIC applications/functions, and support AI/ML workflow [4].
E2: Interface connecting the Near-RT RIC and one or more O-CU-CPs, one or more O-CU-UPs, and one or more O-DUs [2].

-	for NR access: O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU or any combination as defined in [9];
-	for E-UTRA access: O-eNB.
non-RT RIC (O-RAN non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller): a logical function that enables non-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources, AI/ML workflow including model training and updates, and policy-based guidance of applications/features in Near-RT RIC.
Near-RT RIC (O-RAN near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller): a logical function that enables near-real-time control and optimization of RAN elements and resources via fine-grained (e.g. UE basis, Cell basis) data collection and actions over E2 interface.

4	General
4.1	Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed.
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed.
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see clause 10.
4.2	Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
4.4	Identifiers
For the purposes of the present document, the following identifiers apply:
E2 Node Component ID: Local identifier used to uniquely identify an E2 Node component.
Global E2 Node ID: Global identifier of an E2 Node.  Defined as the global eNB or gNB identifier and an optional local identifier of an CU-UP or DU which is required when and if an individual DU or CU-UP supports a direct E2 interface.
Global RIC ID: Global identifier of a Near-RT RIC.
RAN Function ID: Local identifier of a specific RAN Function within an E2 Node that supports one or more RIC Services using a specific E2 Service Model.  Note that same E2SM may be used by more than one RAN Function in the same E2 Node.
RAN Function OID: RAN Function Object Identifier.  Used to identify specific RAN function definition (i.e. E2SM used by specific RAN Function).
RIC Action ID: Local identifier used Near-RT RIC to identify a specific Action within a specific RIC Subscription Request, used by E2 Node in subsequent RIC Indication messages.
RIC Call Process ID: Local identifier used by E2 Node to identify the suspended associated procedure instance during a RIC Service “Insert”, used by Near-RT RIC in subsequent RIC Control procedure.
RIC Request ID: Local identifier used to identify a specific RIC Functional procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same protocol peer.  Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same RIC Request ID. The RIC Request ID is determined by the initiating peer of a Near-RT RIC Functional Procedure.
-	RIC Control procedure shall carry a unique RIC Request ID assigned by the Near-RT RIC
-	RIC Subscription procedure shall carry a unique RIC Request ID assigned by the Near-RT RIC
-	RIC Indication, RIC Subscription Delete and RIC Subscription Delete Required procedures shall use the same RIC Request ID as the corresponding RIC Subscription procedure
Transaction ID: Local identifier used to uniquely identify a Global Procedure among all ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same protocol peer.  Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same Transaction ID. The Transaction ID is determined by the initiating peer of a Global Procedure (Near-RT RIC or E2 Node).
5	E2AP Services
The present clause describes the services an E2 Node offers to the Near-RT RIC.
5.1	E2AP procedure modules
The E2 interface E2AP procedures are divided into two modules as follows:
1.	E2AP Near-RT RIC Functional Procedures;
2.	E2AP Global Procedures;
The E2AP Near-RT RIC functional procedures module contains procedures used to pass application specific messages between Near-RT RIC applications and a target function in an E2 node [2]
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not directly related to a specific application.
5.2	Parallel transactions
Parallel transactions, that is, multiple ongoing E2AP procedures related to the same Application and E2 node, are supported.
6	Services expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of E2AP messages. E2AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
7	Functions of E2AP
The functions of E2AP are described in O-RAN Working Group 3 Near-Real-time RAN Intelligent Controller, E2 General Aspects and Principles [2].
8	E2AP Procedures
8.1	Elementary Procedures
In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 EPs.

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Near-RT RIC Subscription procedure, successful operation
The Near-RT RIC initiates the procedure by sending the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing a unique RIC Request ID IE, assigned by the Near-RT RIC, to the target E2 Node. When the Near-RT RIC sends the RIC SUBSCRIPTION message, it shall start the timer TRICEVENTcreate.
At reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message the target E2 Node shall:
-	Determine the target function using the information in the RAN Function ID IE and configure the requested event trigger using information in the RIC Subscription Details IE.
-	If one or more Report, Insert and/or Policy RIC service actions are included in the RIC Subscription Details IE then the target function shall validate the event trigger and requested action sequence and, if accepted, store the required RIC Request ID, RIC Event Trigger Definition IE and sequence of RIC Action ID IE, RIC Action Type IE, RIC Action Definition IE, if included, and RIC Subsequent Action IE, if included.
If the requested trigger and at least one required action are accepted by the target E2 Node, the target E2 Node shall reserve necessary resources and send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message back to the Near-RT RIC. The target E2 Node shall include in the response message the actions for which resources have been prepared at the target E2 Node in the RIC Actions Admitted List IE. The target E2 Node shall include the actions that have not been admitted in the RIC Actions Not Admitted List IE with an appropriate cause value.
Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE message the Near-RT RIC shall stop the timer TRICEVENTcreate and terminate the Subscription Request procedure.

If the target E2 Node does not admit at least one requested action, or detects an inconsistency in the sequence of actions or in the subsequent action definitions, or a failure occurs during the RIC Subscription procedure, the target E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC with an appropriate cause value.
Upon reception of the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message the Near-RT RIC shall stop the timer TRICEVENTcreate and terminate the RIC Subscription procedure.
Interactions with RIC Subscription Delete procedure:
If there is no response from the target E2 Node to the RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message before the timer TRICEVENTcreate expires in the Near-RT RIC, the Near-RT RIC shall cancel the RIC Subscription towards the target E2 Node by initiating the RIC Subscription Delete procedure with an appropriate cause value. The Near-RT RIC shall ignore any RIC SUBSCRIPTION RESPONSE or RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message received after the initiation of the RIC Subscription Delete procedure and remove any reference and release any resources related to the concerned E2.
8.2.1.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the target E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing RIC Subscription Details IE that does not align with the Near-RT RIC Service Model [3], the target E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC with an appropriate cause value.
If the target E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message which contains a RAN Function ID IE that was not previously announced as a supported RAN function in the E2 Setup procedure or the RIC Service Update procedure, the target E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC with an appropriate cause value.
If the target E2 Node receives a RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST message containing identical contents, that is, same RAN Function ID IE, same RIC Event Trigger Definition IE and same sequence of actions, the target E2 Node shall send the RIC SUBSCRIPTION FAILURE message to the Near-RT RIC with an appropriate cause value.

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: Near-RT RIC Indication procedure, successful operation
An E2 Node initiates the procedure by sending RIC INDICATION message containing the RIC Request ID IE, that was previously assigned by the Near-RT RIC during a successful RIC Subscription procedure, along with associated, RAN Function ID IE, RIC Action ID IE, optionally sequence number RIC Indication SN IE, RIC Indication Type IE, RIC Indication Header IE, RIC Indication Message IE and optionally a RIC Call Process ID IE, assigned by the E2 Node, to the Near-RT RIC.
-	If the RIC Indication message is in response to RIC Subscription with RIC Action Type IE as "Insert", then the E2 Node shall provide the RIC Call Process ID IE within the RIC INDICATION message, and the E2 Node shall store current call state, start the associated RIC Time to Wait timer, and suspend further processing of the associated RAN function.
The receiving Near-RT RIC shall use the RIC Request ID IE to route the Indication to the Near-RT RIC functionality that originated the corresponding RIC Subscription procedure.
If present, the receiving Near-RT RIC may use the RIC Call Process ID IE in a subsequent RIC Control procedure.
If the E2 Node had stored an associated RIC Subsequent Action IE then, after successful transmission of the RIC INDICATION message, the originating E2 Node shall progress accordingly:
-	If the RIC Subsequent Action Type IE was set to Continue or Halt, the associated RIC Time to Wait timer has not yet expired, and a RIC CONTROL REQUEST message is received with the same RIC Call Process ID IE, then the E2 Node shall use the RIC CONTROL REQUEST information along with the stored call state and continue to execute any remaining actions in the sequence of RIC Actions defined in the RIC Subscription procedure prior to resuming normal functionality of the associated RAN function.
-	If the RIC Subsequent Action Type IE was set to Continue and the associated RIC Time to Wait timer has expired, then the E2 Node shall use the stored call state and continue to execute any remaining actions in the sequence of RIC Actions defined in the RIC Subscription procedure prior to resuming normal functionality of the associated RAN function.
-	If the RIC Subsequent Action Type IE was set to Halt and the associated RIC Time to Wait timer has expired, then the E2 Node shall abort normal functionality of the associated RAN function. In this case, any remaining actions in the sequence of RIC Actions defined in the RIC Subscription procedure shall also be aborted.

The Near-RT RIC initiates the procedure by sending the RIC CONTROL REQUEST message containing the RIC Request ID IE, assigned by the Near-RT RIC, RAN Function ID IE, optionally RIC Call Process ID IE, RIC Control Header IE, RIC Control Message IE and optionally RIC Control Ack Request IE to the E2 Node.
When the Near-RT RIC sends the RIC CONTROL REQUEST message and the optional RIC Control Ack Request IE has been set to "Ack", or is not present, the Near-RT RIC, it shall start the timer TRICcontrol.
At reception of the RIC CONTROL REQUEST message the target E2 Node shall:
-	Determine the target function using the information in the RAN Function ID IE and initiate the requested RIC Control procedure action using information in the RIC Control Message IE.
-	If the RIC Call Process ID IE is included in the RIC CONTROL REQUEST message, the E2 Node shall use this IE to identify a specific call process that was previously announced in the RIC INDICATION message and, after confirming that the request has arrived prior to the RIC Time to Wait timer had expired, clear the timer.
-	If the RIC CONTROL REQUEST message contains the optional RIC Control Ack Request IE set to “Ack”, or if the optional RIC Control Ack Request IE is not present, and the E2 Node has successfully processed the requested RIC Control procedure action, then the E2 Node shall respond with the RIC CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGE message and continue call processing.
-	If the RIC CONTROL REQUEST message contains the optional RIC Control Ack Request IE set to “NoAck” and the E2 Node has successfully processed the requested RIC Control procedure action, then the E2 Node shall continue call processing.
Upon reception of the RIC CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGE message, the Near-RT RIC shall stop the timer TRICcontrol and terminate the RIC Control procedure. The Near-RT RIC may use the information contained in the optional RIC Control Outcome IE to determine subsequent actions.

Upon reception of a RIC SERVICE UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall update the information for E2 Node as follows:
Update of Supported Near-RT RIC service Information:
-	If the RAN Function Added List IE is contained in the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall add each listed accepted function information according to the information in the RAN Function ID IE and RAN Function Definition IE and store the corresponding RAN Function Revision IE.
-	If the RAN Function Modified List IE is contained in the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall modify accepted information of supported functions according to the information in the RAN Function Definition IE and update the corresponding RAN Function Revision IE.
-	If the RAN Function Deleted List IE is contained in the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message, Near-RT RIC shall delete information of RAN Function indicated by the RAN Function ID IE along with the corresponding RAN Function Revision IE.
These changes may be processed in the Near-RT-RIC and may be used when issuing RIC SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST and RIC CONTROL to provide valid RAN Function ID IE.
If at least one RAN Function update request present in the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message is successful, then the Near-RT RIC shall send the RIC SERVICE UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the initiating E2 Node with the RAN Functions Accepted List IE indicating accepted requests to add, modify, and/or delete the corresponding RAN Function information and, if required, the RAN Functions Rejected List IE indicating rejected requests to add, modify, and/or delete the corresponding RAN Function information.
If the Near-RT RIC receives a RIC SERVICE UPDATE message without any IE except for Message Type IE, then the Near-RT RIC shall reply with RIC SERVICE UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message without any IE except for Message Type IE without performing any updates to the existing configuration.
Optionally, the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message to the Near-RT RIC may have been sent as a response to the Near-RT RIC initiated RIC SERVICE QUERY message. Upon reception of the RIC SERVICE QUERY message:
-	If the RAN Function Accepted List IE is not present, the E2 Node shall send the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message with the complete list of supported RAN Functions in the RAN Function Added List IE
-	If the RAN Function Accepted List IE is present and aligns with the list of supported RAN Functions at the E2 Node, the E2 Node shall send the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message without the RAN Function Added List IE, RAN Function Modified List IE and RAN Function Deleted List IE.
-	If the RAN Function Accepted List IE is present and the list of RAN Functions in the RAN Function Accepted List IE does not align with the list of supported RAN Functions at the E2 node, the E2 Node shall send the RIC SERVICE UPDATE message with the RAN Function Added List IE, RAN Function Modified List IE and/or RAN Function Deleted List IE to ensure realignment of RAN Functions between the E2 Node and the Near-RT RIC.

9.2	Information Element definitions
9.2.0	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.
9.2.1	Cause
The purpose of the Cause IE is to indicate the reason for a particular event for the E2AP protocol.
The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
9.2.2	Criticality Diagnostics
The Criticality Diagnostics IE is sent by the E2 Node or the Near-RT RIC when parts of a received message have not been comprehended or were missing, or if the message contained logical errors. When applicable, it contains information about which IEs were not comprehended or were missing.
For further details on how to use the Criticality Diagnostics IE, (see clause 10). The conditions for inclusion of the Transaction ID IE are described in clause 10.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
E2AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 [15], ITU-T Rec. X.680 [16] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [17].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of E2AP messages. E2AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an E2AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If an E2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
9.3.2	Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard are not supported with E2AP.
