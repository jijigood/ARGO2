Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by WG6 of the O-RAN Alliance.
The content of the present document is subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of version date and an increase in version number as follows:
version xx.yy.zz
where:
xx:	the first digit-group is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc. (the initial approved document will have xx=01).  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
yy:	the second digit-group is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
zz:	the third digit-group included only in working versions of the document indicating incremental changes during the editing process. External versions never include the third digit-group.  Always 2 digits with leading zero if needed.
Modal verbs terminology
In the present document "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot" are to be interpreted as described in clause 3.2 of the O-RAN Drafting Rules (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions).
"must" and "must not" are NOT allowed in O-RAN deliverables except when used in direct citation.
1	Scope

4	Objective
The present document delivers a specification of the information elements and attributes applicable to the ASD.
5	Conventions
The attributes of the ASD information elements are described in the tables provided in section 6.2. Each table has 5 columns, with the following significance:
The "Attribute" column provides the attribute name.
The "Qualifier" column indicates whether the support of the attribute is mandatory, optional or conditional from the SMO perspective.
The "Cardinality" column contains the minimum and maximum cardinality of this information element (e.g., 1, 0 … N, 1 … N). A cardinality range starting with 0 indicates that the attribute need not always be included and 1 indicates that the attribute needs to be always included.
The "Type" column provides information on the type of the attribute values. It can be the name of an Information Element. If a cell in the "Type" is marked as "Not specified", which indicates that the specification of the type is left to the data model.
The "Description" provides a brief explanatory description, additional constraints, and examples.
6	Application Service Descriptor information elements
6.1 	Overview
The Application Service Descriptor (ASD) contains data that describes an application and that is used by the SMO as input for the deployment of the application workload.
The ASD is a complementary descriptor to the cloud-native deployment artifacts. Hence, it contains design-time information provided by the application vendor that is not described/available in the cloud native artifacts. Such complementary information in the ASD can include specific infrastructure capabilities requirements for the deployment of the application software workload, constraints on the Kernel type needed, additional networking requirements needed beyond primary connectivity described in the cloud native artifacts, any special CNI (Container Network Interfaces), etc [i.1].
ASD can support an application workload deployment on OS container infrastructures, and it is applicable to O-RAN NF Deployments, xApps, and rApps.
Figure 6.1-1 illustrates the representation of O-RAN OAM Application Packaging Model as depicted in version 10.00 of [i.2] and shows how the Application Service Descriptor is positioned within the Application Package Model.

6.2 	Application Service Descriptor Information Element
For the O-RAN NF Deployments the Application Service Descriptor (ASD) is a main top level descriptor template which consists of the attributes described in Table 6.2-1 below.
Table 6.2-1: ASD Information Model
6.3 	Deployment Item (DeploymentItem) Information Element
The deploymentItem defined in O-RAN Operations and Maintenance Architecture [i.2] is realized by the DeploymentItem IE which has the DeploymentItem structure described in Table 6.3-1 below.
The DeploymentItem IE describes the type of cloud native artifact, its order of deployment in case multiple cloud native artifacts are employed with the same ASD, and the list of parameters that can be parameterized in this cloud native deployment artifact at deployment time.
Table 6.3-1: DeploymentItem IE
6.4 	External connection point (ExtCpd) Information Element
The ExtCpd IE describes endpoints exposed by the application to enable orchestrators to string together or optimally place linked applications.
Table 6.4-1: ExtCpd IE
6.5	NetworkInterfaceRealizationRequirements Information Element
The NetworkInterfaceRealizationRequirements IE describes details related to secondary networks that attach the OS containers to the logical or physical networks.
Table 6.5-1 NetworkInterfaceRealizationRequirements IE
6.6	ExtCpdParamMappings Information Element
The ExtCpdParamMappings IE describes required information on what parameters to be provided to the deployment tools for the ExtCpd instance.
Table 6.6-1: ExtCpdParamMappings IE
6.7	EnhancedClusterCapabilities Information Element
The EnhancedClusterCapabilities IE describes information which is used to aid placement of the application service on a suitable cluster.
