4 Use Case Description 
4.1 O-RAN TE&IV Use Cases 
4.1.1 Use case 1: O-RAN network provisioning 
4.1.1.1 Background and goal of the use case 
The O-RAN Provisioning use case in WG10 OAM Architecture Specification [i.2] describes the sequence of steps to deploy 
and provision O-RAN NFs on physical/virtualized resources by leveraging the SMO Framework and O-Cloud management 
entities. 
The goal of this use case is to highlight the role of Topology Exposure (TE) and Inventory Management (IV) services during 
provisioning of O-RAN NFs. This use case leverages flows of O-RAN provisioning use case and highlights the interactions of 
O-RAN entities with TE&IV service producer. These interactions are for CRUD operations on inventory objects 
corresponding to the newly deployed NFs. 
NOTE: Throughout this document, as defined in [i.9], the term NF implies that it can be deployed as one of PNF or cloudified 
NF. A cloudified NF can be realized via one or many NF Deployments, as per [i.9], which can be a VNF or a CNF.  
4.1.1.2 Entities/resource involved in the use case 
The SMO Framework leverages TE &IV services within the SMO. TE&IV services maintain the state of O-RAN NFs in the 
TE&IV repositories, which will be used by TE&IV Service Consumers within the SMO Framework to derive the contextual 
information of the network. TE&IV services support CRUD operations on inventory objects in TE&IV repositories and 
interactions with TE&IV Service Consumers.

Goal O-RAN network provisioning using TE&IV services   
Actors and Roles 
[1]. Service Management and Orchestration Framework: TE&IV Service Producer 
and TE&IV Service Consumer (such as Non-RT RIC Services, RAN NF OAM 
Services, O-Cloud Resources Management and Orchestration Services) 
[2]. O-Cloud: DMS 
[3]. PNF (e.g., O-RU, O-DU) 
[4]. VNF (e.g., Near RT-RIC, xApps, O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP)  
[5]. Consumers of the SMO services which are authorized to use TE&IV Service 
Producer services  
 
Assumptions 
Common Topology and Inventory Model is available in TE&IV Service Producer 
EXAMPLE: For the purpose of this use case, the TE&IV inventory objects follow the 
Inventory object status values highlighted in Annex A   
 
 
Pre-conditions 
[1]. O-RAN Service Design completed as per WG10 OAM Architecture Specification 
Clause 4.2.1.3 
[2]. O-RAN Network Planning completed as per Clause 4.1.5.3 and inventory 
objects are created with status as Planned 
[3]. The PNF is constructed/installed and ready to be registered and Activated 
[4]. The cloudified NF Software Package has been uploaded to the O-Cloud 
[5]. Secure network connectivity is already available between RAN components 
[6]. O-DU and O-RU are PNFs and the inventory objects corresponding to these 
RAN Nodes are available in the TE&IV repositories with a Planned status and 
ready to be registered and activated 
[7]. On boarding of cloudified NF Descriptors to the O-Cloud is completed 
[8]. TE&IV Service Producer is ready to accept requests from TE&IV Service 
Consumers 
 
 
Begins when  
The personnel authorized for initiating the Network provisioning operation, decides to 
deploy an O-RAN network in specific geo-location e.g., location identified using TE&IV 
services. Refer to WG10 OAM Architecture Specification Clause 4.2.1.3 for details.  
 
O-RAN Service Deployment 
 
Step 1 (M) TE&IV Service Consumer sends a query to the TE&IV Service Producer to get Planned 
O-RAN Service inventory objects  
Step 2 (M) Response from TE&IV Service Producer with details of the Planned inventory objects  
Step 3 (O) 
TE&IV Service Consumer updates the inventory objects with deployment specific 
parameter values. The request also transitions the O-RAN Service inventory object 
status to Assigned.  
NOTE: It is assumed that any resource reservation if required is carried out at this stage  
 
Step 4 (O) Confirmation of successful inventory object update in TE&IV Repository   
 
Deployment details of the O-RAN Service is omitted. Refer to the deployment details of 
cloudified NF and PNF described below in steps 4.1.1 to 4.1.6 (for cloudified NF) and 
4.2.1 to 4.2.4 (for PNF Registration) 
 
Step 5 (M) 
In case of a successful deployment of the O-RAN Service, the TE&IV Service Consumer 
sends a request to TE&IV Service Producer to update the inventory object with the 
details of the O-RAN Service being deployed and the status of the corresponding 
inventory object is changed to Deployed.  
 
In case of a failure in deployment of O-RAN Service, the status of the O-RAN Service 
inventory objects remains Assigned so that the deployment can be re-initiated without 
repeated assignment of parameter values. The use case flow stops with the deployment 
failure. The subsequent flows are continued once the retry results in a successful 
deployment.

Step 6 (M) Confirmation of the status update on O-RAN Service Inventory Object in TE&IV 
Repository  
Step 7 (M) 
After completion of the RAN Node deployment, once the status of the associated 
inventory objects are updated as Deployed, the O-RAN Service activation is initiated.  
 
Refer to steps 4.1.7 to 4.1.10 for details of the cloudified NF and steps 4.2.5 to 4.2.8 for 
PNF.  
 
On successful completion of RAN Node activation, the status of the O-RAN Service 
inventory object is transitioned to Active. 
 
In case the O-RAN Service activation failed (or if any of the RAN Node activation failed), 
the status remains in Deployed. The use case flow stops with the activation failure of O-
RAN Service. The subsequent flows are continued once the retry results in a successful 
activation. 
 
Step 8 (M) Confirmation of the status update on O-RAN Service Inventory Object in TE&IV 
Repository   
4.1 Cloudified NF Deployment and Activation 
 For the cloudified NF (e.g., O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, Near-RT RIC, xApps etc.) deployment 
details refer to WG10 OAM Architecture Specification Clause 4.2.1.3 Steps 5-10   
Step 4.1.1 (O) For the deployment of Cloudified NF (i.e VNF or CNF), the TE&IV Service Consumer 
retrieves planned inventory from TE&IV Repository   
Step 4.1.2 (O) TE&IV Service Producer responds with the Planned inventory details.   
 Steps 11 - 18 is repeated for each cloudified NF deployed  
Step 4.1.3 (O)   
TE&IV Service Consumer updates the inventory objects with deployment specific 
parameter values. The status of the RAN Node inventory object is updated as Assigned.  
 
Step 4.1.4 (O) Confirmation of the RAN Node inventory object update in TE&IV Repository   
Step 4.1.5 (O) Once deployment of the RAN Node is completed, on successful completion TE&IV 
Service Consumer updates the RAN Node inventory object with deployment details and 
the status is changed to Deployed. In case of a failure in the deployment of the RAN 
Node, the status remains as Assigned so that the re-deployment can be initiated without 
re-assignment of the inventory object parameter values.  
 
Step 4.1.6 (M) Confirmation of the Status update of RAN Node as Deployed in TE&IV Repository   
Step 4.1.7 (M) RAN Node is provisioned with the runtime configuration. On successful completion of the 
provisioning, the TE&IV Service Consumer updates the status of the RAN Node 
inventory object as Active. In case of a failure the inventory object remains in the 
Deployed state.  
 
Step 4.1.8 (M) Confirmation of the Status update of RAN Node as Active in TE&IV Repository   
Step 4.1.9 (M) Once the management and control plane connectivity is established with the RAN Node, 
the TE&IV Service Consumer updates the planned topology object with the updated 
inventory details 
 
Step 4.1.10 (M) Confirmation of the Topology object update in TE&IV repository   
4.2 PNF Registration & Activation 
 For the PNF (e.g., O-DU, O-RU) Deployment details refer to WG10 OAM Architecture 
Specification Clause 4.2.1.3 Steps 23-40 for details. Steps 19-26 are repeated for each 
PNF being deployed.  
NOTE: PNF details are assumed to be part of the planned inventory which is retrieved by 
TE&IV Service Consumer in steps 1-2 
 
Step 4.2.1 (O) TE&IV Service Consumer updates the inventory objects with deployment specific 
parameter values such as the RAN Node identifier. The status of the RAN Node 
inventory object is updated as Assigned.

4.1.2.4 Required data 
TE&IV Service Producer has the relationship information about the cells and NF deployments associated with geo -location. 
The query request to TE&IV Service Producer contains the geo-location [1], cell type and NF Deployment type. TE&IV 
service returns identities of the requested cell and its associated NF deployment in the requested geo-location. 
The Query alarm information request contains the rAppId and optional query information. The query info rmation determines 
the requested alarm information, for instance a single alarm with a particular alarm ID, all alarms in the alarm list or a su bset of 
these alarms that match a set of filtering parameters. 
The Query alarm information response contains the requested alarm information scoped by the query information provided in 
the request. 
4.1.3 Use case 3: Terminate NF Deployment on O-Cloud 
4.1.3.1 Background and goal of the use-case 
The goal of automation of lifecycle management of NFs is to attain servic e agility and lower operational costs in a service 
provider's network. Automated lifecycle management enables the service provider to deploy and terminate services within a 
short span of time.  
When services are terminated, the allocated resources and constituent NFs are terminated and become available for 
consumption by other services.  
This use case highlights the interaction of SMO with TE&IV services for deleting resources in the TE&IV repositories when 
NF Deployments are terminated on O-Cloud, based on the use case "Terminate Network Function on O-Cloud" in [i.9].

Goal 
To delete an active NF from the TE&IV repository. This requires that the active 
NF is deactivated prior to termination of the NF deployment which allows for 
the deletion of the inventory object associated with the NF from the TE&IV 
repository. 
 
Actors and Roles 
Network Function Install Project Manager 
SMO: NFO, SMOS Consumer such as NFO, TE&IV Service Producer 
O-Cloud: DMS 
Network Function  
 
Assumptions 
[1]. The “Service Request” to the SMO includes the identifiers of the 
network function instance(s) to be terminated. 
[2]. The Network Function Install Project Manager has subscribed to 
receive notifications from the SMO 
[3]. The network function(s) to be terminated do not handle calls and do 
not provide services. SMOS Consumer (e.g., NFO) and DMS perform 
the needed actions for terminating the NFs on the O-Cloud 
[4]. NF Termination is an asynchronous operation and SMOS Consumer 
notifies the TE&IV Service Producer about the termination status 
 
EXAMPLE: For the purpose of this use case, the TE&IV inventory objects 
follow the inventory object status model values highlighted in Annex A   
 
Pre-condition [1]. SMO is available   
Begins when  
Existing Network Function(s) are determined to be terminated on the O-Cloud 
and corresponding inventory object details are queried on TE&IV Service 
Producer 
 
Step 1 (M) 
Network Function Install Project Manager requests NFO to terminate the 
network function instance(s) by providing the identifiers of the network function 
instance(s). 
 
 
For each NF deployment associated with each Network Function in the 
Service Request, the steps 2 to 8 are executed. 
The details on how the SMOS Consumer and DMS perform the termination 
operation in O-Cloud is omitted. Refer to [i.9] clause 3.2.5 for more details.  
 
NOTE: NF Termination is an asynchronous process that may go through 
multiple stages of operation. SMOS Consumer notifies TE&IV Service 
Producer when the NF is deactivated initially prior to graceful termination and 
resource deallocation. 
 
Step 2 (M) If TE&IV Service Producer subscribed to NF Deactivation events from SMOS 
Consumer, a notification is sent to TE&IV Service Producer indicating the 
deactivation status. 
 
Step 3 (M) TE&IV Service Producer updates the resource inventory object status in the 
TE&IV repositories (e.g., from Active to Deployed).  
Step 4 (M) TE&IV Service Producer sends the updated resource inventory object status 
to SMOS Consumer.  
Step 5 (M) 
If TE&IV Service Producer has not subscribed to SMOS Consumer 
notification, a request to update the resource inventory object status is sent to 
TE&IV Service Producer and the corresponding status change is updated on 
the TE&IV repositories (e.g., from Active to Deployed). 
 
Step 6 (M) Status of the inventory object update sent to SMOS Consumer.

 Steps 7 to 15 are for TE&IV Service operations after successful resource 
deallocation and termination of the NF in O-Cloud  
Step 7 (M) If TE&IV Service Producer subscribed to SMOS Consumer notifications, the 
termination completion notification is received by the TE&IV Service Producer.  
Step 8 (M) TE&IV Service Producer updates the status of the corresponding resource 
inventory object (e.g., Deployed to Assigned)  
Step 9 (M) Status of the inventory object update sent to SMOS Consumer  
Step 10 (M) 
If TE&IV Service Producer has not subscribed to TE&IV Service Consumer 
notification, a request to update the resource inventory object status is initiated 
by SMOS Consumer. The TE&IV Service Producer updates the resource 
inventory object status in TE&IV repositories (e.g., Deployed to Assigned) 
 
Step 11 (M) Status of the inventory object update sent to SMOS Consumer  
Step 12 (O) SMOS Consumer initiates request to delete the resource inventory objects 
from TE&IV repository  
Step 13 (O) TE&IV Service Producer deletes the corresponding resources from TE&IV 
repositories  
Step 14 (O) Status of the inventory object update sent to TE&IV Service Consumer  
Step 15 (M) 
Based on the subscription of NF termination status notification, SMOS 
Consumer notifies the Network Function Install Project Manager that the 
Network Function(s) have been terminated. 
 
Ends when Network Function(s) in the O-Cloud have been terminated.  
Exceptions None identified  
Post Conditions 
[1]. Network Function(s) have been terminated.  
[2]. The consumer may unsubscribe to receive notification related to 
terminated NF instance(s) from SMO.

4.1.3.4 Required Data 
TE&IV Service Producer may use the NF Deployment identifier to delete the inventory objects of the NF Deployments from 
TE&IV repositories. 
4.1.4 Use case 4: Topology based alarm correlation  
This use case provides the background, motivation, and requirements for Topology based alarm correlation, allowing operators 
to resolve or handle the alarms triggered through O1, O2 and M-Plane interface (in case of hybrid O-RU) using Topology 
Exposure and Inventory Management services, thereby reducing effort for root cause a nalysis of alarms. 
4.1.4.1 Background and goal of the use case 
Faults are inevitable in big distributed system like O-RAN. Unhandled alarms will degrade the performance of the O-RAN 
network and will impact the users. It is important to quickly find the rel ationship between different alarms. Faults in O1 nodes 
are reported through O1 interface, faults in O-Cloud resources are reported through O2 interface and faults in the O-RU are 
reported through M-Plane interface. With disaggregated nature of O-RAN architecture, it becomes difficult to determine the 
relationship between alarms raised in O1 node or O-Cloud or O-RU. Topology and Inventory models with capability to show 
relationship between RAN resources, O-Cloud resources and transport resources is required to pinpoint the relationship 
between alarming resources. 
                              
Sample scenario: Internal network switch failure in O-Cloud may impact NF Deployments which might affect the O-RAN 
network. Different alarms will be raised over O2, O1 and M-Plane interface as result of cascading effect of failure of an 
internal network switch in O-Cloud.   
Topology based alarm correlation can query the TE&IV Service Producer to understand the relationships between the 
topology/inventory resources and the alarmed resources.  
The objective of this use case is to leverage TE&IV services for alarm correlation  to determine the root cause of a problem. 
4.1.4.2 Entities/resource involved in the use case 
1) TE&IV Service Consumer (e.g., an rApp) 
a) Query the TE&IV Service Producer to get the relationship between alarmed resources 
2) TE&IV Service Producer 
a) Exposes TE&IV services based on Topology and Inventory Models and APIs, which offe rs among others the 
capability to provide the relationship between resources provided by O1 nodes, O -Cloud and O-RU 
b) Consumes the data provided by the SMO functions (e.g., O1-related data, O2-related data, DME, SME) and 
exposes it via the Topology and Inventory Models and APIs

4.1.5 Use case 5: O-RAN Network Planning 
4.1.5.1 Background and goal of the use case 
Network planning enables CSPs to design, manage and optimize networks efficiently. Network planning and network design 
aim at ensuring that the new telecommunications network operates at optimum cost and has sufficient capacity and reliability 
to meet the needs of the subscriber and operator. With the advent of cloud native technologies and the ability to iterate and 
deploy quickly through containers, microservices etc., the time period between network planning and design to network 
deployment and realization has reduced significantly compared to the traditional process. 
The Inventory function supports the network planning process by storing and providing information regarding planned 
networks. TE&IV services enable bulk upload of network data to TE&IV repositories, which eases planning and deployment 
of large-scale networks. 
The objective of this use case is to illustrate the use of bulk upload services offered by TE&IV Service Producer during O -
RAN network planning. 
NOTE: File format for bulk upload of network data is dependent on the common topology and inventory model and is not 
covered in this specification.

Step 9 (M) 
Alternate 
Query/Response 
FOCOM returns status [Success] and the cluster resource information to the 
TE&IV Service Producer 
 
Step 10 (M) 
Alternate 
Query/Response 
TE&IV Service Producer updates the inventory record identified by the 
Inventory Record Id with as built details from the Cluster Info moving it from a 
"Assigned" state towards "Deployed" state. 
 
Step 11 (M) 
Alternate 
Query/Response 
TE&IV Service Producer returns the status (success/fail) of the request to 
transition from "Assigned" to "Deployed" to the TE&IV Service Consumer. 
 
Step 12 (M) 
Alternate 
Notification 
If the TE&IV Service Consumer has subscribed to change notifications and the 
inventory information for the O-Cloud Node Cluster was updated an 
asynchronous event is published by the TE&IV Service Producer to the TE&IV 
Service Consumer. 
 
Step 13 (M) 
After ensuring the O-Cloud Node Cluster is ready for use by other SMO 
Functions the TE&IV Service Consumer requests an update to the Node 
Cluster inventory record to indicate it has transitioned from the "Deployed" 
state to the "Active" state. 
 
Step 14 (M) 
TE&IV Service Producer returns a status of the operation. For this use case it 
is assumed that the response indicates success. If the operation failed the 
state remains unchanged, thus the request can be re-issued once the failure 
problem has been remediated. 
 
Step 15 (M) SMOS Consumer requests the Node Cloud Cluster inventory details.  
Step 16 (M) TE&IV Service Consumer sends a request to TE&IV Service Producer to get 
the details of a planned O-Cloud Node Cluster matching specific criteria. 
 
Ends when TE&IV Service Producer returns the corresponding Node Cluster Inventory 
data 
 
Exceptions None identified.  
Post Conditions 
The TE&IV Service Producer shall maintain and notify the latest status of the 
O-Cloud Node Cluster information to TE&IV Service Consumer(s) 
based on future subscription requests.

4.1.7.4 Required Data 
TE&IV Service Producer has the connectivity, infrastructure and location information of O-Cloud(s) and O-Cloud Node 
Clusters. 
A unique identifier is assigned during creation of TE&IV resource in the TE&IV repositories, which is returned by the TE&IV 
Service Producer in the response for create operation. 
The unique identifier assigned during creation of TE&IV resource is in the Cluster Information provided by the FOCOM such 
that the TE&IV Service Producer can associate the O-Cloud Node Cluster with its corresponding inventory record. 
4.1.8 Use case 8: Handling Cloud Site Outage Using TE&IV Services  
4.1.8.1 Background and goal of the use case 
Due to some outage or failure, a cloud site serving a node at a popular public event goes down. An rApp acting as a TE&IV 
Service Consumer monitoring this, uses TE&IV services to find out what O -RAN network function(s) will be impacted by this 
outage. The rApp is given only the details of the cloud site facing the outage through alarms generated by the cloud provider. 
For the rApp to identify the O-RAN Network Function instances, it would need to query TE&IV Service Producer to retrieve 
the list of topology attributes from the Cloud, the RAN, and the relationship between the RAN and the Cloud domains.  
Towards this goal, the rApp queries TE&IV Service producer to list the available NF Deployments from the Cloud namespace 
and its relationship to the O-RAN Network Function instances in the RAN namespace. Finally, the rApp queries the topology 
attributes in the RAN Namespace from the TE&IV Service Producer which would then be identified and recommended to an 
Orchestrator within the SMO to perform a rehoming of the affected O-RAN Network Functions to a functional cloud site to 
avoid network disruption. 
The motivation of this use case is to highlight the role of TE&IV services in rehoming O -RAN NFs to a viable cloud site to 
avoid network disruption at a popular public event. This use case leverages the O-RAN NF and O-Cloud models as outlined in 
[2], and the RAN-O-Cloud relationship exposed by TE&IV Service Producer. 
4.1.8.2 Entities/resources involved in the use case 
1) TE&IV Service Consumer as rApp 
a) Queries TE&IV Service Producer to retrieve the relationships and properties of Cloud and RAN resources across 
operator’s network. 
2) TE&IV Service Producer  
a) Exposes TE&IV services based on Topology and Inventory Models and APIs, which offers among others the  
capability to provide the relationship between resources provided by Cloud and RAN. 
b) Consumes the data provided by SMO functions and exposes it via the Topology and Inventory Models and APIs.
